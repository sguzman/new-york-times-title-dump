He was a superb natural athlete and insightful and elegant writer. Author of Tough Draw, regarded by Arthur Ashe and Herbert Warren Wind as one of the best books ever on the game of tennis and the psychology of competition, Eliot brought to his craft a novelist's eye and ear, a scholar's encyclopedic knowledge and joy of literature, and an accomplished competitive athlete's awareness of the exhilaration and lonely struggles of athletic competition at the highest levels. He was inducted into the University of Pennsylvania Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000 in recognition of his achievements in football, squash and tennis. He was All-Ivy in all three sports. As a place kicker, he was signed to both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Atlanta Falcons; a gifted tennis player from a young age, he won the New York State 16s, was third-ranked in the East and played on the 1970 ECAC Championship Team; and in squash he played on the international tour, was number one for the U.S. Team at the World Championships in 1977 and won the Metropolitan Squash Singles Championship in 198082. Eliot's other published works included a novel, literary criticism and Topspin, another acclaimed book on the professional tennis tour. At the time of his death Eliot had recently completed an authorized screenplay of Albert Camus's iconic The Stranger. He was founder and principal of Eliot W. Berry & Co., real estate appraisers. A memorial service will be held at St. James' Church, Madison Avenue and 71st Street, Friday, December 5, at 12 noon.

The &#8220;Secret Invasion&#8221; series has been a best-seller for Marvel; its first issue sold more than 270,000 copies. So what will its author, Brian Michael Bendis, do for a follow-up? &#8220;What we really need to do is spend some time with the characters and deal with the aftermath of all that&#8217;s happened,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We need to dig deep down and see what they&#8217;re made of.&#8221;."

He joined Abrams & Martin, P.C., our predecessor firm, and immediately excelled in defending Lloyd's Underwriters and domestic insurance companies in Federal and State Court litigations. Over the course of his 32 year legal career, Dan's skill and professionalism earned him the respect of his clients and adversaries, one of whom wrote ''A Hole in the Wall'', a novel that detailed a litigation involving a fraudulent insurance claim. The insurer's attorney was fashioned after Dan. Dan exemplified what a ''partner'' in law firm should be -he was a wise counselor, mentor and teacher. His work ethic and dedication to our firm, the law and his clients is revealed in the exhausting schedule he maintained despite his illness, culminating a few weeks ago in an oral argument before the New York Court of Appeals.

The ornate headpieces and dome-shaped heels (the work of the outside ateliers the house supports), along with the occasionally jarring suit proportions and Cossack trousers, brought to mind the words ""bookish"" and ""displacement."" Lagerfeld knows this particular world, its art and its culture, very well, and I love that he considered Coco Chanel's Russian alliances and as well the influences of Russian émigrés in Paris after the revolution. The coats were lovely and romantic, especially #12 on Vlada, and there was a kind of genius in the black and white embroidered evening looks, their effect like scratches on the back of a smoked mirror. Did the collection feel entirely contemporary? Or is that necessary for a special show like this? I'm interested in your thoughts."

Today marks Repeal Day - a national holiday celebrating the end of Prohibition - a day of remembrance and, perhaps more urgently, a duty to get three sheets to the wind. While you won't find Repeal Day on the December 5 slot of your week-at-a-glance calendar, few would argue with the sobering importance of such an historic occasion. Seventy-five years ago on this very date, the 18th Amendment, the Volstead Act, was repealed, forever ending the crime against spirits."

2008-12-05T00:00:00Z,"BéLA FLECK & THE FLECKTONES: 'JINGLE ALL THE WAY' (Rounder) Growling Tuvan throat singing takes over ''Jingle Bells.'' ''Silent Night'' becomes modal jazz with abstruse harmonies. ''The 12 Days of Christmas'' zigzags through a maze of meter shifts and key changes (perhaps ''The 12 Tones of Christmas''?). And Tchaikovsky's ''Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies'' pings its melody in harmonics from Béla Fleck's banjo. Those are just four of the virtuosic transformations Mr. Fleck and his band come up with on an album that applies all sorts of musicianly gamesmanship to Christmas songs (and one Hanukkah tune) that can sometimes take an aural squint to recognize. Bluegrass and jazz are the Flecktones' foundations, as can be heard in their nimble version of ''Sleigh Ride.'' But the song choices are eclectic -- Bach, klezmer, Joni Mitchell, ''Linus and Lucy'' from ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' -- and the arrangements even more so. Give these musicians a musical parameter and they'll toy with it. JON PARELES"

Beloved brother of Rita Lowenthal of Pembroke Pines, FL. Caring uncle of Richard Lowenthal of Austin, Texas and and Mark Lowenthal of Berlin, Germany. Dedicated scholar, inspirational teacher, compassionate therapist, loyal friend. Dr. Hassol was retired as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at CW Post Campus of Long Island University, where he had been on the faculty since 1967. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University in 1966 and taught there from 1960 to 1967. In 1973 he received a Post Doctoral Certificate in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis from NYU and had practiced until recently. He was a member of the NYU Psychoanalytic Association. His great passion was the study of ethics and morality and its relevance for psychiatry. Since 1985, Dr. Hassol served as President of the Board of the Neustadt Collection of Tiffany Glass, a New York nonprofit organization with a world-renowned collection of Tiffany lamps and glass.

The rest of this homogenous collection, though, all recorded on four-track machines by artists on Mr. Johnson's label, doesn't muster an ounce of that song's frisson. (Money Mark's cheeky ''Stuck at the Airport'' is a musical, if not thematic, exception.) ''We're finally all together/Feeling fine/Wearing reindeer sweaters,'' ALO's Zach Gill sings on ''Christmas Time''. It's the sound of a band of hippies shruggingly giving in to corporate sentiment.

In the Fleshtones' own songs ''super rock Santa makes the scene,'' but these rockers aren't infidels; there's piety behind the backbeat in songs like Peter Zaremba's ''I Still Believe in Christmas,'' on which he belts, ''Take a moment to recall the birth that's reason for it all/Now can't we use a little peace on Earth?''

''Recession is here, and the gifts cost cheddar,'' Mr. Jones raps on this new album -- finally, a topical Christmas song. For Mr. Jones and his crew -- Juelz Santana, Tom Gist, Noe and others -- Dec. 25 is just another day when the have-nots struggle to have. And so Christmas becomes a fulcrum on which to hinge lighthearted, occasionally clever rhymes about what it might take (robbery, drug dealing) to ensure that loved ones get the au courant gifts (Nintendo Wii, True Religion jeans) they want. ''We dreaming of a white Christmas,'' Mr. Jones raps, about a powder that isn't snow. ''Serving the fiends through the night shift.'' JON CARAMANICA"

Wisely, the female country stars on ''Christmas Duets'' try to match Elvis Presley's mood, whether it's Carrie Underwood's tenderness on ''I'll Be Home for Christmas'' or Wynonna Judd's brawn on ''Santa Claus Is Back in Town.'' On a wild eight-minute ''Merry Christmas Baby,'' Gretchen Wilson saunters up to the song, full of attitude, before giving in; it sounds as if she's flirting with Mr. Presley just across the bar. Trying to get that close to Nat King Cole, though, may be a fool's errand. On this collection his brief vocal snippets are treated like museum pieces. Of Cole's partners, only his daughter Natalie, on ''The Christmas Song,'' and Shelby Lynne, on a lingering ''Silent Night,'' don't sound as if they're harmonizing with a specter they can't quite hear.

Of course Mr. Bennett is a different singer now -- more avuncular, more casual -- and his genius lies in his phrasing.

2008-12-05T00:00:00Z,"As recession tightens its grip, the holiday season threatens to be less festive than usual. Consciously or not, much of this year's new holiday music expresses some anxiety about whether the old modes of merriment still matter. Dismantle old standards? Create new ones? Even bother celebrating at all? Here, notable holiday albums -- Christmas, mostly, with a little Hanukkah thrown in -- are reviewed by the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times. 'ALL WRAPPED UP' (Hollywood, available exclusively at Target) Any fears that Miley Cyrus is growing up too quickly should be allayed by her version of ''Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,'' which reveals her to be, appropriately, a bratty, possibly impudent teenager. This EP features artists signed to the Hollywood label, which includes the Disney stable: on ''Joyful Kings'' (a medley of ''Joy to the World'' and ''We Three Kings''), Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers sings as if he's petulantly recoiling from good will, and Demi Lovato displays taste by covering, with sass, Paul McCartney's ''Wonderful Christmastime.'' The label's non-Mickey signees need to find a way to distinguish themselves, which might explain Jordan Pruitt's soft R&B groove ''Celebrate Love,'' on which she breathily gives orders: ''Light up the candles/Dim all the lights/Now let the magic begin.'' Hey, wait a minute. ''Everyone's singing a carol/Or saying a prayer.'' Oh, that kind of magic. JON CARAMANICA"

Booker T. Jones, the organist who led the Stax studio band Booker T. & the MG's, sits in, and many of the songs have a soul-style horn section nudging Ms. Crow's voice along. It's an album of cozy versions of familiar material; she doesn't sound all that blue on ''Blue Christmas.'' But the tone is right for a new song by Ms. Crow: the hymnlike ''There Is a Star That Shines Tonight,'' which neatly mingles the personal and the political. JON PARELES"

Erran scored the ''Borat'' movie and contributed music to ''Da Ali G Show,'' but his own work, with the group Zohar, tends toward ambient lounge music infused with Middle East signifiers.

Tebow is the quintessential all-American-type, putting the Gators on his back and willing them to a hard-fought victory over a tough Alabama team.

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Underneath the imperturbable mien of the Samurai Spinner beats the rattlesnake-hissing heart of a rock critic. Fist-in-the-air truculence keeps my mojo stoked, ready to savage Muzak-riddled mediocrities who toss breakthrough bands down the same sinkhole as their 401(k)’s. I’d rant forever, but I, too, work for the Man. Or, in my case, the Old Gray Lady, who’s curious about cover tunes, the sometimes successful, sometimes tiresome recycling of pop music for love or money. Mostly money."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"I’m sitting in front of a long glass desk in the office of the architect Scope Cleaver. It’s quite a place, with undulating concrete walls, sharply angled yellow-tinted windows and long, cantilevered balconies. And then there is Cleaver himself. He has dark shoulder-length hair, he’s about 3 years old, and he can fly. Welcome to the surreal world of architecture in Second Life."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Anyone who still doubts that the worlds of art and fashion are intimately linked should take a look at Comme des Garçons’ mailers. The flyers, which announce store openings and other events, have lately become collectible items, thanks to the intriguing imagery they depict: Little Red Riding Hood engaged in tantalizing play with the wolf, babies giggling contentedly, porn stars doing what porn stars do best. The artwork, courtesy of the Argentine art collective Mondongo, is striking not just because of its thematic diversity but also because the gang works with decidedly unconventional materials like cookies, glass and raw beef. Mondongo — the name comes from a popular Latin American stew made with tripe — was formed in 1999 by Agustina Picasso, Manuel Mendanha and Juliana Laffitte, who were trained as traditional painters at art school in Buenos Aires. (Mendanha and Laffitte are now married and have a child.) Since they teamed up, no one in the group has gone back to painting, nor has any one of them worked alone. Instead, they create computer templates together, using photographs and downloaded images, which they manipulate and assemble to form quirky tableaus. The resulting blueprints are then brought to life with meticulously applied layers of plasticine, thread, mirrors, garbage bags."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"You can’t tell a book by its cover — or so they say. But you should be able to judge a gift by its wrappings. I am not talking about Martha Stewart-style origami with brown craft paper, raffia and fresh rosebuds, although I suppose someone out there has the patience to make such noble offerings. But I never cease to be surprised at how few brands have created that shiver of anticipation, the tingling of the skin that comes from recognizing the outside before the inner content is revealed."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"‘I set out to write a happy book.” So begins Ludwig Bemelmans’s foreword to “The Best of Times: An Account of Europe Revisited” (Simon & Schuster, out of print), a collection of essays published in 1948, in an attempt to dispel the pall cast by the war."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"I’m not going to pretend that I’m as green as I should be, but I try. Although I am still too frequent a flyer, and dither over whether to pop a wind turbine on the roof, I do bicycle whenever possible, seem hellbent on wrecking my Lanvin tote by cramming it with groceries rather than consigning another plastic bag to a landfill and spend much of my time recycling this, that or the other."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,Dinner with Martino Gamper is a do-it-yourself affair.
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"It was perhaps poor timing in August 2007 when Flavio Briatore, the playboy principal of Renault’s Formula One racing team, announced he would build the Billionaire’s Resort in sunny Malindi, his ex-girlfriend and presumptive business partner Naomi Campbell by his side. Kenya’s coastline has never been called trendy, per se, even if Bill Gates and Angelina Jolie have recently played through several of its white-sand beaches. But Malindi’s local M.P., Gideon Mung’aro, was somehow confident the hotel would “attract queens and kings and other world celebrities,” or so he told the press."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"ALONG ROUND HILL ROAD in Greenwich, Conn., the newer mansions were built for comfort and show. They are equipped with systems — security systems, illumination and irrigation systems, vacuuming systems and entertainment systems. There is a smoothness to life on Round Hill Road that is apparent even to a stranger. There might be trouble in some of the houses, for there is always trouble somewhere — trouble from debt, trouble from an unhappy marriage — but it seems a feature of new wealth, if not a requirement, that its participants be not too heavily invested in the sort of colossal dreams that built Newport and Houston, places that were built from money made in dangerous work like mining and oil. For whatever else an imitation of a French manor may suggest, it does not suggest, at least on Round Hill Road, danger or a great deal of imagination."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"I’ll give ’em the rock legs, Marion,” Alex James says as he poses for a picture. The former bassist for the British band Blur tosses his cigarette in the wet hay surrounding him, lets his bangs obscure one of his eyes and assumes that wide bass-player stance as seven Gloucester cows moo in the background. This shoot is not for Rolling Stone but for The Bisley News (circulation 200 plus), and it’s hard to tell who is the sexier “get”: James or the cows. Gloucester cows have only just grazed their way off the endangered list, and James is thinking of buying one more for his 200-acre farm in the Cotswolds. (Elizabeth Hurley’s brother bought two Gloucesters for her as a wedding gift, and James is on a waiting list for a calf — “like for an Aston Martin,” he says.) The seller is the woman taking his picture: Marion Conisbee-Smith, a veteran cheese crafter moonlighting as The Bisley News’s photographer."

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Where are the girdles of yesteryear? The ones women of all ages once wore as a matter of course, huffing and puffing as they tugged at the reinforced elastic and lace, the better to encase their bodies to trimmest effect. The ones that were so pivotal that the 19th-century sexologist Havelock Ellis felt compelled to weigh in, insisting that girdles were “morphologically essential” because the evolution from “horizontality to verticality” was more difficult for women than for men. (Without them, Ellis grandly theorized, “woman might be physiologically truer to herself if she went always on all fours” rather than try to imitate men by “standing erect.”) How is it, then, as I discovered when I went in quest of a girdle, that this once culturally mandated undie has disappeared from the sartorial landscape like so much melted snow?."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Fashion Conundrum 2008: What does the responsibly minded clotheshorse wear for the End of the World as We Know It? The markets have tanked. The planet’s on a high simmer. The fashion industry has responded to international belt- and guilt-tightening with two solutions: spend green or showcase a black sense of humor while you keep on shopping like it’s 2004. The work of the Los Angeles artist Bettina Hubby offers a third option that combines both greenness and a personalized high-fashion/high-art approach to soup-kitchen thrift. Hubby produces (sculptures may be the better word) new clothing from existing pieces. Specifically, she takes vintage garments by the likes of Issey Miyake and gives them second lives as one-of-a-kind objects. “The canvas is already stretched,” she says of using old designer clothes. “I love recreating things from what they already are.”."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Since founding the influential London fashion label Biba in the 1960s (a young Anna Wintour worked for her as a shop clerk), Barbara Hulanicki has created looks for Cacharel and Fiorucci, done a collecton of children’s clothes, even designed hotels for Chris Blackwell in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Her current gig? Dreaming up wallpaper for the English company Graham & Brown (grahambrown.com)."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"“Change” is a word we’ve heard too much this year, but Design Miami actually embraced it. The early December showcase housed its 24 dealers in a temporary 43,000-square-foot reusable structure designed by Aranda\Lasch, a smart young architectural firm from New York whose complex, mathematical forms have drawn plenty of attention. The architects reimagined a conventional exhibition tent via an “outer membrane” of translucent vinyl with cutouts to let in light. Ambra Medda, the event’s director, explained that the galleries had outgrown their former space in the Moore Building and that the Aranda\Lasch structure will be transported to other locations. Medda also revealed that when Design Miami opens in Basel next June, it will include dealers in Art Deco and 18th-century furniture. Surprised? It’s not as heretical as it sounds. “I feel like that’s going to empower the show,” Medda said. “It will take a stronger stand and be a little more audacious.” It also provides a hedge against a downturn in the market for contemporary design by offering objects with an established pedigree — as well as, in a welcome development, a broader historical view of design.[?][?][?] PILAR VILADAS."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"More maquette than holiday goodie, this gingerbread version of Farnsworth House — Mies van der Rohe’s modern masterpiece in Plano, Ill. — is a (deep-pocketed) design lover’s dream. It took the elves at April Reed Cake Design several days of photo research and about 25 hours to construct the fondant-covered walls, poured-sugar “glass” windows and sugar-paste I-beams and staircases. The project was a natural progression for the Manhattan cake maven, who specializes in stylishly spare confections for weddings and parties. “I tend to pass on overly theme-y cakes, but I have a soft spot for commissions that are intriguing from a design perspective,” Reed says. The house costs $4,320, with 15 percent of the proceeds going to help repair the real Farnsworth House, which was damaged in a September flood. Go to aprilreed.com.[?][?][?] SANDRA BALLENTINE."

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"For an experimental periodical that has been printed on beer coasters and rubber doorstops, The Thing is aptly named.Founded last year by the Bay Area artists John Herschend and Will Rogan, this quarterly journal takes the form of a text-driven object designed by a different artist each edition and goes out (in a cardboard box) to more than 1,000 subscribers who pay $140 annually. Issue 1 was a cryptically inscribed window blind by Miranda July; Issue 6 (available through Jan. 31; thethingquarterly.com) is a book with blank pages and a shoelace bookmark laced into an actual shoe by Jennifer Allora and Guillermo Calzadilla.[?][?][?] JAIME GROSS."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Artistic reinvention is nothing new, but few explore it as extensively as the Albanian artist Anri Sala. For the American debut of “Anri Sala: Purchase Not by Moonlight,” at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami, Sala has choreographed an ever-changing mix of reverberating drum noises and shifting film projections — from the jazz saxophonist Jemeel Moondoc to truck stops — so that no two visits are exactly alike. Born in Tirana, Albania, and now living in Berlin, Sala, 34, sees himself as the product of “not just political rupture but physical rupture itself.” His show is an exercise in crossed signals, missed connections and the occasionally disorienting intersections between technology, sound and memory, as in the haunting image (right) of a white horse appearing to float on a metal pillar like an undead piece of taxidermy. When it moves on to the Zaha Hadid-designed Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati next May, viewers may discover that the exhibition has been completely overhauled to fit its unconventional new digs. “I’m interested in those gaps where one thing can be seen or heard as something completely different,” Sala says.[?][?][?] LINDA YABLONSKY."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"The usual train-and-veil wedding dress may be fine for the average Bridezilla. But Olivier Bobin, the 30-year-old Parisian designer of the cult bridal line Fade, is aiming for something off the beaten aisle. “We’re supposed to have fun at weddings, so we should celebrate with a mad, cool, funny dress,” says Bobin, whose day job is assisting the D.J. and music producer Michel Gaubert. Bobin’s custom-made, heavily embellished collection (in white, his one nod to tradition) includes such silhouettes as a wide Elizabethan skirt cut above the knee and a puffy shirtdress in oversize lace that he made for the stylist Masha Orlov. After reimagining bridal wear — which takes several weeks to make and costs between $2,500 and $13,000 (societesecrete.org) — Bobin says he’d like to design a special line of clothes for bar mitzvahs and even a range of what he calls “divorce dresses.” “Something dark, maybe a little austere,” he says. “But sexy, and graceful when you walk.” Look for Madonna to place an order.[?][?][?] ALEXANDRA MARSHALL."

And for the holidays, he’s come up with his pièce de résistance: an éclair filled with foie gras cream and glazed with hazelnut icing. Sold individually, they’re ready-made hors d’oeuvres — or just a hotel-room feast. 24-26 Place de la Madeleine; 011-33-1-70-39-38-00. [?][?][?] CHARLOTTE DRUCKMAN."
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"A bed made up to look like a flattened cardboard box – no, it’s not some un-P.C. attempt at satire. Inspired by a trip to New York City, the Dutch designers Peggy van Neer and Erik van Loo created this printed cotton duvet cover (about $78 for a double) and matching pillow cases ($11 each) and named the set Le Clochard, after the French word for “bum.” The duo will donate up to 40 percent of the sales to organizations that will help get youngsters off the streets and back in school. Says van Loo, “It would be a bit strange to reference homelessness on a duvet if you weren’t doing something good with the money.” Up next: linens that mimic pavement.

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Kelley Deal, the lead guitarist and self-proclaimed bad girl of the rock group the Breeders (below), has a new addiction. “I kind of do everything obsessively,” she says. “I smoke obsessively, I took drugs obsessively, and now I knit obsessively.” Her new book, “Bags That Rock” (Lark Books), is part manual, part travelogue, filled with patterns, tips and anecdotes about stitching on the road. (She recommends dyeing yarn with Kool-Aid and soaking purse handles in hotel bathtubs for shape.)

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"Tartan dinner jackets date to a game-changing moment in the 1950s when color (peacock iridescents and “parfait” tones) and pattern (paisley! batik!) were suddenly authorized for dressing up after dark. Think of one of John Cheever’s well-groomed but morally bankrupt characters at a Westchester dinner party, and the look comes drunkenly alive. By 1963 even Amy Vanderbilt had come around, issuing a qualified endorsement — plaid evening jackets were acceptable on cruise ships only — in her “Complete Book of Etiquette.” Two years later Vanderbilt’s rival Elizabeth Post also gave her assent, also with conditions: the style was welcome on “less formal” occasions, and only in summer. Nearly half a century later, tartan dinner jackets are far more identified with the holidays, with doorbells, sleigh bells and clinking cups of wassail. D&G’s fall collection mined the nerdier possibilities of the item to comic effect: the runway models all wore heavy black glasses, batwing bow ties and worried expressions, as if they had second thoughts about their prom dates. Band of Outsiders’s silk plaid jacket with a grosgrain shawl collar has a fan in the Hollywood photographer Paul Jasmin, who wears it on the label’s Web site with a chunky yellow velvet bow tie. The haberdasher Brioni used to be known for its tartan jackets, but when I called the Manhattan store to see if they were still in production, a salesman sounded almost offended. (He referred me to the Las Vegas branch; none there, either.) Ralph Lauren has been loving them since at least 1989, making the jackets a semiregular part of his holiday line; this year’s model, in cashmere, comes in the green-and-navy Black Watch pattern. One advantage of the “Brown Watch” version in Alan Flusser’s New York shop is that you won’t see yourself coming and going. “With gray flannel trousers, a light blue dinner shi"
2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"When Sofia Coppola visited the Louis Vuitton atelier in Asnières, France, she wasn’t planning to redesign its famous handbags. “I had a bag in mind,” she said, “and I couldn’t find it. What I was imagining was chic and classic without tons of hardware and not too show-offy. I didn’t want it too slouchy or too structured and definitely not black — people wear so much black that it’s nice to have a bag that’s a different color.” Since she couldn’t find such a bag, she decided, with Vuitton’s help, to create one; after several prototypes, the SC bag, which combines the utility of a travel duffel with the smaller scale of an everyday bag, was born. Coppola also designed a small envelope clutch that’s perfect for evening and a line of sandals that combine the glamour of the ’40s with the sleek sensibility of the ’70s. Creation is addictive: “I already want a smaller version of my day bag,” Coppola said.[?][?][?] LYNN HIRSCHBERG."

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"ANGEL, for example, revolutionized the aesthetics of perfumery by reinventing the gourmand school. Thierry Mugler told his creative directors he wanted a scent that recalled the sweetness of youth — chocolate, honey, pralines. Shalimar had been there before: it brought the gourmand school into being in 1925 with the molecule ethyl vanillin (which smells like a thousand vanilla milkshakes), but it took Angel’s perfumer, Olivier Cresp, to restore it. He created a high-wire balancing act based on ethyl maltol, the molecule that gives cotton candy its smell. Against these supersweet atoms he set the chewy-almondy molecule coumarin as well as a natural patchouli that cuts the sweet the way ice cuts Grand Marnier. The result is brilliant. Angel is remarkable technically: stable, diffusive, singular. It is also incredibly divisive. But great art often is. Angel changed the state of the art, and molecule for molecule, it is a masterpiece."

The Campanas put their fondness for recycling to work in a landscape of faceted “rocks” made of plastic film over steel frames, and spiky “trees” made of green plastic bottles. The figures of Peter, the wolf and the story’s other characters are made mostly of scrap wood and will be illuminated by Jennifer Tipton’s lighting. George Manahan, the New York City Opera’s music director, will conduct a Juilliard ensemble, and Isaac Mizrahi, who narrated the production last year, had such a good time that he’s coming back for more. If you miss “Peter,” you’ll still be able to see the sets in “Antibodies,” a retrospective exhibition of the Campanas’ work that opens in March at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany.

2008-12-07T00:00:00Z,"I have been ranting about the algorithms that are behind many movie-rating schemes — including Netflix’s — for several years now. It wasn’t “Napoleon Dynamite” that did it for me but the indie smash “Memento” (Clive Thompson, Nov. 23). I hated “Memento,” and it seemed to me that that simple fact, coupled with a few other data points, would allow a computer algorithm to “solve” my movie preferences. Turns out I was wrong. I’m no programmer, but it seems to me that at least two things are wrong with these algorithms. First, they are biased toward positively rated movies more than negatively rated ones; it’s easy to give something three (or even five) stars that you are truly ambivalent about, but much harder to give one or two stars to something you didn’t really dislike. In other words, negative ratings are probably actually more accurate than positive ones. Second, companies that use these algorithms have a pretty big incentive to avoid recommending that their customers avoid certain titles, even though that information would almost certainly be more useful to their customers than the “you’ll probably enjoy” recommendations. Whether the system’s biases are intentional or not, once customers realize that the recommendations are driven by positive ratings, they tend to shy away from giving movies negative ratings. (Or they stop rating movies altogether, as I did.)."

BEHIND THE NEWS The trouble in the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism, stems mainly from a decision five years ago to ordain an openly gay bishop. Some clergy members and churchgoers who opposed the move have affiliated with more conservative bishops in Africa or Latin America, but many wanted a home-grown alternative. The schism threatens the fragile unity of the Anglican Communion, the world's third-largest Christian body."

2008-12-09T00:00:00Z,"BUDOFF--Penny Wise, M.D. Dr. Budoff died in her home in Delray Beach, Florida on December 6th, 2008. Wife, mother, physician, author, medical researcher, Dr. Budoff practiced on Long Island for 33 years. After suffering with rheumatoid arthritis from 1987-2007, she contracted ALS, (Lou Gehrig's disease) which caused her death from respiratory failure. She leaves Sy, her loving husband of 46 years, their son Jeff (a hand and upper extremity surgeon in Houston and editor of five surgical textbooks), his wife and their son and infant daughter. Dr. Budoff is predeceased by her beloved beautiful daughter, Cindy, died June 5, 2007 at 39 from diabetic ketoacidosis. In the 70s, her seminal research to alleviate menstrual pain was published in JAMA and later in the NEJM. Prior to her research, menstrual pain was thought to be a psychological affliction. This breakthrough established a biochemical basis for cramps. It brought instant television appearances in the U.S. as well as lectures in London and South Africa. Her first book was No More Menstrual Cramps and Other Good News (1980). The New York Times on September 16, 1982, called her ''a pioneer in women's health.'' Her second best selling book was ''No More Hot Flashes and Other Good News'' (1983). It cautioned women against radical mastectomy and unnecessary hysterectomies, giving them the detailed medical information they needed to question their doctors and share the decisions that affected their lives. Her first two books started a quiet revolution helping end the paternalism in women's medical care. In 1985, Dr. Budoff founded the first independent women's health center. Employing mostly women doctors, the center became a model for hospitals and other physician groups. It was featured in multiple women's and business magazines, including Time and Business Week. Gynecology, family practice, gastroenterology, cardiology, endocrinology, podiatry, dermatology, breast surgery and radiology were onsite. All doctors shared one chart so that there was no confusion about medications or blood work. Although she was not a surgeon, Dr. Budoff spent much of her time giving second opinions to women who were told they needed a hysterectomy or breast cancer surgery. In the 80s, she advised many of her patients to have a new procedure called a lumpectomy, rather than a radical mastectomy or mastectomy. Because of her expertise about hormones, she successfully treated many women who were told they needed a hysterectomy for bleeding problems, saving them major surgery. In 1982, Dr. Budoff formulated the first vitamins for women. Initially available only to her patients, the vitamins were expanded into a small mail order business named Bonne Forme. Dr. Budoff continued to supervise all product formulations. Her last book was ''No More Hot Flashes and Even More Good News'' (1998)."

2008-12-10T00:00:00Z,"Correction Appended Though a handful of other contenders are already eying his job, Republican National Committee chairman Mike Duncan announced his re-election bid on Wednesday, vowing a return to the party's ''core conservative principles.'' In an e-mail to members of the R.N.C., Mr. Duncan expressed optimism about the future of the party and pledged to roll out a 10-point plan to strengthen it. But in a YouTube video on his Web site, MikeForChairman.com, he acknowledged what may be his biggest liability his leadership of the party during a period of stinging electoral defeats. ''As you can imagine, I share the disappointment of all Republicans around the results of the presidential election,'' he said. But he went on to tout the party's accomplishments in fund-raising (as of November, the R.N.C. had raised more than $320 million) and his efforts to expand its database of supporters (he said the R.N.C. had collected over 10 million e-mail addresses). ''You might remember that for almost two years the pundits were predicting gloom and doom for the Republican Party. They said we wouldn't be able to raise money, they said our base wouldn't be motivated, they said the Republican brand had lost its luster,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''Well I'm here to report that when it comes to the Republican National Committee, they were very wrong.'' Other candidates in the running to unseat Mr. Duncan include, Katon Dawson, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, Saul Anuzis, the chairman of the Michigan G.O.P., Chip Saltsman, who managed Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign, Michael Steele, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, and Ken Blackwell, the former secretary of state of Ohio. The election of the next R.N.C. chairman will take place at the party's winter meeting in late January. And while he still has his job, Mr. Duncan is offering every indication that he will use his bully pulpit to criticize President-elect Barack Obama. Just today he released a statement characterizing Mr.Obama's comments about his contact with Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, who was arrested on allegations of corruption on Tuesday, as ''carefully parsed and vague.'' ''Considering the severity of the allegations against Governor Blagojevich, the President-elect should immediately disclose any and all communications his transition team has had with the governor's office along with any Service Employees International Union officials involved in the matter,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''Obama's promise of transparency to the American people is now being tested.''"

He was born in Paris, France, May 8, 1924 where his father was associated with Munroe & Co., a private bank. His mother, Adelaide Sedgwick, was descended from many early founders of the United States. On his father's side he was descended from both early American stock and persons prominent in the French business community. Partly raised in Paris, he was educated in this country at the Buckley School in New York: St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massa chusetts: and Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was loyal to these institutions as well as Brantwood Camp in Peterborough, New Hampshire, the St. Mark's School camp for those who might not have had a camping experience otherwise, where he served as counselor and for many years as trustee. Entering Harvard in the fall of 1942, he soon like so many of his generation was in the Armed Forces. He ended his military career as a Lieutenant in charge of Gen. Hap Arnold's staff at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Graduating from Harvard in 1949, he taught briefly at St. Mark's School. He lived frequently at Montego Bay in Jamaica where he was an early advocate of its delights, and where he dealt in real estate. He was a raconteur of note, a writer and reciter of a wide variety of limericks, and he enlivened every event to which he went and invariably raised the tone. He was loyal to those he was close to and to the institutions of which he had been part. He is survived by his wife Linda, daughter Adel Edwards of Phoenix, AZ and grandchildren David, Stephen, Deirdra and Christianna.

The Savery work, “Landscape With the Temptation of St. Anthony,” was painted in 1617 and depicts the saint reading in a rustic cell, oblivious to the demons frolicking around him. The Rodin work, probably from around 1898, is a brown wash and graphite drawing titled “Sphinx”; it depicts a naked female figure in what appears to be a desert landscape.

And one of my favorite images from James M. McPherson's new book, ""Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief,"" is Lincoln test-firing new rifles on the White House grounds. Like a lot of autodidacts, he was a restless self-improver, always studying and tinkering. But not all his learning came from books; he also learned from experience and, unlike some more recent occupants of the White House, he was not afraid to change his mind or admit mistakes. As Ed points out, he was, in the beginning at least, antislavery but by no means an abolitionist. Nor did he think that slavery was an issue worth going to war over; it was the union he wanted to defend, and to preserve it he was willing to allow the South to carry on as it had.

2008-12-12T10:49:16Z,"As Ed says, Lincoln was far from perfect, and to me, in my belated journey of rediscovery, that's part of the appeal. Far from the alabaster saint that was presented to us in school, he was endearingly, touchingly human. He was awkward with girls. He loved dirty jokes. Why didn't they tell us that in high school? And even before he got to the White House he carried with him an immense weight of loss and unhappiness: a difficult marriage, the death of his mother, his distant relationship with his father, whose funeral he didn't bother to attend. In this last respect, he reminds me a lot of Samuel Johnson, another awkward, self-created genius who didn't get along with his father and who in later life felt so bad about it that he once visited his father's grave and stood all day there in the rain. In both cases, you feel, these young men -- Lincoln and Johnson -- had to triumph over diminished or uncomprehending parental expectation for them, and the victory came not without psychic cost. But even more than Johnson, Lincoln turned these wounds to advantage. He mastered his temper. (The archives are full of letters he wrote but did not send. Probably just as well he did not live in the age of e-mail.) He learned to get along with his enemies. He so understood human frailty that it made him impassioned about the other, better side of our nature."

2008-12-14T00:00:00Z,"DELSON--Dorothy Haupt, of New York City and Lenox, MA, died December 2, in Palm Beach, FL, in her hundredth year. Beloved mother of Mary D. Silverman of New York City and Amy L. Delson (m. Frank Kaplan) of Atherton, CA; cherished grandmother of Sarah K. Delson (m. Larry D. Kramer) of Stanford, CA, Benjamin Silverman of Los Angeles and Jennifer Kaplan of Chicago; great-grandmother of Veronika Kramer. Dorothy, born September 1, 1909, youngest of four children of Adolph and Mary Haupt, began her century-long journey on the cobblestones of Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn. Her 51-year marriage to fair labor and international lawyer Max Delson, who died in 1988, was a true partnership. She shared his dedication to civil rights and equal justice, values they passed to their children. The couple traveled the world in the course of his work on behalf of developing nations. In 1972, devastated by the early death of their son, Arthur, they found joy in seeing their grandchildren grow and thrive. In widowhood Dorothy maintained an active interest in the social and cultural life of New York City, wintering in Palm Beach and traveling often, including a world cruise in her late 80's. A valued mentor and gracious hostess, she had a gift for making lifelong friends wherever she went, and relished her role as adored grandmother and great-grandmother. Dorothy was an enthusiastic supporter of many causes, especially The Morgan Library. In lieu of flowers, donations to The Morgan at 225 Madison Avenue NY, NY 10016 in her name are suggested. Dorothy Delson was privately interred in Stockbridge, MA."

Her apartment, which is adjacent to the showroom, was being threatened with overspill. ''I envisioned myself living in the park across the street, pointing up to my window and saying, 'That used to be my home,' '' she said. Her new store, several doors down from the showroom, is where all the excess Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dresses, Chloé runway shoes and Narciso Rodriguez shearling coats from seasons past (as well as some current designs) are now relegated, at 70 to 80 percent off their original prices. Called Mina, after her daughter, the store is a dream come true not just for shoppers, but also for Ms. Albright (with her daughter, left). The front of the space functions as an art gallery, a venture Ms. Albright, a former artist, always wanted to undertake. (A show of large-scale paintings by Monica Serra is now on view.) ''The intention was to create a fun environment to display works of art,'' she said, ''whether it's fashion or paintings.''"

There's no real effort involved to get up there. In BASE jumping, you're always involved in bringing your own self up. So it's not just the jump, it's the whole adventure you put together. You see a cliff you're into, you figure out how to get there. Is it a good spot to jump? Is there a good place to land? Can I do this safely? The risks are pretty obvious; BASE jumping is all about stacking the odds in your favor. When you know your own limit and limits of your gear, it can take you amazing places to do amazing things. There's stuff to jump off everywhere. If I go to New York, I'll try to get hooked up with the local jumpers; Germany, same thing. I did Angel Falls in Venezuela. Its a good complement for travel: you get to see all the sights, literally from a different perspective.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

Or a hockey player who devises a novel way to confuse the opposing goalie. Or a dog-poop forensics squad. Or students who figure out the optimal strategy for waiting for the bus. Or the Tokyo construction company that has turned traditional demolition on its head, starting with the bottom floors and working its way upward. Welcome back to the Year in Ideas issue. For the eighth year in a row, we have compiled an alphabetical digest of ideas, from A to Z (almost), that helped make the previous 12 months, for better or worse, what they were. While we have tried to maintain the light and puckish tone of the issue, we have also included a fair number of entries about economics and finance, in acknowledgment of the global crisis, which would benefit from as much thinking as it can get. (We have marked these entries with a dollar-sign light bulb.) We hope you will also enjoy the whimsical creations built and photographed by Vik Muniz (who also did the cover art), as well as the alphabetical lettering, created by Yeohyun Ahn and Ricard Marxer using Caligraft, a software program for ''computational calligraphies.'' And as for next year, who knows? But you can be sure that someone someplace is even now hatching a new idea that will make us scratch our heads in awe.

Ten years ago, she recreated the steel collar in an edition of 39, one of which is on view at ''Zerocarat,'' a show of rare and one-off artist-designed jewelry at the Friedman Benda gallery. There are also coiled earrings by Ron Arad, based on his Hot Ingo lamp; etched pendants by Kiki Smith; a gold necklace by the British pranksters Tim Noble and Sue Webster that spells out an indecency; a sterling silver clutch cast from termite-bored wood by the sculptor Michele Oka Doner; and 20 never-before-seen brass-and-painted-wood pendants made by Louise Nevelson as gifts for friends. Most of the pieces in the show are signed, and they range in price from $1,500 to $24,000. ''It's a nice surprise when you find out an artist you admire for his or her painting or sculpture also made jewelry,'' said Sara Benda, the curator of the show and the founder of Afsoun, an online retailer of such artist-designed jewelry. ''But you also don't have to be an art connoisseur to appreciate them. They're all beautiful, wearable pieces.''"

He was born in Hampton, VA on December 30, 1926 to the late Fenno F. and Dorothy Jones Heath. Professor Heath was the Director of the Yale Glee Club from 1953-1992, a longtime conductor of the Litchfield County Choral Union and of the University Glee Club of New Haven, CT. Widely respected as a composer, teacher and choral conductor, Professor Heath was a mentor to generations of young singers, and was active as a composer, guest lecturer and conductor long into his retirement years. Raised in Hampton, Virginia, he graduated from Newport News High School and attended Loomis School before entering Yale University. His college career was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army during WWII. He graduated from Yale with the Class of 1950 during which he conducted the Apollo Glee Club and sang with the Yale Glee Club, the Spizzwinks and the Whiffenpoofs. At the Yale School of Music he received his Mus.B. in 1951 and Mus.M. in 1952 as a student of Quincy Porter and Paul Hindemith. He remained at Yale to pursue a lifetime in music, eventually becoming the first Marshall Bartholomew Professor of Choral Conducting. Through the many tours he led nationally and worldwide he helped to bring international recognition to the Yale Glee Club. Yale's new Alumni Chorus (YAC) is a direct outgrowth of Mr. Heath's success in creating a life-long love of song in his former singers. Over the years, he has received numerous commissions for choral compositions and has received many awards including the Yale Medal, the Sanford Medal, The Yale Glee Club Medal, the University Glee Club of New York City Medal, the Mory's Cup, and the Vernon Prize for composition. Among his works are the score for the play ''John Brown's Body'', a Mass for Chorus with Brass, and collections of choral arrangements of traditional spirituals. Major works were written for four Presidents of Yale. Texts were chosen by each President and set to music by Fenno Heath. They were sung by the Yale Glee Club at the inaugurations of Presidents Kingman Brewster, A. Bartlett Giamatti, Benno Schmidt and Richard Levin. He is survived by his wife, Carol Quimby Heath of Hamden, CT, his children and extended family: Sarah Heath and Franz Douskey of Hamden, CT, Lucy (Heath) and Robert McLellan of Lebanon, NH, Marguerite Heath Ogilvy and Daniel Hertzler of Windsor, VT, and Fenno F. and Paris (Stamos) Heath III of Woodbridge, CT, and six grandchildren: Heather, Sedgwick and Benjamin Ogilvy, Max Heath, and Quinby and Eliza McLellan. Beecher & Bennett, 2300 Whitney Ave., Hamden, will handle Memorial Services to be announced at a later date. Contributions in memory of Fenno may be sent to the North Congregational Church, P.O.

A longtime resident of Williamsburg, VA, Alvin graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1970, and in 1972, earned his J.D. at the William & Mary Marshall-Wythe School of Law. He practiced law with Anderson, Franck & Davis, P.C. and with Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. Instrumental in establishing Kaufman's Williamsburg office, Alvin served as the Managing Partner until January 2008, and on the firm's Executive Committee. Despite his professional accomplishments, he would frequently remark ''I'm just a country lawyer.'' Alvin's civic commitment inspired all who knew him. Most recently, he sat on the Boards of Riverside Health System, TowneBank, and on the Board of Trustees for Hampton Roads Academy. Alvin served as President of the William & Mary Alumni Society, a member of the MarshallWythe Law School Foundation Board, and on the College's Board of Visitors. In 1998, Alvin received the Alumni Medallion, the highest honor bestowed by the William & Mary Alumni Association. Above all, Alvin was devoted to his family. He met his wife, Betsy, during their freshman year at William & Mary. Married in 1969, they raised their two daughters, Mary Beth Sherwin and Sara Paris Huddleston. Adored and loved by his wife and daughters, he will be terribly missed. Alvin once said: ''I'm proud of two things in life. One is my family and the other is my college. I told someone the other day, this makes me feel like the person my dog thinks I am.'' There never was a finer gentleman. In addition to his wife and daughters, Alvin is survived by his father, brother, sister, mother and father-inlaw, brother-in-law, two sonsin-law, and other family and friends too numerous to count. Memorial gifts may be made to the Alvin Anderson Fund for the William & Mary Alumni House (Checks should be made out to the College of William & Mary Foundation P.O.

''I'll shake it as much as I can,'' she said, a note of disdain in her voice. ''But it still comes out perfect.'' Her photography, which has appeared in French and Italian Vogue and will go on view Monday at the Dactyl Foundation, is decidedly less perfect. ''It's the blurriness and imperfection that I love,'' she explained. ''And that strange feeling that the light can create.'' Shot mainly in Denmark and upstate New York, the landscape images, soft-focus abstractions of light, color and form, have an eerie, ethereal beauty, as if the viewer had witnessed a sublime moment in nature before putting in his or her contact lenses. Some of the photos were in fact taken with an archaic camera phone. ''I'll see something and react to it, and sometimes it's the only thing I have on me,'' Ms. Christensen said, adding that every photo printer hates her. ''They're like, 'What am I going to do with these?' ''"

Avid art collectors, they built a distinctive collection with works by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Hans Hoffman, Archipenko and Andy Warhol. She had a sharp eye for fashion and founded Berenaka, a boutique of one-of-a kind art to wear and was ahead of her time in championing artists who worked in this genre. A passionate and fiery supporter of Israel, Bunny was, in 1994, named Woman of Valor. In 1999, Taffy Gould, philanthropist, honored her by naming the administration building of Alexander Muss High School in Hod Ha'Sharon, Israel, The Bunny Horowitz Administration Building. Bunny adored dance and won awards for ballroom routines. She was a natural hostess. Bunny and Arthur's homes in Florida and Aspen were gathering places where friends, politicians, artists and family were feted with fabulous food, flowers and music which ranged from classical to jazz.

2008-12-14T00:00:00Z,"PERT --Rev. Dr. Florence W. The first woman ordained in the 360-year history of the Collegiate Churches of New York and the first woman to preach from the pulpit of the renowned Marble Collegiate Church, died of cancer on December 9. As Senior Associate Minister Emerita of Marble Collegiate Church since 2002, she continued her involvement in ministerial activities both there and throughout the country until a few months before her death. She was 78. Born in Birmingham, AL, Dr. Pert attended Ward-Belmont School in Nashville, TN (now Harpeth Hall School), and was graduated from BirminghamSouthern College in 1951. Moving to New York in 1953, she was employed by PanAmerican World Airways, where her responsibilities included supervising travel arrangements for UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold. Her decision many years later to apply to seminary was inspired by her deepening involvement in young adult activities at Marble Collegiate Church, whose minister was the internationally known Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. There she met George H. Pert, of Tenafly, New Jersey and they married in 1957. Within a few years she left Pan-Americian to become Director of Leadership Development for Guideposts magazine, and together she and her husband conducted workshops around the country on the dynamics of small groups and lay ministry. The Perts divorced in 1974 but remained friends until his death in 2007. In 1973, Dr. Peale named her Director of Lay Activities at Marble Collegiate Church, where she created a host of activities still in place today, including small groups, adult education, women's groups, and a program for ushers and greeters, and new members. Along with Dr. Pert's preaching, such broad-based congregational involvement has inspired hundreds of laypersons to undertake leadership roles in Marble Church and in churches throughout the country. Upon receiving her M.Div. degree from New York Theological Seminary, she faced the challenge of gaining approval for ordination in a denomination with four centuries of all-male ministry. Widespread support from many quarters reversed this policy, and she was ordained at Marble Collegiate Church in 1987 and named its senior associate minister. Dr. Pert's ministry centered on increasing the role of laity and especially of women. As a board member of the ecumenical ministry Faith@Work, she spearheaded a national effort to foster leadership positions for women in ministry and in lay activities. Through workshops around the country under the auspices of Dr. Peale's School of Practical Christianity, she and others trained hundreds of clergy in spiritual renewal. Honors granted to Dr. Pert included a community service award from the Harlem Interfaith Counseling Service; a BUDDY award from the Legal Defense and Education fund of NOW; citation as Trustee Extraordinaire and Distinguished Alumna of New York Theological Seminary, which also awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Divinity degree in 1998; Distinguished Alumna and Member of the National Advisory Board of Harpeth Hall; and Distinguished Alumna of Birmingham-Southern College. A newly constructed meeting room for the Board of Elders and Deacons of Marble Collegiate Church is to be dedicated to her memory and named in her honor. Dr. Pert is survived by her sister, Dr. Roye E. Wates, of Boston. A memorial service will be held at Marble Collegiate Church, January 10 at 2:00pm, with interment in Birmingham to follow. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent in her name to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York or to a memorial fund to be established in her name at Marble Collegiate Church."

As far as his family was concerned, Judge Lerner died a premature death at the age of 94. His sharp mind, his keen sense of humor, his boundless love of his family, and his unfailing support for President-Elect Barack Obama were with him until he died. Born in Newark, NJ, to Russian immigrant parents, Judge Lerner received a Bachelor's degree from Upsala College and a law degree, with honors, from Rutgers Law School. He went on to become an attorney for the Draft Board in World War II, a Municipal Judge in Newark and Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control, a cabinet position, in the Administration of Governor Brendan Byrne of New Jersey. A renowned civic leader, he rose to be a National Vice President of the Zionist Organization of America, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of Congregation Beth El of the Oranges and Maplewood in South Orange and President of its Men's Club. He also served on the board of The Anti-Defamation League. In 1947 he traveled to Palestine with the ZOA on a mission to secure statehood for Israel. Israel officially became a state in 1948. Judge Lerner with his first wife, Bea, spearheaded many Democratic events, including The Governor's Ball for then candidate John F. Kennedy which attracted nearly 100,000 supporters to the Newark Armory. Noted guests included Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh and Adlai Stevenson. President-Elect Kennedy attributed much of his win in New Jersey, a crucial swing state, to this decisive event. Judge Lerner's first wife, Bea, succumbed to Alzheimer's in 1992. He is survived by his second wife, Joyce; his son, Rabbi Michael Lerner, the activist and Editor of Tikkun in Magazine, who resides in Berkeley, CA with his wife Rabbi Debora Lerner; his daughter, Trish Vradenburg, a TV comedy writer, Playwright and Alzheimer's Activist who resides in Washington, DC with her husband, George Vradenburg, philanthropist and former chief counsel of CBS, FOX, and AOL-Time Warner; three grandchildren and their spouses: Alissa Vradenburg and Michael Sheresky of LA, Akiba and Sunny Lerner of San Francisco and Tyler and Jeannine Vradenburg of Chicago; and five great-grandchildren: Ellie, Jeremiah, Maxine, Gavin, and Harrison.

In fact, I have frequently been overheard to explain to the sort of person who still finds it good sport to ask me how I came to be addicted to alcohol and what it's like now to be stone cold sober: ''You know how you feel at Christmas at the umpteenth family gathering or company cocktail party. You really need that drink, right? That's the way I used to feel all the time.''"

There were no constraints in his mind or actions, nothing that inhibited his enormous energy and creativity, or his appetite for life. He was a creator of ideas, of products, of companies. He inspired others to think out of the box. He was born in Germany on June 16, 1922. He fled the Nazi's and emigrated with his mother to the United States as a young man, bravely serving in the US Army during WW II in key intelligence positions with other German-born soldiers in a unit called The Ritchie Boys. After the war he founded what became the largest merchandising and point-ofsale display company in the world and was responsible for many famous merchandising icons; from Timex watch displays to the Leggs egg.

Based on principles of tolerance and fairness, he devoted much of his energy, resources and passion to fostering a just peace in the Middle East for Jews and for Arabs.

His career was devoted to the study of how information is transferred from one point in space-time to another, with numerous applications in radar, underwater listening devices, satellite technology, and wireless communications. Born April 19, 1920 in New York, he graduated from Deerfield Academy (1938) and Harvard College (1942). During WWII, as a research scientist at Harvard's Radio Research Laboratory, he refined the analysis of aluminum ''chaff'' used to jam enemy radar, protecting American aircraft from detection. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1947. In 1960, he published ''An Introduction to Statistical Communication Theory''. Widely translated and reprinted, it remains the seminal text for the field. For 50 years he taught, inspired and occasionally confounded his graduate and doctoral students at Harvard, RPI, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Texas, Rice, and URI. He was a consultant to various goverment agencies, advisory boards, and served on the U.S. Naval Research Advisory Committee (1970-1977). He was a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society of America, and American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was a member of the Explorers Club, Cosmos Club, and the Dutch Treat Club. Precise in speech, quick with humor, teller of outrageous puns, he was an avid reader of history, philosophy, and biography. Possessing a unique intellect, he had a deep appreciation for the arts expressed in drawing and his un-ending devotion to playing classical piano. The Cape Cod seashore, slamming tennis balls, brisk walks around New York, and popovers at the HC were among his many passions. His first marriage to Nadea Butler ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife of 37 years, Joan; his children, Susan, Leslie, Blake and George Middleton; his step-sons Christopher, Andrew, and Henry Reed; and three granddaughters. He expected a send-off with a full orchestra playing Beethoven and 100 dancing girls, but until that can be arranged, donations in his memory may go to the IEEE History Center (www.ieeefoundation.org)."

2008-12-15T00:00:00Z,"Back in the days when Microsoft was trying to buy Yahoo, Yahoo executives devised a plan to retain employees after a merger or change in control at the company. The plan, which would have given generous benefits to employees fired or reassigned after a merger, quickly became a flash point of controversy. Critics said the broadly worded plan would have allowed just about anyone who was unhappy to leave and claim severance benefits. Microsoft said it would have added hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of buying Yahoo and pointed to the plan as one of the reasons it walked away from its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo."

Pickford, the silent movie star who was a founder of the United Artists studio as well as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, won two Oscars, and her third husband, Buddy Rogers, received an honorary award. The prizes were passed on to Rogers’s heirs, who hoped to sell them to raise money for charity. The academy sued the heirs, citing a rule instituted in the 1950s that forbids the sale of Academy Awards. On Monday, a jury decided that the Rogers heirs were bound by this arrangement. A judge will rule next week on whether the sale of the statuettes can proceed."

Married with three children she moved from the Bronx to Westchester where she worked as a psychiatric social worker and a community activist in the civil rights movement. After moving to Greenwich Village she electrified a New York Radical Feminist Conference on Rape in 1971 with her theory which identified male relatives and family friends as the major sexual abusers of children. When her son, Matthew, contracted AIDS, she formed a mothers' support group. She worked with Women Against Pornography and NOW to oppose exploitation of children in the media. For many years Florence enjoyed a weekly poker game with neighbors and friends who warmly recall her gracious hospitality in New York and Fire Island, and will never forget her original mind, her singular contribution to feminist theory, her impossible platform shoes, and her lasagna. She is survived by her son, Thomas, her daughter, Eleanor, and two grandchildren. A memorial service will be announced at a later date."

Beloved companion of Bonnie Kaye, husband of the late Fay Howard, father of John and Ron Howard and dear grandfather to Eliza, Molly, Ali, Zach and Jackson Howard. Fred's passion for everything made his life anything but ordinary. There were no constraints in his mind or actions, nothing that inhibited his enormous energy and creativity, or his appetite for life. He was a creator of ideas, of products, of companies. He inspired others to think out of the box. He was born in Germany on June 16, 1922. He fled the Nazi's and emigrated with his mother to the United States as a young man, bravely serving in the US Army during WW II in key intelligence positions with other German-born soldiers in a unit called The Ritchie Boys. After the war he founded what became the largest merchandising and point-ofsale display company in the world and was responsible for many famous merchandising icons; from Timex watch displays to the Leggs egg. Fred's devotion to improving Arab-Israeli relations spanned his entire adult life. Based on principles of tolerance and fairness, he devoted much of his energy, resources and passion to fostering a just peace in the Middle East for Jews and for Arabs.

2008-12-16T00:00:00Z,"DULLES--Avery Cardinal, S.J. The New York Province of the Society of Jesus and Fordham University mourn the death of Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., who died on Friday, December 12, 2008, at the age of 90. The Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society, Cardinal Dulles was an internationally renowned author and lecturer on theological topics and the first American to be named a cardinal who was not a bishop. Avery Robert Dulles, S.J., was born on August 24, 1918, in Auburn, NY, the son of Janet Pomeroy Avery and John Foster Dulles, who served as Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1946, and was ordained a priest at the Fordham University Church. That event, which occurred on June 16, 1956, was reported on the front page of The New York Times. Cardinal Dulles came to Fordham in 1988 to take up the McGinley Chair. On February 21, 2001, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Pope Benedict XVI met privately with Cardinal Dulles at St. Joseph's Seminary (Dunwoodie), in Yonkers, NY, on April 19, 2008, during the Pontiff's pastoral visit to the United States. The private audience was a recognition of the Cardinal's intellectual and moral influence as a Jesuit, a theologian and a writer. The Cardinal is survived by the children of his brother, John W. F. Dulles, and sister-in-law, Eleanor Dulles: John Foster Dulles II, Edith Dulles Lawlis, Ellen Coelho and Robert Avery Dulles; nieces Janet Hinshaw-Thomas and Lilly Holt, and nephews Foster Hinshaw and David Hinshaw; cousins Allen Jebsen, Joanna Jebsen Cook, Tina Afokpa, Per Jebsen, Dr. Mary Parke Manning, Thomas Manning, Diane Igleheart and Joan Talley; and by godson Andrew Curry. John W.F. Dulles, the Cardinal's brother, and John Dulles' wife of 68 years, Eleanor Ritter Dulles, both passed away at ages 95 and 91, respectively, in June 2008, in San Antonio, Texas. In accordance with the traditions of the Church, the Cardinal's death will be marked by the celebration of three Masses: Tuesday, December 16, 7:30pm, University Church, Rose Hill Campus, Bronx, NY. Wednesday, December 17, 7:30pm, University Church, Rose Hill Campus, Bronx, NY. Thursday, December 18, 2pm, St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, NY.

2008-12-17T00:00:00Z,"Colorado's political picture might look simple -- historically Republican but trending Democratic in recent elections, notably in supporting President-elect Barack Obama in last month's election. But in appointing someone to replace Senator Ken Salazar, Mr. Obama's choice to be the next secretary of the interior, the Democratic governor, Bill Ritter Jr., will have to wrestle with keeping moderates and independent voters happy to keep the seat in the party's hands. Mr. Salazar, a Democrat with deep roots in the historically Hispanic farming country on the border with New Mexico, was elected to the Senate in 2004 by appealing to rural voters used to supporting Republicans. He replaced Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Republican who chose not to seek a third term. So that would seem to point toward someone in Mr. Salazar and Mr. Ritter's own stamp -- a Democrat who knows the business end of a cowboy boot and can talk credibly about cattle, corn, irrigation and the housing anxieties of the moderate-leaning suburbs."

2008-12-17T00:00:00Z,"As much as they can serve as game changers with their ability to disrupt a passing game, the great pass rushers of the N.F.L. have also been known for inconsistency.

Through 14 games, Ware has 19 sacks, and he has had at least one sack in 13 games. Of the players who have 19 or more sacks since the statistic became official in 1982, only Mark Gastineau of the 1984 Jets had sacks in as many games. In his record-setting 2001 season, Michael Strahan of the Giants had 22 1/2 sacks in 16 games, but had one or more sacks in only 11 games. He had half a sack in two games as well.

There was a gale building behind, a full moon overhead, the deck and rigging were streaked with phosphorescence, and I turned off the instrument lights and drove by feel, with dolphins as outriders making luminous trails through the swells. You can smell land long before you see it. It smells like newly-mown hay, makes you think of all the things you've missed at sea - high on that list, for me, was sex and hooch - and Horta has one of the best bars in the world, Peter's Cafe Sport.Peter's was founded to cater for the crews of 19th century whaling ships. It's provisioned with every alcoholic cordial a thirsty sailor ever dreamed of, open until you finish your drinks, and its veteran clientele ""Glory, Glory, Hallelujah"" when they're in their cups. It's the perfect spot to booze to excess - to exchange toasts with the crews of other boats you last saw in the Caribbean and the best place I ever visited to earn a five-star hangover.When I came to after the binge I had a migraine, blurred vision, liquid bowels, and shakes that started at my fingertips and reached to my elbows."

They can clinch a wild-card berth and the No. 5 seed in the American Football Conference with a victory over the Jaguars, another losing team. The Colts would be even more dangerous if they could get healthy. Running back Joseph Addai and safety Bob Sanders are questionable for this game, and middle linebacker Gary Brackett and receiver Marvin Harrison are out. The last time these teams played, in Week 3, they were both struggling. Jacksonville dominated the game but needed a field goal in the final seconds to win, 23-21. That victory, in retrospect, may be the highlight of the Jaguars' season. Only stopping their A.F.C. South rival from clinching a playoff spot could top it. NAILA-JEAN MEYERS"

Sprizzo died peacefully in his sleep Tuesday morning, December 16, at Roosevelt Hospital, New York City, surrounded by family members and devoted friends. Judge Sprizzo was a fiercely principled and devoutly religious individual. A man of towering intellect, his academic, legal and judicial accomplishments were extraordinary. The many awards which he received from universities and religious and civic organizations attest to the genius of his work. He was a teacher and inspiration to decades of law clerks who had the privilege of serving in his Chambers and later who always returned for the yearly reunions the Judge so thoroughly enjoyed. The Judge's legacy cannot be measured alone by career achievements. Above all, he loved life and lived every minute of it with passion and grace. He was a person of prodigious and diverse tastes. Until health related issues arose, he could always be found on Saturdays at the sixteenth pole at Belmont Race Track and in the evenings resplendent in his tuxedo at the Metropolitan Opera Club--where he could recite every line of virtually any opera without aid of a teleprompter--and then even later in the evenings hosting post-opera parties at P.J. Clarke's. A mountain of a man, one could not help but be captured by his quick wit, infectious smile, hearty laugh and genuine friendship. He was a devoted father, grandfather and brother who loved his family as deeply as he did his Church and its teachings. Like the protagonist in CP Cavafy's Ithaka, John Emilio Sprizzo had a ''marvelous journey'' through life and enriched all those he engaged with the brilliance of his mind and spirit. He was the beloved grandfather of Katie and Nina Bolka and Maria Hatzipetros.

Current measures to keep Mr. Vilar in New York, like a curfew and electronic ankle bracelet, are &#8220;not foolproof,&#8221; the judge said. Mr. Vilar&#8217;s lawyers said they would appeal the order, as well as the conviction. Mr. Vilar, an investment adviser, was a major donor to art institutions before market losses led him, prosecutors asserted, to steal money from his investment clients."

2008-12-20T00:00:00Z,"SNYDER--Harold, 86, of New York City. Generic drug pioneer Harold Snyder died December 18 after a brief illness. Mr. Snyder promoted the widespread use of generic drugs which have improved the lives of millions of people throughout the world. At his death, Mr. Snyder served as a director of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, and as a principal of HBJ Investments. His philanthropy was wide ranging; whether through The Beatrice Snyder Foundation, his many direct gifts, or his participation in organizations large and small. Born on April 25, 1922, Mr. Snyder grew up in NYC, the son of immigrant parents. Despite his enormous success later in life, he never forgot the poverty of his childhood. His caring and generosity touched countless lives around the world; from local charities to medical research, from ecology to music. He was also a passionate promoter of progressive causes. He never regarded any issue as too insignificant to prevent his tireless involvement. Mr. Snyder served in the Army Air Corps on a B-17 bomber during World War II. He graduated from New York University in 1948 and received an M.S. from Columbia University in natural science in 1950. Mr. Snyder was one of the founders of the generic drug industry. In 1964 he formed Biocraft Laboratories in Elmwood Park, NJ with his wife of 49 years, Beatrice. He served Biocraft as President, CEO and Chairman for the next three decades where he worked closely with his entire family. Under his stewardship, Biocraft became one of the largest generic drug manufacturers in the U.S. In 1985, it was the first generic drug manufacturer to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Snyder is survived by his wife, Tamar Hirschl Snyder, an Israeli artist, whom he married in NYC, his daughter, Beryl, and his sons, Brian and Jay, all of NYC, and by six grandchildren, Quentin, Jackson, Maxwell, Ophelia, Brette and Evan. The service will be on Monday, December 22, at 11:45am at The Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76th at Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to The Harold Snyder Charitable Fund, 592 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10036."

On this cheery note a different kind of holiday story opens, featuring a scowling lump of coal. ''Like many people dressed in black, the lump of coal was interested in becoming an artist'' -- or, failing that, at least a charred line on a salmon fillet. It's a far, far better thing that the lump ends up in a naughty boy's stocking, bringing unlikely fame and fortune to the pair, and a fitting conclusion to a hilarious Christmas tale."

And so did the Federal Reserve's moves on Tuesday to strengthen the economy. The Fed cut its benchmark short-term rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent -- essentially as low as it could go. And it pledged to use all the tools at its disposal to restore the battered financial system."

2008-12-21T00:00:00Z,"SNYDER--Harold, 86, of New York City. Generic drug pioneer Harold Snyder died December 18 after a brief illness. Mr. Snyder promoted the widespread use of generic drugs which have improved the lives of millions of people throughout the world. At his death, Mr. Snyder served as a director of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, and as a principal of HBJ Investments. His philanthropy was wide ranging; whether through The Beatrice Snyder Foundation, his many direct gifts, or his participation in organizations large and small. Born on April 25, 1922, Mr. Snyder grew up in NYC, the son of immigrant parents. Despite his enormous success later in life, he never forgot the poverty of his childhood. His caring and generosity touched countless lives around the world; from local charities to medical research, from ecology to music. He was also a passionate promoter of progressive causes. He never regarded any issue as too insignificant to prevent his tireless involvement. Mr. Snyder served in the Army Air Corps on a B-17 bomber during World War II. He graduated from New York University in 1948 and received an M.S. from Columbia University in natural science in 1950. Mr. Snyder was one of the founders of the generic drug industry. In 1964 he formed Biocraft Laboratories in Elmwood Park, NJ with his wife of 49 years, Beatrice. He served Biocraft as President, CEO and Chairman for the next three decades where he worked closely with his entire family. Under his stewardship, Biocraft became one of the largest generic drug manufacturers in the U.S. In 1985, it was the first generic drug manufacturer to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Snyder is survived by his wife, Tamar Hirschl Snyder, an Israeli artist, whom he married in NYC, his daughter, Beryl, and his sons, Brian and Jay, all of NYC, and by six grandchildren, Quentin, Jackson, Maxwell, Ophelia, Brette and Evan. The service will be on Monday, December 22, at 11:45am at The Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76th at Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to The Harold Snyder Charitable Fund, 592 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10036."

But even for employed people with medical coverage, an illness can mean not only a sharp break with the life they have known, but also financial disaster. Employment-based insurance frequently does not sustain someone through the entirety of a serious medical ordeal. Often, a health crisis will ultimately mean the loss of a job, and with it insurance. Medicaid and Social Security disability provide a vital, if minimal, safety net, but qualifying for them can take time, while medical bills pile up, leading to trouble paying the rent, utility bills and other expenses."

This is the city where Zelda Fitzgerald jumped wildly in the fountain in front of the Plaza, the city of ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' written by another fabulous alcoholic, Truman Capote. It's the city of late nights with sloshed celebrities at the Stork Club. It's the city that gave its name to Manhattans and Bronx Cocktails, the city of John O'Hara and Frank O'Hara, of drunken brilliance and brilliant drunks. I don't drink. I know the savage, destructive power of alcoholism. It's a soul stealer. Yet, there's a mischievous part of me that misses all that extreme behavior, all those nasty but somehow amusing surprises, all that glamor even when so much of it ended in pain, institutions and early death. For us sober people there is a kind of drunkenfreude to watching others embarrass themselves, mangle their words and do things they will regret in the morning -- if they even remember them in the morning."

2008-12-21T00:00:00Z,"BAKER--Leon C.,Attorney, Philanthropist. Leon C. Baker, 84, of Boca Raton died after a short illness on November 28, 2008. Lee Baker was born in Brooklyn, NY of immigrant parents. He attended Townsend Harris High School. He briefly attended Brooklyn College, but left to enlist in the Marine Corps after Pearl Harbor. He quickly rose to the rank of 1st Lieutenant and served in the Pacific Theater. After the war, he was stationed in Hawaii. While there, he risked court marshal by insisting to his commanding general that African-American marines not be excluded from educational courses Lee was in charge of organizing. After World War II, Lee attended Harvard Law School. Although he had to work full time to support himself, he was named an editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated second in his class. While at Harvard, he met Gloria Clyman, who became his wife of 60 years. After graduating from Harvard, Lee joined the law firm of Thayer and Gilbert. While there, he assisted clients who were resisting Sen. Joseph McCarthy. At the age of 29 he was named the general counsel of Helene Curtis Industries, the cosmetics company, in Chicago. He remained there until 1962, when he became the general counsel and executive vice president of Revlon. Subsequently, he went into private practice as counsel to the New York City law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. While there, he specialized in the field of mergers and acquisitions. He was also involved in numerous business and real estate ventures. Lee and Gloria moved to Florida in 1984. In 1993, at the age of 70, Lee took the Florida Bar so that he could do pro bono legal work for people who could not afford a lawyer. He and Gloria also became very active in numerous charities, including Jewish Federation, Hadassah, Boca Raton Community Hospital and the Boca Raton Museum of Art. On a personal level, Lee delivered food to the needy for Jewish Family services. Lee was an ardent supporter of the State of Israel. He and Gloria were early supporters of Operation Moses, which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. They also provided funds to bring refugee Jews from the Soviet Union and Argentina to Israel. In addition, they established a tennis complex at Qiryat Shmona in Israel as well as contributing ambulances to the American Red Magen David. They also helped establish the Israel National Blood Center. Lee was an avid supporter of his alma mater, Harvard Law School, where he established scholarships for needy students. A student dormitory, Baker House, was named for him. Lee Baker will be best remembered as a man who unselfishly helped others when he saw people in need. Most often, he did this anonymously. His family will remember that his great passions were his loved ones, lifelong learning, and the law. He is survived by his wife Gloria, his children Robert, James, and Carol, 14 grandchildren, and his brother Edwin H. Baker. In lieu of flowers or food, the family requests that donations be made to Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County, 9901 Donna Klein Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33428."

In a report in The Times last week, Nancy Coyne, chairwoman of the theater advertising agency Serino Coyne, said that the decline in Broadway musicals would lead in the spring to an increase in straight plays, adding: “I think New Yorkers will come out for them once the tourists go away. We’re horrible snobs. We hate tourists from Cleveland.” Though the remark elicited the anger of some Clevelanders, it has also earned them free theater tickets: the musical “Chicago” will give one free ticket to any Cleveland resident (with government-issued photo ID) who comes to a Monday, Tuesday or Thursday evening performance in January. The Plain Dealer reported that Ms. Coyne would appear on Cleveland radio stations in January and February to give away tickets to other Broadway shows."

Now a medical study conducted by an Australian scientist suggests that the heavy-metal practice of headbanging to fast music can cause head and neck injuries, The Guardian reported. In a study published in The British Medical Journal, Andrew McIntosh, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales’s School of Risk and Safety Sciences, writes that flailing along to a headbanging song (with an average tempo of 146 beats per minute) can cause “mild head injury when the range of motion is greater than 75 degrees”; at faster tempos the risks can range from headaches to strokes. The study concludes that listeners can reduce the risk of injury by wearing protective gear, headbanging to every other beat or “replacing heavy metal with adult oriented rock.”"

The Head of Amenhotep III, a sculpture that dates to the 14th century BC, was smuggled out of Egypt in 1990 by Jonathan Tokeley-Parry, a restorer of antiques who covered the head in liquid plastic to disguise it as a souvenir. In 1997 Mr. Tokeley-Parry was convicted of trading in stolen antiquities and jailed for three years. The head was recovered in 1999 by the art and antiques division of London’s Metropolitan Police, but its rightful ownership took several years to determine.

2008-12-22T00:00:00Z,"SNYDER--Harold, 86, of New York City. Generic drug pioneer Harold Snyder died December 18 after a brief illness. Mr. Snyder promoted the widespread use of generic drugs which have improved the lives of millions of people throughout the world. At his death, Mr. Snyder served as a director of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the world's largest generic pharmaceutical company, and as a principal of HBJ Investments. His philanthropy was wide ranging; whether through The Beatrice Snyder Foundation, his many direct gifts, or his participation in organizations large and small. Born on April 25, 1922, Mr. Snyder grew up in NYC, the son of immigrant parents. Despite his enormous success later in life, he never forgot the poverty of his childhood. His caring and generosity touched countless lives around the world; from local charities to medical research, from ecology to music. He was also a passionate promoter of progressive causes. He never regarded any issue as too insignificant to prevent his tireless involvement. Mr. Snyder served in the Army Air Corps on a B-17 bomber during World War II. He graduated from New York University in 1948 and received an M.S. from Columbia University in natural science in 1950. Mr. Snyder was one of the founders of the generic drug industry. In 1964 he formed Biocraft Laboratories in Elmwood Park, NJ with his wife of 49 years, Beatrice. He served Biocraft as President, CEO and Chairman for the next three decades where he worked closely with his entire family. Under his stewardship, Biocraft became one of the largest generic drug manufacturers in the U.S. In 1985, it was the first generic drug manufacturer to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Snyder is survived by his wife, Tamar Hirschl Snyder, an Israeli artist, whom he married in NYC, his daughter, Beryl, and his sons, Brian and Jay, all of NYC, and by six grandchildren, Quentin, Jackson, Maxwell, Ophelia, Brette and Evan. The service will be on Monday, December 22, at 11:45am at The Riverside Memorial Chapel, West 76th at Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to The Harold Snyder Charitable Fund, 592 Fifth Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10036."

2008-12-22T00:00:00Z,"A.F.C. A year ago, H. Wayne Huizenga, the MIAMI DOLPHINS owner, wept that his team had won only one game. He's going to be a blubbering mess if the Dolphins, who beat the Chiefs on Sunday, beat the Jets next week because that will make them A.F.C. East champions. It could be revenge for Chad Pennington, dealt from the Jets to make room for Brett Favre. Next up: Jets. The JETS have done everything possible to miss the playoffs. Their loss Sunday means they have to beat Miami and hope that New England loses to Buffalo so they can win the division. If New England wins, the Jets would make it as the wild card if they beat the Dolphins and the Ravens lose. Next up: Miami. Something simple: the BALTIMORE RAVENS, who beat the Cowboys on Saturday night, would clinch the A.F.C.'s final wild-card spot with a victory at home. Next up: Jacksonville. If this were the Bowl Championship Series, the NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS would earn style points for how they mauled the Arizona Cardinals, then got a huge boost from their nemesis, the Jets. If the Jets beat the Dolphins, and the Patriots win, the Patriots would win the division. If the Ravens lose, and the Dolphins win, the Patriots are in as a wild card with a victory. But if the Dolphins win and the Ravens win, the Patriots would be shut out, no matter what they do. Next up: Buffalo. You better believe the official Ed Hochuli will not be on the field when the DENVER BRONCOS and the SAN DIEGO CHARGERS meet in a winner-take-all game for the A.F.C. West championship. Denver won the first meeting in Week 2 on the famously botched fumble/incompletion call by Hochuli. Denver has squandered a three-game lead with three to play. Next up: Chargers. The TENNESSEE TITANS clinched home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. playoffs by beating the Steelers, 31-14. The PITTSBURGH STEELERS are the No. 2 seed. The INDIANAPOLIS COLTS clinched a wild-card spot with their victory over Jacksonville on Thursday. N.F.C. The MINNESOTA VIKINGS wasted an opportunity to clinch the N.F.C. North with a loss to the Falcons, but that at least gives meaning to Monday night's game between the Packers and the Bears. Minnesota would win the division with a victory next week or a Chicago loss Monday night. Next up: Giants. Despite a loss to the Ravens on Saturday, the DALLAS COWBOYS are in as a wild card with a victory next week at Philadelphia. It is the first time Norv Turner has helped the Cowboys since he was coaching Troy Aikman -- the Chargers' victory over the Buccaneers on Sunday gave the Cowboys a huge break. Next up: Philadelphia. The TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS lost their third straight and now not only need to win next week, but also need Philadelphia to beat Dallas. Next up: Oakland. Despite their loss to the Redskins, the PHILADELPHIA EAGLES are not quite out yet. They have to win, and Tampa Bay and Chicago have to lose. Next up: Dallas. The CHICAGO BEARS are also still barely alive, but need a ton of help. First, they must win Monday. Next up: Green Bay. Wonder if Michael Vick was watching when the ATLANTA FALCONS clinched at least a wild-card spot with their victory over Minnesota and Tampa Bay's loss to San Diego. Next up: St. Louis. The GIANTS secured home-field advantage throughout the N.F.C. playoffs with their victory over the CAROLINA PANTHERS, who have clinched a playoff berth but still need a victory or an Atlanta loss to win the N.F.C. South."

And at Staatsoper, he will be replacing Peter Mussbach, who has frequently feuded with its musical director, Daniel Barenboim.

In February, Mr. Spears was granted temporary control of his daughter after Ms. Spears, 27, was placed under psychiatric evaluation. That conservatorship was made permanent in October, though Ms. Spears can petition to have it removed. Earlier this month, Ms. Spears’s album “Circus” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart."

Once I got over that jolt, I started paying attention to how smoothly and effortlessly he made it look -- sort of like one of his boyhood idols, Cal Ripken Jr. His footwork was textbook, and so was his glovework.

Lewis’s enchanted wardrobe a little more bare: the company said it would not help finance and produce the next movie in the “Chronicles of Narnia” series, based on Lewis’s fantasy novels, The Hollywood Reporter said. The franchise, jointly produced and financed by Disney and Walden Media, had a hit with its first entry, “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” which was released in 2005 and grossed $745 million worldwide. But a sequel, “Prince Caspian,” released in May, grossed $419 million. Disney had an option to take part in a third movie, “The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” which it chose not to exercise. “Dawn Treader” is in preproduction for a 2010 release."

On Tuesday, a judge denied the Lifetime channel’s request to consolidate the various lawsuits in federal court, Variety said. The suits stem from a decision by the Weinstein Company, which produces “Project Runway,” to move the show from Bravo to Lifetime. NBC Universal, the parent company of Bravo, has sued the Weinstein Company, which has sued Bravo, and Lifetime sued them all, saying that the channel had exclusive rights to the show. In New York, District Court Judge Richard J. Sullivan did not rule on the ownership of “Project Runway” but rejected the consolidation request.

Prince Charles-Emmanuel de Bourbon-Parme has asked an administrative court at Versailles to halt the exhibition, called “Jeff Koons Versailles,” which juxtaposes an encased display of vacuum cleaners and a giant balloon dog with the palace’s portraits of French royalty, and includes a bare-breasted woman holding a pink panther, among other works. In his complaint, the prince called the show “a desecration and an attack on the respect due to the dead,” according to Agence-France Presse.

In the suit, Warner Brothers said that the network had refused to pay additional fees the studio said it was owed if the show achieved certain ratings numbers in its fourth season, which aired from 2006 to 2007. That season, “Two and a Half Men” was ranked 19th in the ratings; in its current season it is frequently a Top 10 show, and often the only sitcom to reach such heights."

Celebrating America's Greatest Holiday,"" demonstrates that Christmas has always been a dynamic holiday, constantly evolving, and that many of our most familiar rituals and much of our most ubiquitous iconography are of relatively recent vintage. Christmas trees, for example, didn't really catch on until the 1930s. In the first decade of the 20th century, only one family in four had a tree, and Theodore Roosevelt allowed one into the White House only after he was persuaded that cutting down small trees was good for conservation. The first national tree dates from 1923."

And his plans for a great Hollywood novel, ""The Last Tycoon,"" were foiled by his death in 1940."

2008-12-24T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Edmund Nelson II, died peacefully at home Friday morning, December 19th, surrounded by his immediate family. He was a war hero, an attorney, a statesman, and a lover of history and literature; he was an adoring and uniquely adored husband, father, grandfather, and friend. His life was devoted to country, the Law, social justice and-above all-family. Among innumerable other achievements, he was awarded a Bronze Star in World War II for successful covert missions flown in Dien Bien Phu, formerly French Indo-China. Working in military intelligence, he was a member of the small team that rescued the celebrated Doolittle Raiders who had been trapped behind enemy lines following Pearl Harbor. He was proud of his service, and loved returning to Asia to re-visit places he had been. Throughout his life he held myriad leadership positions in the worlds of Delaware and American law: as Deputy Attorney General for the State of Delaware; as Special Deputy Attorney General for the State of Delaware; as Chairman of numerous advisory committees for the Delaware Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; as President of the Delaware Bar Association; and, later, President of the American Judicature Society, which presented him with their Justice Award. He was honored to be a Director, and later President, of Delaware law firm Richards, Layton and Finger, where his community of colleagues was like a second family. After retiring, he worked tirelessly pro bono on various legislative reforms; in 2000, he co-founded Stand Up for what is Right and Just (SURJ), where-alongside former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh-he created a new movement for local legislative reform. He served as Trustee or Trustee Emeritus for many organizations, including Princeton University, where he worked with his fellow trustees during the University's transition to coeducation. He always maintained that the school's motto, dei sub numine viget, actually meant, God went to Princeton. Throughout his life he always found time to be an influential, often anonymous, philanthropist (a word he never would have used in describing himself) through his leadership of a private family foundation. He wrote hundreds of Letters to the Editor of the Wilmington News Journal through the years, arguing for those things he believed in most passionately, perhaps above all the repeal of the Rockefeller-era drug laws that provided for mandatory minimum sentencing. He also held out hope for the decriminalization of drugs (a last Letter to the Editor on this subject was published one week before he died). He loved and found great comfort in literature, and in poetry in particular, and was uniquely drawn to Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses; he loved the lines that read: ''To follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of human thought . . . to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'' He had unique charm and profound humility, and he wielded his infamous wit with subtlety and precision. He loved athletics and opera. He was deeply proud to be an American. As a close friend of the family put it recently, he was the closest thing most of us will ever get to knowing James Bond. He is survived by the love of his life, his wife, Carroll Morgan Carpenter; six loving children, Mary Wootten Carpenter, Jeff Carpenter, Katherine Revell Reynolds Carpenter, John Davis Gates Jr., Ashley Gates Jansen, Lea du Pont Carpenter Brokaw, and their spouses; and thirteen loving and loved grandchildren. The family wishes to thank: Drs. Patricia Curtin, M.D., Stephen DeCherney, M.D., Kathleen McNicholas, M.D., Lanny Edelsohn, M.D., Gerald M. Lemole, M.D., Lee S. Cohen, M.D, and Phil Blatt, MD. They also wish to thank especially Elizabeth Lea Carpenter du Pont, Mr. Carpenter's beloved niece who introduced him to his wife, and after whom his youngest daughter was named. A private memorial service was held for immediate family in their home in Wilmington on Saturday, December 20th. Please contact Hardin & Associates at 302-654-9923 for information regarding the memorial service or email information@hardininc.com. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent to Princeton University or to Christiana Care Health System of Delaware."

2008-12-25T00:00:00Z,"EVEN a cursory look at the plentitude of wooden, weathered and functionally forgotten snowshoes that often hang crisscrossed above ski lodge fireplaces will reveal a simple truth: not every one of those bentwood and rawhide-laced contraptions were made for the same purpose. Seven-foot-long Athapaskans were used in open spaces where abrupt changes in direction were infrequent; two-foot-long Ojibwas were for speedy jaunts through changing terrain. Compared with the highly technical snowshoes of today, such a drastic variation in shape and size may seem surreal. But a similar, albeit more nuanced, observation is applicable to today's shoes when it comes to functionality. Though size varies less, there is now a snowshoe for all but the most extreme of snowy traverses: packed trails, backcountry climbs, even lake walks."

Mr. Halling, a classically trained violinist, said that he would lose thousands of dollars a year in income when songs by the Beatles, Tom Jones and the Moody Blues fall into the public domain. “I feel it is unfair that it should just be finished,” Mr. Halling said, according to Bloomberg. Under current European Union law, contributing musicians receive royalties from songs for 50 years; the British government is considering supporting an extension of that period to 75 years. The European Parliament will debate a possible extension in 2009."

The planned five-city tour of Canada, in which the company was to perform a ballet version of “A Streetcar Named Desire” choreographed by its artistic director, John Alleyne, was scheduled for April. But Graeme Barrit, the president of the ballet, said, “We just can’t afford it,” according to the CBC. In November, Mr. Alleyne and the company’s dancers were laid off by the struggling ballet, which had already committed to its production of “The Nutcracker” featuring the Moscow Classical Ballet. Those shows were able to go on, but the ballet said it still needed about $165,000 to rehire Mr. Alleyne and its dancers."

Warner Brothers has said that the show was still running at a deficit through its first six seasons. Mr. Polone’s company, Hofflund/Polone, says that Warner Brothers and the WB network have come up “with a scheme that rivals the greed and bravado of any story line defendants could script,” according to The Hollywood Reporter."

I will put in the comment part below my own response to Bob - who agreed to allow me to post his email - and invite readers to give their opinions on some of his interesting ideas:"
2008-12-26T23:42:04Z,"Chess is not simple, but it can seem uncomplicated compared with the issues swirling around the governance of the game. Recently, there have been problems relating to the staging of a Grand Prix series to select a challenger for the world championship and an incident at which a top player failed to take a drug test, violating rules of the World Chess Federation that some top players feel are unnecessary."
2008-12-26T23:05:45Z,"Both of these teams had visions of a B.C.S. bowl appearance at one point this season. But that was before both stumbled at season's end. North Carolina lost two of its last three and West Virginia two of its last four. The Tar Heels are in a bowl game for the first time since 2004, but they also have wins against the Big East teams Rutgers and Connecticut this year. Could the Mountaineers be the third team from the conference to lose to Butch Davis's squad? Meanwhile, West Virginia is in its seventh consecutive bowl game, a run that includes last year's surprisingly decisive victory over Oklahoma, a win that secured the coaching job for Bill Stewart."
2008-12-26T22:57:02Z,"The question coming into this one is whether Miami is going to be able to stop Cal's Jahvid Best, who is one of the better running backs in college football. Miami was making a surprising run at the A.C.C. title until it got absolutely torched by Georgia Tech, giving up over 400 yards on a nationally televised Thursday night game. The Hurricanes followed that up with a stinker against North Carolina State in which they gave up over 200 yards on the ground. Cal loves to run the ball, with Best coming off a team-record 311 yards and 4 touchdowns in a blowout victory over Washington. This one is going to be played in the Bay Area, which is a huge plus for the Bears and is a long trip for the Hurricanes. At the end of the day this is an intriguing meeting between two teams that haven't played each other since 1990 and is a good Saturday night game on the weekend between Christmas and New Year's. Nothing wrong with that."
2008-12-26T22:03:29Z,"Locking up unauthorized immigrants for deportation is a growth industry. The jail in Central Falls, R.I., tried to cash in, but in a town full of immigrants, one result is a community living in fear."
2008-12-26T22:00:41Z,The key to solving many Saturday crosswords is to crack a few relatively easy three-letter answers and build up gradually from there.
2008-12-26T21:57:19Z,"I've got to be honest. This is very tough for me, but I need to get this off my chest: Fred Bierman picked Wisconsin to play in a B.C.S. game. This is true. He did this on his own, without taking any input from an outside source (such as myself). From such great expectations came a grand stumble to mediocrity, as the Badgers needed a three-game winning streak (including an overtime win over Cal Poly of the F.C.S.) to secure their seventh consecutive bowl appearance. Similarly, Florida State continued its recent malaise with an up-and-down 8-4 season. While an improvement over back-to-back 7-6 finishes, these aren't your father's Seminoles. Let's see which team brings its best effort to a bowl neither expected to attend."
2008-12-26T21:06:36Z,"Columbia Ballet Collaborative was started by a group of ballet dancers who wanted to run and dance in their own company -- a common path for modern dancers, but not ballerinas."
2008-12-26T21:00:07Z,"SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, a month after having hip replacement surgery and less than a week after his 82nd birthday, was the picture of health and good humor Friday as Penn State and Southern California visited Disneyland as part of their Rose Bowl festivities."
2008-12-26T19:59:17Z,"HONOLULU - In the news-free zone that is Barack Obama's pre-inaugural Hawaiian vacation, this passes for a bulletin: The president-elect ditched his ""press pool"" of media minders to take his daughters to a water park on Friday morning."
2008-12-26T19:44:50Z,"The Russian K.H.L. returned to full-scale action on Friday with a humongous showdown in suburban Moscow between the No. 1 and 2 teams, Salavat Yulaev Ufa and Atlant Mytishchi. Atlant had won the two previous meetings this year, and if they beat the visitors from Bashkortostan again they'd take over first place. But instead, Salavat proved their mettle with a wild finish:"

Resilient beyond all reasonable measure, Mr. Berry is 82 and not at all worried about it. His hits ''Johnny B. Goode'' and ''Maybellene'' helped form the bedrock of modern rock 'n' roll, and in his performances he doesn't stray far from those reliables."

But Jim James and his band keep wandering elsewhere: toward both reggae and Britpop-flavored, keyboard-centered songs on the album ''Z,'' and into funk on this year's ''Evil Urges'' (ATO). Old or new, My Morning Jacket's ringing, expansive songs are at home in big open spaces."
2008-12-26T00:00:00Z,"YOU'RE skiing slowly on an intermediate trail and you suddenly slip. You're not out of control -- you weren't going that fast -- but you are off balance. One arm flails behind your head as you teeter and twist backward until your hips awkwardly sit down on the tails of your skis. Then you hear a loud pop in your knee. You probably have just torn the anterior cruciate ligament, which in the last 20 years has become the most common serious injury in skiing, dwarfing the number of broken legs. You face major reconstructive surgery and at least six months of grueling rehabilitation."
2008-12-26T00:00:00Z,"THERE'S a school of thought that everyone should ring in the New Year at least once in Times Square. Indeed, the experience can be both breathtaking and unifying. It's cold, and many of the people in the crowd are extremely inebriated, but you become part of something bigger, much as 2,668 Waterford crystals combine to form the glittering countdown ball. One thing this Big Event is not, however, is child-friendly. Sure, there are a few children sprinkled here and there in the crowd, but Times Square -- at least on New Year's Eve -- isn't exactly child's play. Thankfully, there are plenty of other options for parents who aren't ready to confine their families to house parties or pay exorbitant babysitting fees, especially since many destinations and resorts now cater to the under-12 set."

Reis, Diane Reis and Pamela Reis, devoted brother of Hilda Bijur, and former business leader in menswear manufacturing, died peacefully on December 23rd in his home in Manhattan from multiple illnesses. A lifelong New Yorker, born in 1916, he graduated from Deerfield Academy and Princeton University, for which he became a prodigious fundraiser, winning awards annually for his loyal service to the university he loved. In 2007, he was awarded Princeton's highest honor for service, the Harold Helm Distinguished Service Award for exemplary and sustained service to the University. After becoming the youngest executive at Pan American Airways, he joined the military in World War II, rising to the rank of captain in the Air Transport Command and received a medal for outstanding performance. For 32 years he served as president of Robert Reis & Co., a family apparel business started by his grandfather in 1885 and run by his father until 1947. As a result of his experience atop a company at age 31, he co-founded the Young Presidents' Organization, a group of business presidents under age 39 dedicated to developing modern management methods. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce and was appointed by New York Governor Dewey in 1954 to the Committee on the Refugee Relief Act to coordinate placing refugees in New York State. After ending his career in manufacturing in 1978, he became a licensed real estate broker for Albert Ashforth, Inc. He served for decades as president of the board of his New York cooperative apartment building. He was married to his cherished wife Muriel Henle Reis for 55 years until her death in 2008. He was loved by his grandchildren, Chloe Hyman, Mara McCartin, Elisa McCartin and Lucas Hyman, his daughter-and sons-in-law Marianne Reis, Joseph McCartin and Kevin Hyman, his nieces and nephews, Vicky Bijur, Arthur Bijur, Fred Vogel and Carol Vogel. A loving and generous family member, a deeply loyal friend and a devoted contributor to his community, he will be deeply missed by all who knew him.

But hotel rooms are few, tourist amenities scarce and developers actively discouraged. Molokai stands apart from all things commercial, existing on its own terms. Yet for those of us who live on these islands and remember an older Hawaii -- magical, sensuous, isolated -- or for those who want to find some sense of how things were on Maui, the Big Island and Kauai before those islands were drawn into the hustle and flow of Oahu, Molokai is more than worth the trouble. Its lifestyle is more traditionally Polynesian, its people reserved but, when their veneer is cracked, warm and full of an ancient joie de vivre."

Rosenblum and Col. Abraham J. Rosenblum. He attended The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina; New York University and received an MBA from Columbia University. He left The Citadel in 1943 to volunteer to serve in North Africa during WWII, rather than wait for his commission. Following the War he returned to the US, where he completed his education, received his MBA and married Judith Raumann in 1953. As an officer in the Reserves, he continued his connection with the military, ultimately being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retired from the military in 1961, but was referred to as ''The Colonel'' by his friends and neighbors in the Five Towns, Long Island for most of his life. He owned and ran an independent insurance brokerage in Manhattan, but still found time for a wide range of community activities. He was Commodore of the Woodmere Bay Yacht Club in East Rockaway, NY; he was an active participant at Temple Sinai, in Cedarhurst, NY, where he served as President of the Men's Club and where he relished his acting roles in the community theatre group; he taught at The State University of NY at Farmingdale and at Pace College in Manhattan. Leaving Cedarhurst in the 1980s, he moved to Manhattan and divided his time between New York, Westhampton Beach and Key Biscayne, Florida; to which he retired in 2003. Ever the avid military man, he started every morning of his life with the same rigid exercise regimen that has been inculcated into him in The Citadel at age 17. An avid reader, he was incredibly strong, and he fought to the very end, a product of a longtime of military bearing. he is survived by his wife of 55 years, Judith Rosenblum (Zador); his daughter Amy Rosenblum and son-in-law Ted Savaglio; his son Michael Rosenblum and his wife Lisa; and two grandchildren, Adam and Brett Savaglio; his brother Lt.

But after McNabb hit rock bottom on Nov. 23, the Eagles (9-6-1, wild card) have gone 4-1 to surge into the playoffs. They will encounter Reid's former offensive coordinator, Brad Childress, whose Vikings (10-6, N.F.C. North champion) bear striking similarities to the Eagles. The Vikings pass rusher Jared Allen will give the Eagles' protection headaches all day. But McNabb's mobility makes him far better equipped to anticipate and escape pressure than the inexperienced Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson is to handle the Eagles' blitz-happy defense. As much attention as will be paid to the quarterbacks, both offenses rely heavily on their running backs -- the Vikings on Adrian Peterson, the Eagles on the all-around threat Brian Westbrook."

Today’s crises demand new visions of an economy based on creating livelihoods while living within the limits of our planet. Ecological economists like Herman Daly and others offer a vision of a steady state economy that uses resources at the rate that the earth can replace them. Keynes has had his day."

A lifelong New Yorker, born in 1916, he graduated from Deerfield Academy and Princeton University, for which he became a prodigious fundraiser, winning awards annually for his loyal service to the university he loved. In 2007, he was awarded Princeton's highest honor for service, the Harold Helm Distinguished Service Award for exemplary and sustained service to the University.

He was a member of the Executive Committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce and was appointed by New York Governor Dewey in 1954 to the Committee on the Refugee Relief Act to coordinate placing refugees in New York State. After ending his career in manufacturing in 1978, he became a licensed real estate broker for Albert Ashforth, Inc. He served for decades as president of the board of his New York cooperative apartment building. He was married to his cherished wife Muriel Henle Reis for 55 years until her death in 2008. He was loved by his grandchildren, Chloe Hyman, Mara McCartin, Elisa McCartin and Lucas Hyman, his daughter-and sons-in-law Marianne Reis, Joseph McCartin and Kevin Hyman, his nieces and nephews, Vicky Bijur, Arthur Bijur, Fred Vogel and Carol Vogel.

Forget the sequins and five-inch stilettos. Right now, downing Champagne in a snuggly romper sounds like the best idea around. Of course, Alexander Wang didn't have that image in mind when he designed this one-piece for his resort collection. He imagined a girl hanging out in it on a motorboat, then pulling on a black blazer, platform boots and a captain's hat to hit town.

Rosenblum and Col. Abraham J. Rosenblum. He attended The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina; New York University and received an MBA from Columbia University. He left The Citadel in 1943 to volunteer to serve in North Africa during WWII, rather than wait for his commission. Following the War he returned to the US, where he completed his education, received his MBA and married Judith Raumann in 1953. As an officer in the Reserves, he continued his connection with the military, ultimately being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retired from the military in 1961, but was referred to as ''The Colonel'' by his friends and neighbors in the Five Towns, Long Island for most of his life. He owned and ran an independent insurance brokerage in Manhattan, but still found time for a wide range of community activities. He was Commodore of the Woodmere Bay Yacht Club in East Rockaway, NY; he was an active participant at Temple Sinai, in Cedarhurst, NY, where he served as President of the Men's Club and where he relished his acting roles in the community theatre group; he taught at The State University of NY at Farmingdale and at Pace College in Manhattan. Leaving Cedarhurst in the 1980s, he moved to Manhattan and divided his time between New York, Westhampton Beach and Key Biscayne, Florida; to which he retired in 2003. Ever the avid military man, he started every morning of his life with the same rigid exercise regimen that has been inculcated into him in The Citadel at age 17. An avid reader, he was incredibly strong, and he fought to the very end, a product of a longtime of military bearing. he is survived by his wife of 55 years, Judith Rosenblum (Zador); his daughter Amy Rosenblum and son-in-law Ted Savaglio; his son Michael Rosenblum and his wife Lisa; and two grandchildren, Adam and Brett Savaglio; his brother Lt. General Donald E. Rosenblum and Nancy of Savannah, Georgia, Sister-inlaw Betty Piccoli, Milan, Italy and nine nieces and nephews.

Officially, he is not injured, but he again said he had not undergone any tests. And if Joey Porter and the Dolphins' pass rush can get to him, Favre's throwing could deteriorate as the game wears on. Porter ranks second in the league with 17.5 sacks this season, behind only the Dallas Cowboys' DeMarcus Ware, and the Jets' offensive line has allowed Favre to be sacked 30 times this season, putting him in a tie for 22nd in the league. That is why the offensive coordinator Bryan Schottenheimer said that the only way to deal with Porter was by an all-points bulletin to his blockers."

2008-12-28T00:00:00Z,"CARPENTER--Edmund Nelson II, died peacefully at home Friday morning, December 19th, surrounded by his immediate family. He was a war hero, an attorney, a statesman, and a lover of history and literature; he was an adoring and uniquely adored husband, father, grandfather, and friend. His life was devoted to country, the Law, social justice and-above all-family. Among innumerable other achievements, he was awarded a Bronze Star in World War II for successful covert missions flown in Dien Bien Phu, formerly French Indo-China. Working in military intelligence, he was a member of the small team that rescued the celebrated Doolittle Raiders who had been trapped behind enemy lines following Pearl Harbor. He was proud of his service, and loved returning to Asia to re-visit places he had been. Throughout his life he held myriad leadership positions in the worlds of Delaware and American law: as Deputy Attorney General for the State of Delaware; as Special Deputy Attorney General for the State of Delaware; as Chairman of numerous advisory committees for the Delaware Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; as President of the Delaware Bar Association; and, later, President of the American Judicature Society, which presented him with their Justice Award. He was honored to be a Director, and later President, of Delaware law firm Richards, Layton and Finger, where his community of colleagues was like a second family. After retiring, he worked tirelessly pro bono on various legislative reforms; in 2000, he co-founded Stand Up for what is Right and Just (SURJ), where-alongside former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh-he created a new movement for local legislative reform. He served as Trustee or Trustee Emeritus for many organizations, including Princeton University, where he worked with his fellow trustees during the University's transition to coeducation. He always maintained that the school's motto, dei sub numine viget, actually meant, God went to Princeton. Throughout his life he always found time to be an influential, often anonymous, philanthropist (a word he never would have used in describing himself) through his leadership of a private family foundation. He wrote hundreds of Letters to the Editor of the Wilmington News Journal through the years, arguing for those things he believed in most passionately, perhaps above all the repeal of the Rockefeller-era drug laws that provided for mandatory minimum sentencing. He also held out hope for the decriminalization of drugs (a last Letter to the Editor on this subject was published one week before he died). He loved and found great comfort in literature, and in poetry in particular, and was uniquely drawn to Alfred Tennyson's Ulysses; he loved the lines that read: ''To follow knowledge like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of human thought . . . to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'' He had unique charm and profound humility, and he wielded his infamous wit with subtlety and precision. He loved athletics and opera. He was deeply proud to be an American. As a close friend of the family put it recently, he was the closest thing most of us will ever get to knowing James Bond. He is survived by the love of his life, his wife, Carroll Morgan Carpenter; six loving children, Mary Wootten Carpenter, Jeff Carpenter, Katherine Revell Reynolds Carpenter, John Davis Gates Jr., Ashley Gates Jansen, Lea du Pont Carpenter Brokaw, and their spouses; and thirteen loving and loved grandchildren. The family wishes to thank: Drs. Patricia Curtin, M.D., Stephen DeCherney, M.D., Kathleen McNicholas, M.D., Lanny Edelsohn, M.D., Gerald M. Lemole, M.D., Lee S. Cohen, M.D, and Phil Blatt, MD. They also wish to thank especially Elizabeth Lea Carpenter du Pont, Mr. Carpenter's beloved niece who introduced him to his wife, and after whom his youngest daughter was named. A private memorial service was held for immediate family in their home in Wilmington on Saturday, December 20th. Please contact Hardin & Associates at 302-654-9923 for information regarding the memorial service or email information@hardininc.com. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent to Princeton University or to Christiana Care Health System of Delaware."

Instead, the Broncos (8-7) had a three-game lead with three games to play, but fell apart because of a defense that has been so porous that it more than offsets the top-ranked offense in the A.F.C. As the Broncos have faded, the Chargers, who looked all but dead at the halfway point, have rallied.

Shoppers on bikes, scooters, carriages and unicycles showed spirit, as did a police horse with sleigh bells on its martingale.

The 57th Street windows, Nos. 6 and 7, represent deliverers of mail. The details are amazing, as in No. 1, the bird window, of which Nos. 2 and 3 are aspects. Nos. 4 and 5 depict a grotto of shells. Also not to be missed are the 58th Street windows, No, 11; and the bears, No. 12, at Bergdorf's men's store across the way.

2008-12-29T11:27:10Z,"Scotland has already given the world Robert Burns, Walter Scott and Donovan, and now an American professor says it is also the birthplace of rap battles. Ferenc Szasz, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico who specializes in American and Scottish culture, says in a new study that the lyrical tradition of battle rap derives from an ancient Caledonian practice called “flyting,” The Telegraph reported. Examples of flyting, a kind of verbal dueling in which opponents would trade rhyming (and often obscene) insults at each other, date at least as far back as the 16th century; Mr. Szasz said that Scottish slaveowners brought the practice to America, where it later evolved into hip-hop. Comparing practitioners of flyting and hip-hop performers, Mr. Szasz said: “Both cultures accord high marks to satire. The skilled use of satire takes this verbal jousting to its ultimate level — one step short of a fistfight.”"
2008-12-29T10:53:02Z,"At least as far back as “Take the Money and Run,” Woody Allen has been trying to draw attention away from his musical abilities. (As a frustrated cello teacher recalls of his character, Virgil Starkwell, in that fake documentary: “He had no conception of the instrument. He was blowing into it.”) But on Sunday, Mr. Allen shared his clarinet skills with an audience of nearly 3,000 listeners at a concert in Warsaw, The Associated Press reported. The rare concert at which Mr. Allen performed outside his hometown was held at Warsaw’s Sala Kongresowa, and featured the filmmaker playing traditional jazz numbers with his New Orleans Jazz Band. “We will do our best to entertain you,” Mr. Allen told the audience, according to The A.P., before the start of the two-hour show, during which he performed several solos. Outside of Mr. Allen’s appearances at the Cafe Carlyle, his clarinet work can also be heard in the score to “Sleeper,” and in the documentary “Wild Man Blues,” about his band’s 1996 tour of Europe."

Brooklyn, of course. In an interview with The Times of London, Andrew Lloyd Webber said that a recently completed sequel to his musical “The Phantom of the Opera” would send the title character to 19th-century Brooklyn, where he is reunited with his lost love, Christine, on the sands of Coney Island. “It was the place,” Mr. Lloyd Webber said, according to The Times of London. “Even Freud went because it was so extraordinary.” He added, “People who were freaks and oddities were drawn towards it because it was a place where they could be themselves.” Mr. Lloyd Webber said he planned to open the “Phantom” sequel, called “Phantom: Love Never Dies,” in London, New York and a city in Asia next year; no theaters have been announced."
2008-12-29T14:15:54Z,"So far, plans for a film spinoff of the late Fox television comedy “Arrested Development” are living up to that show’s title. Mitchell Hurwitz, the creator of “Arrested Development,” the rapid-fire family satire that ended its run in 2006, told the Web site Fancast.com that a deal was in place with Fox Searchlight to create a movie based on the show, but that he would not begin writing a script until its cast was confirmed. During its three-season run, “Arrested Development” starred Jason Bateman as the central member of a highly dysfunctional family that also included Jeffrey Tambor, Will Arnett, and Michael Cera, the star of “Superbad” and “Juno.” Asked if Mr. Arnett and Mr. Cera were the remaining members of the television cast who had not yet signed on for the movie, Mr. Hurwitz said, “I will say that Will Arnett is gung-ho, so there’s a big clue!” He added that the movie might pick up where the show left off, or could be a prequel to the series."
2008-12-29T14:05:48Z,"Though the Tom Cruise movie “Valkyrie” received mixed reviews in the United States, it has been greeted with a measured and hospitable reception in Germany, where it was once viewed with suspicion, Reuters reported. In “Valkyrie,” Mr. Cruise plays Col. Claus Von Stauffenberg, a Prussian officer who led an assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. During the film’s production, the German Defense Ministry briefly refused to allow filming at Berlin’s Benderblock memorial, citing Mr. Cruise’s beliefs in Scientology (which is not a recognized religion in Germany), and Stauffenberg’s son, Berthold, told Der Spiegel, “I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of the project.” But in writing about “Valkyrie,” the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper said that any fears that the “myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter has turned out to be wrong and prejudicial.” And the German public broadcaster ZDF said that “Valkyrie” was “neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century. Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film.”"

The International Monetary Fund today released its own list of recommendations for an internationally coordinated stimulus plan.

2008-12-29T20:27:51Z,"One thing that's been bothering me about the discussion over fiscal stimulus is the virtual absence of fully worked-out models, with all their t's dotted and eyes crossed, or something. Not that a rigorous model is always better than a rough-and-ready but more realistic approach, but I like to have both on hand. So I've tried a very rough sketch of a full, intertemporal maximization yada yada analysis of the fiscal policy issue. It was written in a hurry, so it's surely incomprehensible to readers who don't know the New Keynesian Economics literature, and probably incomprehensible even to those who do."

2008-12-29T00:00:00Z,"It would be easier to figure out this matchup if the Miami Dolphins had one strength. They do nothing spectacularly -- they were ranked in the middle of the league in both offense and defense -- but instead do everything solidly. They commit few penalties and make few turnovers, and they are resourceful with their personnel. The Ravens' defense is a top-three unit, but it will have to prepare for everything -- the Dolphins unveiled new Wildcat wrinkles against the Jets -- and it will have to hope it can force the occasional turnover. It helps, of course, that they have Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, who seems to intercept passes in his sleep. But like the Falcons and Vikings, the Ravens are entering the great unknown with an inexperienced quarterback going into the playoffs. Joe Flacco has been solid all season, and the Ravens can now score in bunches -- something they haven't done in years. PLAYERS TO WATCH: The entire Baltimore Ravens defense and Dolphins quarterback Chad Pennington. The Chargers' reward for not packing it in a month ago when they were three games down? A first-round meeting with the Colts, the hottest team entering the playoffs with nine straight victories. Still, the Chargers eliminated the Colts from the playoffs last season, and Indianapolis needed a last-second field goal to beat San Diego in November. The Chargers' pass defense was once the worst in the league, but entering Sunday's game against the Broncos, they had allowed just three passing touchdowns and intercepted six passes in the previous three games. The revived pass defense will get its ultimate test against the Colts, who rode Peyton Manning all season as the running game disappeared because of Joseph Addai's injury. Addai is back -- he scored on a screen pass and 55-yard run against the Titans -- and Manning is better than ever."

2008-12-29T00:00:00Z,"Nobody -- not even Andy Reid -- could have imagined that benching quarterback Donovan McNabb would eventually lead to the playoffs. But after McNabb hit rock bottom on Nov. 23, the Eagles have gone 4-1 to surge into the playoffs. They will encounter Reid's former offensive coordinator, Brad Childress, whose Vikings bear striking similarities to the Eagles. The Vikings pass rusher Jared Allen will give the Eagles' protection headaches all day. But McNabb's mobility makes him far better equipped to anticipate and escape pressure than the inexperienced Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson is to handle the Eagles' blitz-happy defense. As much attention as will be paid to the quarterbacks, both offenses rely heavily on their running backs -- the Vikings on Adrian Peterson, the Eagles on the all-around threat Brian Westbrook.

The study, conducted by Brigham Young University, looked at the races, genders and family backgrounds of characters in 82 books that won the award between 1922 and 2007. It found that fewer books featuring black and Hispanic characters had won the award in the past 27 years than in the years between 1951 and 1979. “The Newbery is given for literary quality — ethnicity, gender, nothing of that is necessarily taken into consideration,” said Pat Scales, the president of the Association for Library Service to Children, which awards the Newbery Medal.
