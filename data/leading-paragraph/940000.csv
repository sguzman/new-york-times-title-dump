1899-04-16T00:00:00Z,"HAVANA, April 7. -- In going to a strange country one does not as a rule think beforehand what he will eat while there.

At once the item of eating rises from one of slight importance to one of great moment."

1899-04-17T00:00:00Z,"The new corporation system of doing business, the result, mainly, of excessive competition and cheap money, is perhaps the most remarkable of the end-of-the-century phenomena. The centralizations of control, commonly and slangily called ""trusts,"" have, since peace with Spain was assured, been on a gigantic scale."

1899-04-17T00:00:00Z,"I have read the German opposition to a British alliance with this country, and it seems to be all prejudice and jealousy. I have not seen any good reason against an alliance. One German friend uses arguments to the effect that the English are liars, selfish, and greedy. But it is easy to call names. It reminds me of a lawyer when he has a bad case -- he abuses the other side."

The city seemed deserted and even the churches were not well attended. The advent of stages on the avenue made a bit of a sensation, and the absence of wheeling people was a relief."

1899-04-17T00:00:00Z,"I read with interest your Monday editorial on the terms which should prevail in the taking over of the street railroads of Detroit for the municipality. Your implied conclusion that some compromise between $5,000,000 and $11,000,000 would be fair is one in which the logical Socialist may agree without sacrificing his principles for the following reasons, in the statement of which I shall have recourse to the clarifying force of simple algebraic forms:"

1899-04-17T00:00:00Z,"Some of the facts brought out so far by the Mazet inquiry concerning the judiciary of the city are very unpleasant. We say ""brought out,"" but they were already only too well known. In this as in other matters the novel and significant feature of the testimony is that it is given by persons directly interested in the business, by two ex-Judges and RICHARD CROKER."

1899-04-18T00:00:00Z,"Not a single new development of consequence was disclosed in Wall Street yesterday, but the stock market showed reactionary tendencies. With few exceptions quotations declined.

I seen some reminiscences or letters of his or something or other and I thought then there was very likely the making of a good play out of some of his novels.

The worshippers of the young author -- who, of course, are men -- will doubtless take the ground tacitly assumed by Mr. Kipling himself, that since men are superior in life they cannot fail to retain their superiority in fiction of the highest order."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"The second number of The Bulletin of the Free Library of Philadelphia Mr. John Thomson devotes to the description of that series of works known as ""The Library of Old Authors.""

1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Since Mr. William Waldorf Astor's appearance in the literary arena he has written several things, some of which showed a keen, observing, and not altogether unimaginative mind; others showed the result of what must have been no small amount of literary toil and patient research. But in all that he has hitherto done there has hardly been revealed the individuality that one might expect. At length he has his opportunity to make such a revelation."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"I am a stranger in this country, having landed from Europe only three months ago. What strikes me as the most remarkable thing I have experienced thus far is the strange behavior of the people around me. To me it seems as if everybody was crazy or at least intoxicated."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"You have, indeed, chronicled the fact, but certainly the publication of a new edition of Timrod's Poems by Houghton, Mifflin Co. is worthy of further notice in your impartial columns. In 1873, ""The Poems of Henry Timrod"" was issued by E.J. Hale Son, publishers, New York, edited with a sympathetic sketch by Paul H. Hayne. This edition, which is now very rare, was the last."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"If the following story has not been told on anybody later than Socrates, I shall be content; in that case it will be as nearly new as a story can legitimately hope to be.

Mr. Howells championed ""lunch"" as the proper term, while his wife defended ""luncheon."""
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"The talk is everywhere now as to giving Admiral Dewey a princely, royal reception on his return. Somehow, for some reason, the idea does not seem republican or democratic, whichever way you use those synonymous words, in their loftiest sense, for it savors of kingly pageantry, to be not in accordance with the genius of our simple form of government."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, May 12. -- The Inter-State Commerce Commission will begin next Monday, in New York, an investigation into the subject of the export rates made by the various transcontinental lines, the most discouraging feature of the present rate situation."

1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Perhaps these titles of novels might be inserted in the chronological list of New York fiction. The last two have no literary value whatsoever, but the penultimate one reveals the New York standard of luxury in fiction some forty-odd years ago, and the last describes Bellevue and the Tombs as they were at about the same time:"

1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"The biographical notice of Mr. Israel F. Fischer, recently appointed United States General Appraiser, which appears in this morning's issue of your paper, is of value in establishing his qualifications as a party whip.

1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"From the tone of your editorials, I note you hold that charity can do great things to ameliorate bad social conditions.

This is the answer: ""Both he and Miss Barrett loathed concealment."
1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"The communications regarding ball playing on the streets must have met with much sympathy from all who have suffered from this intolerable nuisance. Let me say a word, however, not in toleration of the evil, but in defense of the boys."

1899-05-13T00:00:00Z,"In looking over Prof. Beers's recently published book, ""A History of English Romanticism in the Eighteenth Century,"" I was rather astonished to discover that Heine's account of the romantic school in Germany (Heinrich Heine, ""The Romantic School,"" translation, New York, 1882,) is the only treatise dealing specifically with this particular subject, to which reference is made."

The second part contains the correspondence, letters written to friends and relatives and to the Blackwoods."

A large wholesale dealer told one of his customers that it would be worth his while to buy an extra supply of beef and lamb yesterday, for an additional quarter of a cent a pound would be added within a few days."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Aug. 19. -- The lower house of the Prussian Diet to-day rejected the entire Canal bill by a vote of 225 to 147, thirty-two of the members abstaining from voting.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"To retain the death penalty for one sex and not for the other seems to us monstrously unreasonable. The crime is exactly as injurious to society in the one case as in the other, and morally the woman who murders is often more guilty than the man. She is more trusted, her instrument -- poison -- is more treacherous, and she is almost invariably sober."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Mrs. Lottie Lewis, who lives at 370 Seventh Avenue, is a patient at Bellevue with malaria, which the physicians in charge of the case trace to mosquito bites.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 19. -- The season has reached its height, and fully 30,000 visitors are now being entertained here. It is a cosmopolitan multitude, and the largest that has been seen here at one time, barring floral fete weeks, for over a decade. The vast throng is composed of everybody, from ecclesiastic to gambler, and all seem to be enjoying themselves."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"The revelations of the Dreyfus trial are usually quoted as evidence of the decadence of France and the Latin races, but this is surely a narrow view of their upshot. It appears that the foreign embassies at Paris, and notably the German, are nothing more or less than detective bureaus, provided with corruption funds, and served by a corps of spies, informers, and cheats, at whose head is the Military Attache."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"In to-day's issue of your paper I read with considerable amusement of the desperate measures attempted by the Summer residents of Newport against the kodak fiends who infest the shore, and, worse than all, take ""unflattering"" portraits of our so-called society beauties on their return from the bath, afterward reproducing them in our newspapers."

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Southern Pacific held well above 40 yesterday in the face of heavy realizing selling by speculators who seem to look upon that price as the top notch for the stock. Pool brokers quietly absorbed all offerings and showed confidence in higher prices, although making no attempt to advance the price."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"SAN SEBASTIAN, July 13. -- This crown of nature's fancy work, San Sebastian, this city in a fairy tale, is just now all alive with expectancy, looking every day for the coming of the Court. It is reputed to be the cleanest town of the Peninsula, and is, in truth, as bright as a wave-washed pebble. Nevertheless, it is a favorite waltz hall of the fleas, which shamelessly obtrude themselves even into conversation."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"In your issue of yesterday I was much interested in an item of news of a patrol wagon being struck by a Second Avenue car at Twenty-second Street on Wednesday night. I was particularly interested in this item because my eldest son was badly injured by a cable car on lower Whitehall Street on Friday evening, the 4th inst., between 8 and 9 o'clock."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"The twenty-first anniversary of the introduction of fireworks at Manhattan Beach will be celebrated next Saturday night, with the ""Annual Carnival of Fire,"" in Pain's Open Air Theatre.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Caricature of the Germans is popular from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is not necessary to seek it in the comic papers, for the editorials of the great newspapers furnish it just as well; and the ridiculous middle-class German is mostly much less amusing than that absurd creature which in parlor gossip and club talk is quite seriously substituted for the inhabitant of the fatherland."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 19. -- A revolutionary group which assembled between Cupey and Esterovasa, in Santo Domingo, has dispersed without fighting, and has re-entered Haitian territory."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Although the programme of coming gayeties here is fairly well filled until Sept. 10, the end of the season is in sight, and with the disbandment of the fleet of the New York Yacht Club on Thursday there were apparent signs of that restlessness which is sure evidence that the social world is preparing for another flight."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Construction of the Panama Railroad was began in the month of May, 1850, and it was opened for traffic Jan. 28, 1855. The length of the road is forty-seven and one-half miles.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"About thirty years ago there was a revival in Paris of the mediaeval ""Mystery."" The ""Deluge"" in one theatre competed with ""Paradise"" in another, and there was a third, whose exact title I forget, though I remember Abraham kneeling before a luminous trinitarian triangle in the sky, and the descent of ballet angels who danced round him."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"AIX-LES-BAINS, Aug. 5. -- This famous French watering place is just entering the second midseason of its year.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"More than 400 men participated in the supplementary pistol and rifle practice at Creedmoor, L.I., yesterday, and despite warm and cloudy weather the crowd was the largest that has been on the ranges this season.

It was on account of the appearance of this case that the marine battalion was ordered North."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Aug. 19. -- Justice Sabath has appeared in several roles foreign to his office in settling the family affairs of Andrew Bloom of 733 Twenty-second Street, recently. Bloom had a notion that he wanted to return to his home in Sweden without his family. He therefore sold his home and other belongings, sent the draft and his trunk to New York, and bought a steamship ticket."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"Philadelphia stopped the New York winning streak at the Polo Grounds yesterday, where nearly 5,000 persons had gathered in the hope of seeing the locals score their fifth straight victory.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"I KNOW all that you would say, Anselma; for have we not talked of this over and over again? Still, I say we should take Inocente to the city and let the foreign doctor see whether God and the saints have given him power to cure the boy."""
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 1, -- It seems hardly necessary to contradict the absurd rumor, published in certain French sheets, concerning the sensational telegram sent by the Czar to Prince Louis Bonaparte. Nobody in Russia considered this telegram as being anything but a canard. The very terms of the dispatch were sufficient to prove that it had never been sent by the Czar to Prince Louis."

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"THE success of the series of Summer night's concerts given under the conductorship of Mr. Franz Kaltenborn at the St. Nicholas Garden, at Columbus Avenue and Sixty-sixth Street, is gratifying to all lovers of good music, as well as to those who have wished for the establishment of some place of resort in the warm weather at which something more artistic than mere vaudeville could be found."

HOLAHAN, President of the Board of Public Improvements, is in a position of very considerable peril, which he daily makes worse by his extraordinary statements to representatives of the newspapers.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 19. -- England begins to appreciate, as America has done for many years, the difference between blacks and whites. The disappearance of Miss Jewell with the alleged ""Lobengula"" has raised a storm of indignation, has greatly injured the show at which the negro appeared, and has done much to widen the difference between the races."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"While yesterday's bank statement was not up to some of the favorable forecasts made on Thursday and Friday, it was generally regarded as favorable. The figures, however, had little or no influence upon the stock market, the exhibit not being of a character to induce either buying or selling. The changes shown were comparatively unimportant."

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"The quarrel of the surgeons in the case of M. LABORI, or the attempt of one physician of repute who has interested himself in the case, as it seems, to force a quarrel upon the surgeon placed in charge of the wounded man by his family, is not necessarily to be taken as a result of professional jealousy."
1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"BATTERY Park is New York's front yard. At its gate, the Barge Office, picturesque groups of immigrants arrive daily. Visitors from the rural districts set the Battery down among the first places of interest that they will go to see in New York."

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"THE only two old-fashioned wooden hand pumps for drawing drinking water on Manhattan Island are situated on Trinity Place, between Cedar and Thames Streets. Unfortunately, however, for the lover of true romance of whom Kipling writes, these old pumps convey no visions of the ""moss-covered bucket that hung in the well,"" for they are connected with the Croton mains and supply pure Croton water the same as any ordinary, prosaic hydrant."

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"VIENNA, Aug. 1. -- There is hardly a day now without a demonstration. Everything is topsy-turvey in this State; the discontent is universal. The labor party is at war with the anti-Semites, the Germans with the Government, and the Czechs and their allies against the Germans.

1899-08-20T00:00:00Z,"""Coy baggage"" seemed to apply not merely to the modest and retiring maid -- or ""girl,"" as we should now say -- but rather to one who made pretense of modesty, using it as an additional weapon of offense and as a new snare wherewith to decoy men into the net of her charms. For the expression infers considerable personal charm."

1899-09-01T00:00:00Z,"RENNES, Aug. 31. -- Dreyfus had the most trying day he has gone through. The strain proved too great for him, and for the second time in the course of the trial he gave way to his feelings and sought relief in tears."
1899-09-01T00:00:00Z,"RENNES, Aug. 31. -- Capt. Dreyfus again changed his attitude to-day, probably through the recollection of the scene of the degradation being recalled. Capt. Lebrun-Renault's evidence stirred a deep emotion in the prisoner.

1899-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The common American locution, ""We've got 'em on the run,"" is one that Capt. DREYFUS and Maitre LABORI are well entitled to use to each other at Rennes. The fact is that it is simply impossible as soon as the light of world-wide or even France-wide publicity is turned upon the proceedings of the court-martial which convicted DREYFUS in the dark for another court-martial to repeat those proceedings in the daylight."
1899-09-01T00:00:00Z,"The words in which Capt. DREYFUS is reported to have owned his debt to his wife will move even more hearts than have been touched by the tragedy of wrong and suffering in which he has borne the most conspicuous role.

1899-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Yet another would-be critic of the ""Cynic"" displays her superficial erudition by citing the titles of books she has never read and illustrates the confusion of her moral standards in attempting to draw (?) nice distinctions between ""erotica"" and ""naturalia"" and ""pornographica.""

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"I am a Filipino, in favor of being annexed to the United States, as many of my countrymen would be if they could be certain of annexation combined with justice. Under the terms of the treaty of Paris, which the United States Commissioners have signed, there is no guarantee of stopping any of the evils which brought on the war, and which my countrymen are trying to abate."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Two big century runs will be held to-day, the New York Firemen's Cycle Club and the Royal Arcanum Wheelmen starting runs this morning. Of the two the New York firemen will probably obtain the most patronage. It is not the firemen's first attempt in this direction, and more than 500 cyclists are expected to take part if the day is clear."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"I was very much gratified at the prominence you gave to Frederic Harrison's plain statement regarding the grave crisis between the Boers and the English, a statement I earnestly hope is indorsed by the majority of my countrymen."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"STANDING, not ""where the brook and river meet,"" but where the sweet Summertime fades away into the mists of Autumn and the song birds that thrive in the Winter cast their press agent's shadows before, one hesitates to peer too far into the future. What does the cup of the Winter hold for us?"

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Attempting to advance somewhat the solution of the problem, THE NEW YORK TIMES has collected the views of the Governors of a number of Southern States on how lynching is to be prevented. It must be admitted that the result is not very satisfactory. All that is absolutely learned is that a Governor is not ex-officio an authority upon the solution of any social problem."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"An attempt to beat bogey was made yesterday by the members of the Morris County Golf Club at Morristown, N.J. The tournament was a handicap, or else many of the competitors would have given up in despair, for it is heartbreaking to a ninety-five man to be told to break the bogey score of eighty-six, the score used on the Morris County links."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"NEWPORT, Sept. 9. -- The largest gathering ever assembled at the Newport Golf Club since its organization was present this afternoon. At one time it appeared as if the entire cottage colony, with their guests, were either about the clubhouse park waiting for the golf club tea or watching the players competing for the cups offered by the club in handicap competition."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Sept. 9. -- The Tribune to-morrow will say:"
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"After remaining out of sight for nearly three weeks, Richard Croker returned to the city yesterday. His reappearance was as sudden and unexpected as his occultation for three weeks had been inexplicable, but in his usual unperturbed way he turned up smiling a mysterious smile and apparently as self-satisfied as though he had nightly been receiving the homage of his adherents at the Democratic Club."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 9. -- President William McKinley and William J. Bryan were honored to-day by the newly formed association of Spanish War Veterans. Col.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"A gentleman from Cincinnati was looking out of my office windows to-day -- twentieth story -- and as he looked toward the Hudson River he exclaimed: ""Well, that's just like the Ohio!"" What he referred to was half a dozen boats, mostly tugs, from the smokestacks of which dense black clouds were pouring."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"SARANAC, Sept. 9. -- The open golf tournament on the Ampersand links took place this week. Three beautiful silver cups were put up and played for.

March came in a close second."

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Labor Day, followed by the Jewish holiday on Tuesday, acted as a severe handicap on business in the early part of the week with the result that the market's showing for the last six days has been unsually poor even for this season of the year."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"A well-dressed man was driven to Bellevue Hospital yesterday in a carriage from Jersey City. He was paralyzed in both legs. He gave his name as William F.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Me., Sept. 9. -- The last dance of the Summer at the Malvern generally means the termination of the season, yet it is said that there are many functions still to be held. The weekly dances at the Malvern this Summer have been welcomed heartily by the dancing portion of the Summer colony, as, save while the ships were in port, few opportunities have been afforded for dancing."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"More than 12,000 persons were at Washington Park, Brooklyn, yesterday to see the final game of the season between the Brooklyns and the Bostons. As in Friday's game, the Bostons were beaten without making a run. It was one of the best exhibitions of pitching on the part of McJames, the home pitcher, that was ever seen on a local ball field."

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"I have read THE NEW YORK TIMES almost constantly for twelve years, and my opinions on great public questions have nearly always coincided with those expressed in its columns; perhaps, indeed, they have more than once influenced me. It is therefore with profund regret and in fact distrust and disgust, that I note your advocacy of the cowardly McKinley ""war"" in the Philippines."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The yacht Shamrock did not leave her mooring in the Horseshoe yesterday, but, nevertheless, it was not a day of rest for her crew.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"September's second week finds Newport still gay, Bar Harbor with only a few cottagers left, and Narragansett with closed doors.

He understands the Transvaal's last dispatch as an acceptance of the proposal for a joint commission of inquiry."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"RENNES, Sept. 9. -- The expected has happened. Dreyfus has been condemned; though a majority of those in the courtroom this afternoon fully expected the verdict, they were completely stupefied when it was given, and the silence which prevailed in the room and the way men turned pale and caught their breaths were more impressive than any other manifestation could have been."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 9. -- T.P. O'Connor's M.A.P. (Mainly About People) says that though Lord William Beresford has every prospect of being second on the list of winning race-horse owners at the end of the season, if is doubtful whether he will be financially ahead, as he always has been really to lay great odds on his American horses."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"In no other city on the globe can one become better acquainted with street car etiquette than in New York. Some one over the name of V.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"As interesting in its way as were the preliminary spins of the Shamrock in hers was the attempt this week to revive light-harness racing at the new track of the Empire City Trotting Club, near Yonkers.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Aug. 29. -- The ominous murmurings of the Governmental Aetna have not been followed by the appalling upheaval so universally expected.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"In relation to your special dispatch from Washington of to-day, re the Carter case, I should like to know on what authority your correspondent founds his assertions. He makes bald statements of alleged facts, but no names are given as authority. The authority, however, is undoubtedly the same as that which prompted all other statements against Capt. Carter."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Your issue of to-day contains an editorial on the Carter case which would surprise me more than it does did I not recall to mind the soothing and emollient effects of time and words. Newspapers, I thought, had longer memories than their readers, and yet in twelve months you seem to have forgotten all details of the testimony before the Carter court-martial."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"It is likely that the Tenement House Committee of the Charity Organization Society will make a strong protest against the adoption by the City Council of the new Building Code. The code which has just been drafted by the Building Code Commission will be taken up for adoption by the City Council Tuesday, after a final public hearing to-morrow afternoon."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"SPRING LAKE, N.J., Sept. 9. -- So little has been said about the season at Spring Lake, despite the fact that so many well-known Philadelphia families summer there, that only at the threshold of its closing scenes does it transpire that it has been very gay indeed this year. The most brilliant entertainment of the Summer was given by Mr. and Mrs. W.W. Gibbs and the Misses Gibbs at the Casino on Monday night."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"-- Attention is called by the Washington correspondent of The Philadelphia Press to certain features of the existing situation in the Philippines as duplicating the course of events in the civil war. We are to have in the islands, he says, an army of 65,000 men under a Brigadier of regulars, Gen. OTIS, with no general officer in charge."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The chief prize to be contended for in the campaign now rapidly shaping itself in this State is the Assembly. Because of the peculiar complexion of the Senate, whose nominal Republican majority of two frequently turns out to be a minority, control of the lower house will practically carry with it the control of the Legislature."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"VIRGINIA HOT SPRINGS, Sept. 9. -- The Homestead Hotel here has just entered upon the closing month of the most successful season in its history, and the bookings for September indicate that the Fall business will be equally heavy. It has been a gay Summer throughout, and rooms have been at a premium."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"The Times is disposed to treat moderately and with good nature the anti-imperialists whose enthusiasm leads them to invite the epithets of ""traitor"" and ""treason,"" now being revived as part of the current political vocabulary. But are not the imperialists in this matter drawing rather a long bow?"

On the contrary it has grown and advanced with such strides as to have become at once a separate and important industry and a recognized and permanent branch of useful and decorative art."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Seeing that the reception of Admiral DEWEY will be by far the greatest municipal pageant that New York has ever had, and the first that the Greater New York has had, everything that is likely to affect it, favorably or unfavorably, is a matter of intimate public concern. And decidedly such a matter is the route of the parade."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"THE touch of Mr. Jerome K. Jerome is never heavy, but it is frequently to lingering. He has undoubtedly splendid faith in his own powers as an entertainer, but very little, as it seems, in the intelligence or the sensitiveness of his audiences."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"NEWBURG, N.Y., Sept. 9. -- The condition of Gen. Daniel Butterfield of the Dewey Reception Committee, who is ill as his country home, Craigside, at Cold Spring, is not encouraging.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,In your column of communications in last Monday's TIMES I noticed a derogatory opinion on the Independent Labor Party. Mr. S.N.

1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"In to-day's TIMES I note the terrible crime committed in the shooting of Policeman O'Keefe by that saloon keeper, Farrelli. It is only another evidence of the brazen way in which the saloon keepers and Raines law hotel keepers violate the law. The saloon is getting so bold and open in its flagrant violation of law that it is hard to tell where it will land next."
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 9. -- England is amazed that Dreyfus has been convicted and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The reason for amazement is that the retrial occupied weeks, and no evidence was offered to prove him a traitor. No case in the world was ever more thoroughly sifted. A latitude even amazing was permitted. The whole world held up its hands and said, ""There was nothing like this before."""
1899-09-10T00:00:00Z,"SOUTHAMPTON, L.I., Sept. 9. -- Outside of the large dance given by Mrs. Henry G.

The Windward reports that all on board the Diana were well at the time the vessels separated."
1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"No marked increase in activity showed in the market for outside securities during the past week. The beginning of September, it was expected, would be marked by a partial return, at least, to the activity shown earlier in the year, and although these anticipations may not have been fully realized, some change for the better seems to have been brought about."
1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"There is an air of quiet prevailing in the woolen and worsted goods market that looks strange, after the bustle and life that has been in evidence for so long. The buyers have practically deserted the city, and the active part of woolen textiles is now at the mills. The clothiers are not going to get their sample pieces in very good season, and will be writing and wiring for them very soon."
1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,A thousand wheelmen and wheelwomen scorching along in several more or less compact squadrons was the sight witnessed by the inhabitants of many Long Island villages yesterday.

1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 11. -- It would be difficult to describe adequately the indignation the verdict of the Dreyfus court-martial has evoked everywhere in England. The excitement in the Jewish quarters of London is only natural. Special prayers were offered throughout Saturday in all the synagogues on behalf of Dreyfus, and as soon as the verdict was known Jews and Jewesses were seen at every street corner, expressing execration, and many sobbing bitterly."

1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"No New Yorker needs to be told that the Metropolitan Railway Company is a public benefactor. When one considers the old alternatives of a packed and reeking mass of people on a car of the elevated road, and a snaillike progress in an ill-smelling, ill-lighted horse car, we cannot be too grateful to the corporation which has delivered us from these."

1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"RENNES, Sept. 10. -- Dreyfus has borne the terrible shock of his reconviction with marvelous fortitude -- one might almost say with unnatural calm.

1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"Money market conditions will have large part in Wall Street discussions at the beginning of this week. Bear speculators can add small elements of hysteria to what they have already contributed. For weeks past they have been proclaiming their sureness that not only would surplus reserves disappear from Clearing House statements, but that unless a disturbing contraction of credits took place, deficits would grow serious."
1899-09-11T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Sept. 10. -- We are not at all happy over polities, and the uneasiness is reflected on the money market.

Burton, M.D., on ""Oleomargarine Good Food,"" in THE TIMES of the 7th inst., are so utterly at variance with the facts, that it would appear the author of the letter was either trifling with a credulous public, or was not conversant with the fundamental principles of nutrition."
