A hurricane, a forest fire and, in Bloomsburg, Pa., a roller coaster stalled midloop, suspending 20 riders upside down for more than an hour. Planes fell apart, people ate flowers, grilled tuna meat half raw. A large hole spread in the ozone layer, nightmares washed up on beaches and voracious pear thrips ate Vermont's sugar maples."
