Take the intriguing T.C.U.-B.Y.U. showdown -- it has B.C.S. implications and gives the underrated Mountain West a chance to get some love on a national stage. There are also many other storylines to follow. Can Iowa win at Michigan State? It's really one of the biggest tests left for the undefeated Hawkeyes. Auburn-L.S.U. at night? Why not?

The International Women&#8217;s Air and Space Museum in Cleveland put the sample on display this year, Agence France-Presse reported, and described it as a strand of Earhart&#8217;s hair that had been recovered by a White House maid after the aviatrix, who was a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, stayed there before her final flight. But DNA analysis revealed that it did not match other possessions of Earhart that were found on the Pacific island of Nikumaroro. Earhart went missing over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during an attempted solo flight around the world. The thread still remains on display at the museum as part of an Earhart exhibition that runs through Nov. 15. &#8220;We&#8217;ve changed the sign and explained everything,&#8221; Heather Alexander, the museum&#8217;s manager, told Agence France-Presse, adding that visitors &#8220;show more interest and are very grateful that we are telling the truth and the whole story.&#8221;."

The National Security Archive in Washington said it was filing a Freedom of Information Act request on behalf of a coalition called the National Campaign to Close Guant&#225;namo, including an effort to gain details about how loud music was used as an interrogation technique. Based on public documents and interviews with former detainees, the archive said, Guant&#225;namo prisoners were played loud music, including songs by AC/DC, Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson, as well as advertising jingles and &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221; tunes, in their cells and in preparation for interrogations. Thomas Blanton, the archive&#8217;s director, told The A.P., &#8220;At Guant&#225;namo, the U.S. government turned a jukebox into an instrument of torture.&#8221; A spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guant&#225;namo, which handles the care and custody of detainees, said loud music had not been used with prisoners since the fall of 2003."

Ms. Carbajal added that Mr. Polanski was already &#8220;on the move&#8221; to the Zurich Film Festival and asked if it was preferable to &#8220;maintain our position to extradite from Switzerland.&#8221; Lael Rubin, another deputy district attorney, replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Mr. Polanski was arrested on Sept. 26 by the Swiss authorities as he arrived at the Zurich airport. He remains in a Swiss prison pending his possible extradition to the United States, where he fled sentencing in 1978 after admitting to having sex with a 13-year-old girl."

The National Security Archive in Washington said it was filing a Freedom of Information Act request on behalf of a coalition called the National Campaign to Close Guantánamo, including an effort to gain details about how loud music was used as an interrogation technique. Based on public documents and interviews with former detainees, the archive said, Guantánamo prisoners were played loud music, including songs by AC/DC, Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson, as well as advertising jingles and ''Sesame Street'' tunes, in their cells and in preparation for interrogations. Thomas Blanton, the archive's director, told The A.P., ''At Guantánamo, the U.S. government turned a jukebox into an instrument of torture.''

2009-10-23T00:00:00Z,"BEITCH--Irwin, 71, of Cheshire, Connecticut, died suddenly on October 12, 2009, from complications produced by an overwhelming and insidious bacterial infection. Surviving him are his wife Barbara; his son Rick (Jonathan Eric Beitch); his three grandchildren Andy (Andrew), Miranda, and Sarah; and his brother-in-law Joel Rose, and Joel's wife Pamela Rose. His large and loving family of cousins, nephews, nieces, and other relatives close to Irwin were shocked at this sudden loss and mourn his death. Irwin Beitch was a Professor of Biology at Quinnipiac University, where he taught courses in histology, histochemistry, and biomedical photography. As a dedicated teacher for over 40 years who loved his subject matter as well as his students, Irwin had tremendous impact on the many students whose life-science professions he helped to launch. He had no plans to retire. He was a conscientious, effective, and diligent teacher who kept himself on the cutting edge and incorporated the latest technology into all of his courses. His fraternity brothers at the University of Richmond, the students he taught (while a graduate student at the University of Virginia and later as a faculty member at Quinnipiac University), and the new educators who joined the Quinnipiac faculty all remember him as a caring mentor who took the time to reach out and help them become integrated into the community. He met his wife-to-be, then Barbara Susan Rose, in 1962, on their first day of graduate school at the University of Virginia and they were together ever since. As a married couple, they shared their studies and supported each other in their Ph.D. research, completing their respective degrees within an hour of each other. They started their family together in Charlottesville, where their daughter Deborah was born. Later, while working on postdoctoral fellowships in Ophthalmology Research at Columbia University, they planned their second child, Jonathan Eric (""Rick""), whom they adopted soon after they moved to Connecticut in 1969. Irwin was an active member of the Board of Directors for the Sleeping Giant Park Association, where he was the Chairman of the Hiking Committee and Photography Editor of the Giant News. He was a ""behind the scenes"" man, pouring love and energy into projects associated with the Sleeping Giant, as well as many endeavors at Quinnipiac University and volunteer work at the Yale Peabody Museum. He always seemed to manage to give to others the accolades and recognition for this work. He and his wife loved to travel. As avid scuba divers, they visited and photographed coral reefs and underwater volcanic ecosystems all over the world. In addition, they traveled together in Europe, in Ecuador and Central America, from the highlands of Papua New Guinea to the protected animal preserves of Zambia and Botswana, and recently went on an educational trip to cities and small towns in many parts of China. Irwin was an avid and talented photographer who recorded all of these experiences first on film and, in more recent years, digitally. His family and friends will be able to enrich their memories of Irwin as they peruse the wonderful photographs he took over the years. Irwin Beitch touched and truly enriched the lives of countless colleagues, friends, and students and will long be remembered for his empathy and caring for others as well as his infamous dry wit and gifts as a story teller. Although born of Jewish parents and raised in the Jewish tradition, he was a free spirit who always said that he ""worshiped at the library."" A memorial service for Irwin Beitch will be held on November 19 at 7pm, in Alumni Hall at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, CT. Memorial contributions in his name may be made to the Sleeping Giant Park Association, P.O. Box 185340, Hamden, CT 06518-0340. For further information call Levine Memorial Chapel at 518-438-1002."

But that point was made even more clear when Bishop Lawrence C. Provenzano, who represents the 146 congregations in the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), dashed off a response to the announcement, made by the Vatican on Tuesday. ''At the heart of all of this is the reality that the Roman Church is willing to welcome angry, reactionary, misogynistic, homophobic people,'' he wrote in a statement."

2009-10-23T00:00:00Z,"McMAHON--T. Gordon, on October 20, 2009. T. Gordon McMahon died at age 56 in New York City of multiple myeloma cancer. Gordon is survived by his wife, Dede Dalton McMahon and his three children, Katherine, Ryan and Rachel McMahon of New York City, his mother, Thelma McMahon of Washington and sisters Doris McMahon of Florida and Diane McMahon of Milwaukee, WI. Gordon is also survived by his former wife, Karen Li of New York City. Gordon was born in Washington December 29, 1952 to Thelma and the late Thomas Anthony McMahon. He grew up in Washington where he attended Archbishop Carroll High School a school that remained important to him throughout his life. He received his undergraduate degree in Psychology from Yale University and an MBA in Finance From Harvard Business School. After Harvard, Wall Street beckoned Gordon but he opted instead for the glamour and climate of California where he opened his first business venture, an ice cream parlor called ""Just Desserts,"" but Wall Street still pursued him and in late 1976 the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs convinced him that the real glamour was indeed on Wall Street and he began his career at the storied investment house. Gordon enjoyed phenomenal success at Goldman Sachs and, at age 31, was elected a general partner in the firm the youngest partner ever up until that time. After retiring from Goldman in 1993, Gordon worked briefly for one of his former clients, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, but it was not long before Gordon realized that the business role he liked most was that of an entrepreneur and for the rest of his life, Gordon was involved in investing in and often times running start-up companies. He loved the challenges and the learning experiences they provided. Gordon always remembered and appreciated what he learned from others, especially his parents, Thelma and Thomas whom he considered his heroes. The central lesson of life he took from them is that ""family is everything"" and he shared this philosophy freely with everyone he knew. He also felt strongly about the positive influence his years at Archbishop Carroll had on him and he continued to give back time and money to the school throughout his adult life. The large number of family and friends Gordon left behind all feel tremendously blessed to have known and loved him and are thankful for the life that he shared with them."

Late Thursday, according to Swiss authorities, the U.S. government delivered its formal request that Mr. Polanski be returned to the United States to face sentencing on a 32-year-old charge of having sex with a minor. That means the Polanski team failed to persuade the Justice Department to terminate the extradition­ — a step that would almost certainly have stirred a heavy backlash from those who want to see Mr. Polanski face the courts."

He died on June 25 from an overdose of several drugs, including propofol, an anesthetic he had been taking as a sleeping aid.

But confidential data from the N.F.L.'s dementia assistance plan strongly corroborates claims of a link between football and later-life cognitive impairment. Records indicate that pro football's retirees are experiencing moderate to advanced early-onset dementia at rates several times higher than the general population, the most glaring evidence to date of the dangers of professional football in past eras."

2009-10-24T00:00:00Z,"FOLEY--Patrick. The New York Law School community mourns the passing of Patrick J. Foley, Class of 1961, one of the Law School's most distinguished graduates. Mr. Foley spent 32 years with American International Group, Inc. (AIG), culminating in his retirement in 1995 as Vice President and Associate General Counsel. He was also General Counsel of AIG's domestic insurance companies. A man with infinite energy and creativity, Mr. Foley had his own definition of retirement: He served as a director for three of AIG's subsidiary companies, and founded two successful companies, for which he served as President--Foley Atlantis Consultants, an advising and consulting company based in South Florida, and Foley Atlantis Holding Corp., a real estate company. Challenged in recent years by illnesses, neither his great sense of humor nor his incomparable talent for storytelling wavered, and his thirst for knowledge and new challenges flourished unabated. Mr. Foley attended New York Law School as an evening student while working simultaneously for Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, graduating in 1961. An active, prominent member of the Law School community throughout his life, he served as a Director of the Alumni Association and continuously provided generous support. In 1986, he established the Patrick J. Foley '61 Scholarship Fund with additional funding provided by both AIG and his wife Ann through a matching gift from her employer, IBM. Since its inception, the Patrick J. Foley Scholarship has been instrumental in enabling evening division students who work in the insurance industry to achieve a legal education. The Law School is grateful to both Pat and Ann, whose passing we also mourned this year. We extend our condolences to their children John and Maureen, and their granddaughter Nicole. Pat Foley was a giant of a man, an example to us all, and we will miss him. Arthur N. Abbey Chairman of the Board of Trustees Richard A. Matasar Dean and President"

Pemberton served as the national Executive Director of the ACLU from 1962-70, at the peak of the civil rights struggle and the escalation of the Vietnam War. Under Pemberton's leadership, the ACLU helped achieve victories in landmark cases such as Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage; Gideon v. Wainwright, which ensured felony defendants have the right to an attorney at trial; and Griswold v. Connecticut, which found that Americans have a constitutional right to privacy. Based on these successes and others, the ACLU doubled its membership under his stewardship. Pemberton followed his tenure at the ACLU as a distinguished leader in labor and employment law, serving as Acting General Counsel and Regional Attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as a law professor at the University of San Francisco (USF) School of Law from 1973-88. USF hosts an annual Pemberton Lecture on Workplace Justice in his honor. A passionate advocate of nonviolence and equality for all, Pemberton was instrumental in establishing the ACLU as a truly national organization through some of the most critical years in American civil rights history.

It tells the story of Harvey Milk, a neighborhood activist elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 -- and one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country -- who was killed the next year, along with the city's mayor, George Moscone (Victor Garber), by a former supervisor, Dan White (Josh Brolin). Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film ''accessible and instructive, an astute chronicle of big-city politics and the portrait of a warrior whose passion was equaled by his generosity and good humor.'' He added: ''Mr. Penn, an actor of unmatched emotional intensity and physical discipline, outdoes himself here, playing a character different from any he has portrayed before'' -- the difference being less a matter of sexuality than of Milk's extroverted, and occasionally stubborn, temperament. ''All of this Mr. Penn captures effortlessly through voice and gesture, but what is most arresting is the sense he conveys of Milk's fundamental kindness, a personal virtue that also functions as a political principle.'' Dustin Lance Black also earned an Oscar for best screenplay. 10:30 A.M.

Born in 1933 in Queens, Pearl graduated from Hunter High School and Syracuse University, cum laude. She moved with her husband to the Upper West Side in 1963 and became a quintessential Upper West Sider. Her husband passed in his sleep when her children were nine and three and Pearl courageously raised them while forging a successful career in publishing. She retired from the CUNY Academy in 2002. Her children fondly remember the exceptionally engaging conversations at dinner parties with her wordsmithing friends. After retiring, she enjoyed life in her cherished Upper West Side apartment, meeting frequently with friends, reading voraciously, and walking in the neighborhood. When her health became a hindrance, she moved to Chapel Hill, NC, to be near her son. There she greatly enjoyed her grandchildren and was happy and well cared for. She will be deeply missed. A remembrance will be held in early 2010. In lieu of flowers, please consider donations to Amnesty International, the Doe Fund, or Bide-a-wee."

''It's incredible that you have such wilderness so close to the city, and so close to the place where I'm living. Canopy Tower was a military radar station built by the U.S. Air Force back in 1965 to defend the canal. After the Air Force left, the tower was eventually converted into an eco-lodge. You really get to be in the canopy: open the window of your room and probably less than 40 feet away are hundreds of bird species. You see toucans flying by, fruit crows, motmots, blue cotingas and green shrike-vireos. They also have a library, which is really cool because you can easily check out what you just saw -- or think you saw. So you get engaged: it's not a boring activity as some people think. Some bird-watchers were saying that here, in a matter of days, they had seen as many species as they had in many other countries on many different occasions combined. The diversity is amazing.''"

2009-10-25T00:00:00Z,"FIRE IN THE AMERICAN WEST is a season, like winter. Yet even though the number of large wildfires across the Western states has increased fourfold in the last few decades, we continue to build our homes in sagebrush; in steep, wooded canyons; in lightning country surrounded by dry chaparral -- in other words, we build in landscapes prone to burn. And when a fire comes through and destroys everything, we rebuild bigger. Twenty-five miles north of downtown San Diego, the Rancho Bernardo neighborhood is just such a place. The land was bought in 1961 by a developer from Texas who envisioned a sprawling paradise. In the early years, Rancho Bernardo was heavily marketed in the Midwest with an ad campaign that promised a relaxed lifestyle: ''the 52-week vacation.'' On Oct. 22, 2007, the fourth-largest wildfire in the state's history, the Witch fire, devastated Rancho Bernardo, burning hundreds of homes. Many residents had only minutes to evacuate. Afterward, larger, more lavish houses went up in the community of 40,000. Individually, the images on these pages are portraits of ravage and reconstruction -- phoenix-from-the-ashes stories played out in the subdivisions of Southern California. But seen collectively, they tell a broader and perhaps darker story about living in a landscape made ever more flammable by drought, improper forest management, climate change and runaway development. Sasha Bezzubov began photographing landscapes scarred by wildfires in 2003 as part of a series capturing the aftermath of tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes and other catastrophic events around the world. A few months ago, The New York Times Magazine sent Bezzubov back to Rancho Bernardo, which he photographed after the 2007 fire, to document what had happened since, from the same vantage points. What he found was the reassembling of ruined things. Opposite: The remnants of Erick and Raquel Aguilars' house. Above: Their new, bigger house."

When I was a child in the late '60s and early '70s, the horror slate was a splendid array, ranging from the relative innocence of monster-ramas to the erotically tinged creature flicks of Britain's famed Hammer Studios. Somewhere in between were the less stylish but often enjoyable low-budget drive-in fare from America's exploitation studios (almost all of which went out of business years ago) and the occasional major-studio horror movies often rereleased at this time of year. But this mostly imaginative crop devolved to the dime-a-dozen, cut-'em-up-and-watch-'em-bleed movies, of which ''Friday the 13th'' is perhaps the most famous example. Although I was one of the earliest group of writers for Fangoria, the horror-movie magazine, and also acted in a couple of horror films years ago, my opinion of the genre's more grotesque examples has changed."

''Madison Square Garden -- it's the beginning of a new city on a hill.'' The creator of ''Mad Men,'' Matthew Weiner, is well known for being fastidious about period detail -- from the lingo and popular drinks to determining whether a guest at the wedding of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Margaretta Murphy (known as Happy) would have been able to drive to the Sterlings' country club party later that day. So, too, with bringing actual news stories to the screen. For the Madison Square Garden episode, he dug up old ''Save Penn Station'' fliers, though the most striking -- ''Rape on 34th St'' -- was his own creation."

He fought a long, valiant battle against Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. He was born in Brookline, MA on July 21, 1935. He was the son of the late Harold and Ellen Grossman Wald. He is survived by his beloved wife, Sheila and cherished children Alison Wald and Alex Seitz Wald. His eldest son, John was killed in an avalanche in 1996. Stephen attended Milton Academy in Milton, MA and was graduated from Harvard College and The Harvard Business School. He spent his entire career in the Investment Management Business, primarily as a managing partner with Reich and Tang in New York. Upon retirement, he was selected by the US Government to head up the Czech and Slovak American Enterprise Fund which was created after the iron curtain came down as a means of stimulating the economy in Eastern Europe. Stephen and his wife spent three years in Prague. Upon leaving this assignment he was instrumental in creating the first western brokerage firm in Eastern Europe, Wood & Co. which became the largest such firm in that part of the world. In 1994 Stephen & Sheila moved full time to Telluride, CO where they had maintained a part time residence. In Telluride, Stephen devoted himself to the non-profit world. He was a founding Board Member of the Telluride Foundation, serving on several committees. He was past Chairman of the Telluride Medical Center, Board Member of Mountain Film, Telluride Adaptive Sports Program, Telluride Repertory Theatre Company, Telluride Jewish Community and Investment Advisor to his Homeowner's Company. Stephen was always involved in giving back to the communities where he lived. In New York he was a founding Director of the New York Road Runners Club, Director Achilles Track Club, Director Outward Bound, New York Chapter, Director, University Hospital, Boston. He was an avid athlete, a longtime runner, finishing three New York City Marathons. He skied, played tennis and golf and was an enthusiastic biker. He and Sheila rode their bikes across the United States in 1999. He loved foreign travel and crossed the globe, taking many photos along the way. Photography was another passion of his. Above all he was devoted to the family and friends whom he loved. He was a people person in every sense of the expression. He will be greatly missed. The family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Telluride Foundation, 620 Mountain Village Boulevard, Telluride, CO 81435.

2009-10-25T00:00:00Z,"BOBRICK--Elizabeth Most (""Sherry""), died October 20, 2009 in New York City. Born Elizabeth Sharnoff on November 28, 1908 in Berdichev, Ukraine, she emigrated with her family to the United States in 1909. She won a two-year fellowship to the Jewish School of Social Work, married a journalist, Melos Most, traveled throughout Europe, and in 1939 became the first woman to bicycle across Greece. When World War II broke out, her husband became a wire correspondent for the Associated Press and Elizabeth joined the American Red Cross. The German invasion of France overtook them, and together they were held captive by the Germans in Baden-Baden for thirteen months. After the war, Elizabeth became a Welfare Officer for UNRRA in a displaced persons camp at Wiesbaden, Germany. When Eleanor Roosevelt visited the camp, Elizabeth gave her the tour. In 1949, she was divorced, worked for the Margaret Sanger Bureau and Planned Parenthood, was connected by her friendships with the Abstract Expressionist movement, earned her doctorate in Social Work from Columbia University, and subsequently taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of West Florida in Pensacola and at Southern University in New Orleans. When her contract was not renewed at the University of West Florida after she spoke out against the Vietnam War, she became the subject of a celebrated First Amendment rights case in which the university was sanctioned by the National Association of Social Workers. Meanwhile in 1962, she had married Robert L. Bobrick, a lawyer. Together, they helped found ""The National Committee for the Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon,"" which attracted attention worldwide. It also earned them a place on Nixon's ""Enemies List."" Elizabeth is survived by three stepsons, James, Robert Peter, and Benson Bobrick; and by numerous nieces and nephews and their children, and by all remembered with love."
2009-10-25T00:00:00Z,"At 6-0, this may be the greatest Minnesota Vikings team ever assembled, better than the 1998 flash in the pan that finished 15-1, better than the 1970s conference powerhouse that this team so closely resembles. The 1973-75 Vikings were led by an old daredevil quarterback (then Fran Tarkenton, now Brett Favre), a stalwart defensive line (the Purple People Eaters then, the law firm of Allen, Williams & Williams now), and a two-headed running game (Chuck Foreman and Ed Marinaro then, Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor running circles round them now). In 1974, the Vikings went 10-4, forced 33 turnovers and netted 4,611 yards of total offense, which is more than three miles when you adjust for inflation. They beat the Cardinals and the Rams en route to Super Bowl IX, which they lost to the Steelers. It's easy to overlook host Pittsburgh (4-2) as it goes about its business. The Colts and the Broncos have better records, but the Steelers are experienced marathoners more likely to peak in January than October. The Steelers are pressuring quarterbacks again -- 17 sacks after a slow start -- and although they are still having some problems with turnovers and special-teams mistakes, their offense is good enough to overcome the miscues. Ben Roethlisberger has no reason to envy Favre in their first-ever meeting. Favre has a higher passer rating right now, but Roethlisberger has twice as many Super Bowl rings."

Right now, many derivative deals are executed as private one-on-one contracts, outside the view of the public or regulators. This lack of transparency -- about participants, prices and volumes -- proved disastrous.

2009-10-25T00:00:00Z,"PEMBERTON--John de J. The American Civil Liberties Union mourns the passing of John de J. ""Jack"" Pemberton. Pemberton served as the national Executive Director of the ACLU from 1962-70, at the peak of the civil rights struggle and the escalation of the Vietnam War. Under Pemberton's leadership, the ACLU helped achieve victories in landmark cases such as Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage; Gideon v. Wainwright, which ensured felony defendants have the right to an attorney at trial; and Griswold v. Connecticut, which found that Americans have a constitutional right to privacy. Based on these successes and others, the ACLU doubled its membership under his stewardship. Pemberton followed his tenure at the ACLU as a distinguished leader in labor and employment law, serving as Acting General Counsel and Regional Attorney for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and as a law professor at the University of San Francisco (USF) School of Law from 1973-88. USF hosts an annual Pemberton Lecture on Workplace Justice in his honor. A passionate advocate of nonviolence and equality for all, Pemberton was instrumental in establishing the ACLU as a truly national organization through some of the most critical years in American civil rights history. The ACLU honors his legacy by continuing to be, in his words, ""a firm and steadfast guardian of the American ideal."" We extend our heartfelt condolences to Jack's family."

Two House committees have approved legislation, but -- after heavy lobbying from the banking industry and corporate America-- both versions are weak and unlikely to prevent another fiasco. Right now, many derivative deals are executed as private one-on-one contracts, outside the view of the public or regulators. This lack of transparency -- about participants, prices and volumes -- proved disastrous. In the bailout of American International Group, tens of billions of taxpayer dollars went to pay the world's biggest banks for derivative bets gone spectacularly wrong."

Though the supernumeraries (who also included the philanthropist Adrienne Arsht; Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s delegate to the House; and Justice Ginsburg’s husband, Professor Martin D. Ginsburg) did not sing or speak, Justice Scalia was treated to a special interaction with the Russian soprano Lyubov Petrova, who, in her portrayal of the character Zerbinetta, sat in the justice’s lap and put an arm around him. Both known opera buffs, the two justices also attended last year at an opera-themed luncheon held at the Supreme Court by the National Endowment for the Arts, and they previously appeared in the Washington National Opera’s 1994 production of “Die Fledermaus.”"

Two band members pulled him offstage, and he was taken to Great Western Hospital. In a statement, his publicists said, “Morrissey has now been released from hospital and is under doctors’ instruction to rest,” but they offered no additional details. Ticket-holders for both shows were told to await further news about new dates or possible refunds.

2009-10-26T11:52:11Z,"The 2009 Yankees are a playoff team with virtually no weaknesses, but if you had to pick an Achilles' heel, it would be their left-handed relief pitching. Phil Coke is little better than a stopgap, while Damaso Marte is a wild card, given how little he pitched in the regular season. Of course, Mariano Rivera himself has a pronounced reverse platoon split - he has allowed a combined on-base and slugging percentage of .598 to right-handed batters over his career, versus .517 for lefties - but Manager Joe Girardi certainly won't want to transform his best bullpen arm into a latter-day Mike Myers. If the Phillies are to repeat as champions, their victory scenario will almost surely involve Ryan Howard and Chase Utley doing serious damage against Marte and Coke in key spots."

Among the pieces on display will be the Cord chair, a wooden chair whose impossibly fragile appearance is made possible by an aluminum skeleton; the Blown-Fabric lamps, made from a new, nonwoven polyester fabric (first seen last April at the groundbreaking ""Senseware"" show in Milan), that can be inflated like a balloon; and the Fade-Out Chair, an acrylic chair with a faux wood finish that disappears toward the base of the legs, making it seem as if the chair is starting to vanish into thin air.

Melon or fat bomb at Prime Meats aside, Diner's Journal generally comes down for the diner-style griddled burger when it comes to questions surrounding New York's Best Hamburgers. A Sunday stop at the Five Guys outpost in Brooklyn Heights showed exactly why: a crisp exterior giving way to a mineral interior, with as much flavor coming from the mayonnaise, cheese, salt and fresh jalapeño as from the meat. (When it comes to burgers, the DJ is a toppings and condiments man, not a meat-nerd minimalist.) Fresh-cut, peanut-oil-fried potatoes? Yes, and there were more than enough of these to feed the Journal and his thieving brother. Five Guys does excellent fries: salty and firm. (Douse them in vinegar, not ketchup.) But the point was the burger -- canvas for the oils of its friends, a true in-and-out pleasure on its soft bun. Pretty great, the Journal declared, out in the sunshine of Montague Street. ""Yeah, and Panera is better than Subway,"" said his brother, affecting the wisdom of Buddha. There was braised organic bok choy for dinner that night, rice. Moderation in all things. Right?"

Although he's best known as a champion of contemporary art and design, de Pury has a long-standing interest in creating his own paintings, drawings and photographs. He observes that ""many curators and gallerists are also artists, but they tend to be very discreet about it. Thomas Krens [the former director of the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation] for instance, is a printmaker. I've always enjoyed making work, but I lead a very busy life, so it's not easy.

2009-10-26T00:00:00Z,"How do you solve a problem like ''La Damnation de Faust''? Berlioz's ''légende dramatique,'' inspired by Goethe's tragic play ''Faust,'' is among the highlights of that composer's oeuvre for its extraordinary music and visceral impact. From a dramatic perspective, though, the work is less a sustained narrative than a sequence of scenes vividly limned through beguiling melodies and brilliant orchestration. Robert Lepage's technologically groundbreaking production, created for the Metropolitan Opera last season and revived on Friday night, embraces that episodic quality. Working with the interactive-video designer Holger Förterer, Mr. Lepage offers dazzling images on a scaffoldlike set that doubles as a colossal video screen. Grassy fields ripple as soldiers march up the set; demons madly clamber across it, and projected sprites writhe in smoky tendrils on its surfaces."

2009-10-26T00:00:00Z,"ANTHONY--Dee. Legendary music manager and impresario Dee Anthony, who guided the careers of artists as diverse as Tony Bennett, Peter Frampton and Peter Allen passed away today, October 25, 2009 in Connecticut. He was 83 years old. During a career that spanned over 50 years, Anthony was a seminal figure in the music industry, whose managerial skills helped pave the way and set new standards for rock music. He first gained major prominence when rock and roll began to take off during the mid-1960's. Anthony led the charge in the United States by introducing to the American audience a host of fledgling young British rock bands, such as Traffic, Jethro Tull, Joe Cocker, Free, Spooky Tooth, Mott the Hoople, Savoy Brown and King Crimson, breaking them into headliner status as well as establishing many of those artists in the pantheon of rock. Anthony started his career as a personal manager in the music industry in the 1950s, working with a young Jerry Vale, a neighborhood friend. In 1954, Anthony met singer Tony Bennett at a Yonkers nightclub and went on to represent Bennett for well over the next decade. In 1968, Anthony, with his brother Bill, founded Bandana Enterprises, a global management company that sheparded the careers of artists such as Joe Cocker, Humble Pie, The J Geils Band, MC5, Ten Years After, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. But it would be Anthony's management of musician Peter Frampton that would cement his legendary status in the music industry. Anthony first met Frampton while managing Humble Pie, of which Frampton was a member. When Frampton left the band to pursue a solo career, Anthony continued to manage him, helping to launch one of the most successful solo careers of the 1970s. The double album, ""Frampton Comes Alive,"" would shatter industry records, eventually selling more than 14 million copies worldwide. Anthony would also receive praise from his industry peers, being named ""Billboard Manager of the Year"" in 1976 and 1977. During the 1980s, Anthony continued to manage music artists including Peter Allen, Basia, and Devo. Anthony retired from the business in the mid-1990s. Dee Anthony, was born Anthony D'Addario and grew up in the Bronx. In 1944, he joined the Navy serving in the submarine force. During his three years of service he was decorated with three medals-- the Victory Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Medal and the American Theater Medal. Anthony then returned to New York City, opened a luncheonette, and followed his passion for show business. Anthony is survived by his wife, Valerie, four daughters, Michele, Marla, Vanessa and Jessica, two brothers, Bill Anthony and Bobby D'Addario, sister Tina Cursio, and six grandchildren, Jack, Charlotte, Olivia, Joey, Dylan, and Chase. Anthony's daughter, Michele has carried on the family business. During her career she became the highest-ranking female record company executive as the President and COO of Sony Music. Currently she is a music industry consultant, whose clients have included Pearl Jam, Bjork, Macy Gray, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, and Prince. A visitation will be held on Wednesday, October 28th from 6-9 pm and a memorial service will be held on Thursday, October 29th at 11am both at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in New York City. In lieu of flowers, please send donations in Dee Anthony's name to ""Wounded Warrior Regiment"", C/O Charitable Organizations, 3025 John Quick Road, Quantico, VA 22134."
2009-10-26T00:00:00Z,"Inheriting a series from a venerable ensemble like the Guarneri String Quartet must be daunting for a relatively young quartet, but it is also a great opportunity. The Pacifica Quartet finds itself in that position, having just taken over the berth at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that the newly retired Guarneri held for 43 seasons. But despite their youthful looks and energetic performances, the Pacifica players are not novices: they have worked together since 1994, which means that the group is far more seasoned than the Guarneri was when it first performed at the Met. In its introductory program, on Saturday evening, the group seemed intent on demonstrating its flexibility. In Mozart's Quartet No. 19 in C (K. 465) it produced a dark sound and played with unusual restraint, as if anything louder than a mezzo forte would shatter the work. Still, the ensemble's expressive range was striking: the Dvorak-like warmth of the Andante cantabile proved a stark contrast to both the strained, ghostly dissonances of the work's opening Adagio and the cheerful briskness of the finale."

For its exploration of Beethoven's string quartets, which began last season at the 92nd Street Y, the Tokyo String Quartet has organized the works by early, middle and late periods and set them off against piano sonatas from the same time frames. On Friday at the 92nd Street Y, quartets from Beethoven's middle period (around 1803 to 1814) were programmed with his Piano Sonata in C, the ''Waldstein,'' performed by the young pianist Inon Barnatan."

2009-10-27T00:00:00Z,"HERBICH--Barbara Kathleen, 55, of New York passed away on October 17, 2009, in New York City. Services are set for 1pm Wednesday, October 28, at St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Bryan, Texas. Barbara was the daughter of John Bronislaw Herbich (1922-2008), who fled his native Poland during WWII and was a world-renowned ocean engineer, and Margaret Pauline (Boylan) Herbich. A 1972 Bryan High School graduate who studied journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, she attended University of Strasbourg in France. In 1977, she received her Bachelor of Arts in French literature from UT and then moved to New York and received her Master of Arts degree from Columbia University as a President's Fellow. Her passion for her Polish heritage was ignited when she visited Poland in 1970 with her father and frequently returned to Poland to organize conferences and consult on emerging entrepreneurship in the Eastern bloc. At the time of her death, she was working on two films: a rough cut of a documentary about the persecution of Polish priests by the Third Reich, and another film devoted to the destruction of the Polish intelligentsia under the Nazi occupation. Her films tackled important political and historical topics, giving them a nuanced, human face. ""Stitch for Time"" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1988 and a later film, ""USSR Art,"" documented the groundbreaking Sotheby's auction of Russian avant-garde and contemporary underground art held in Moscow in 1988. Both were aired on PBS stations. An indefatigable, creative personality with a good sense of humor and finely-honed flare for self-irony, Barbara is survived by her mother, Margaret (Boylan) Herbich; brother, Gregory; sister, Patricia Herbich O'Connor; and nieces, Kaya O'Connor and Aleksandra Herbich.

Pini Gershon, the head coach of Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv, became the subject of headlines and punchlines after he refused to leave the court after being ejected from an exhibition loss to the Knicks. Gershon, who caused a 10-minute delay in the game on Oct. 18, said in a letter sent to Commissioner David Stern and Donnie Walsh, the Knicks' president, ''Our trip to the U.S. was for a wonderful cause -- the children of Migdal Ohr -- and hopefully a few minutes of bad behavior on my behalf won't detract from all the good that was accomplished by our spirited competition with the Knicks and the Clippers.''"

Favre will protest that these games do not really mean much to him, but consider this: when the Vikings hosted the Packers a few weeks ago, Favre broke from his routine of going on the field early to throw the ball around and chat up his buddies from the other team. Favre is such a world-class schmoozer that when Steve Mariucci took the San Francisco 49ers into Lambeau Field to play the Packers years ago, Favre stopped throwing his warm-up passes, walked over to Mariucci and 49ers quarterback Steve Young, and said, ''Let's take a picture,'' Mariucci recalled, adding: ''So the three of us took pictures.''"

Legendary music manager and impresario Dee Anthony, who guided the careers of artists as diverse as Tony Bennett, Peter Frampton and Peter Allen passed away today, October 25, 2009 in Connecticut. He was 83 years old. During a career that spanned over 50 years, Anthony was a seminal figure in the music industry, whose managerial skills helped pave the way and set new standards for rock music. He first gained major prominence when rock and roll began to take off during the mid-1960's. Anthony led the charge in the United States by introducing to the American audience a host of fledgling young British rock bands, such as Traffic, Jethro Tull, Joe Cocker, Free, Spooky Tooth, Mott the Hoople, Savoy Brown and King Crimson, breaking them into headliner status as well as establishing many of those artists in the pantheon of rock. Anthony started his career as a personal manager in the music industry in the 1950s, working with a young Jerry Vale, a neighborhood friend. In 1954, Anthony met singer Tony Bennett at a Yonkers nightclub and went on to represent Bennett for well over the next decade. In 1968, Anthony, with his brother Bill, founded Bandana Enterprises, a global management company that sheparded the careers of artists such as Joe Cocker, Humble Pie, The J Geils Band, MC5, Ten Years After, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. But it would be Anthony's management of musician Peter Frampton that would cement his legendary status in the music industry. Anthony first met Frampton while managing Humble Pie, of which Frampton was a member. When Frampton left the band to pursue a solo career, Anthony continued to manage him, helping to launch one of the most successful solo careers of the 1970s. The double album, ""Frampton Comes Alive,"" would shatter industry records, eventually selling more than 14 million copies worldwide. Anthony would also receive praise from his industry peers, being named ""Billboard Manager of the Year"" in 1976 and 1977. During the 1980s, Anthony continued to manage music artists including Peter Allen, Basia, and Devo. Anthony retired from the business in the mid-1990s. Dee Anthony, was born Anthony D'Addario and grew up in the Bronx. In 1944, he joined the Navy serving in the submarine force. During his three years of service he was decorated with three medals-- the Victory Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Medal and the American Theater Medal. Anthony then returned to New York City, opened a luncheonette, and followed his passion for show business. Anthony is survived by his wife, Valerie, four daughters, Michele, Marla, Vanessa and Jessica, two brothers, Bill Anthony and Bobby D'Addario, sister Tina Cursio, and six grandchildren, Jack, Charlotte, Olivia, Joey, Dylan, and Chase. Anthony's daughter, Michele has carried on the family business. During her career she became the highest-ranking female record company executive as the President and COO of Sony Music. Currently she is a music industry consultant, whose clients have included Pearl Jam, Bjork, Macy Gray, Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, and Prince. A visitation will be held on Wednesday, October 28th from 6-9 pm and a memorial service will be held on Thursday, October 29th at 11am both at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in New York City.

They certainly still evoke the voluptuousness of the East, perhaps because it was Bakst who invented the East - or at least our image of it - having put an ethnocentric gloss on the Orient as promiscuous as any fashion designer's."

He is 49 and, with his wife, raises alpacas on ancestral farmland. The Coolidge family has been in Jay since the early 1800s, so his distinctive name does not seem to faze neighbors. The only time Mr. Coolidge recalls encountering any doubt about his identity was when he was trying to make a collect call. This composition, with an alpaca named Tracey Lynn, recalls a 1931 photograph of President Coolidge, after he left office, on his farm in Vermont. (The names of the photographer, and of the horse, are unknown.)"

While The Times indeed paid fines of $285,000 at one point, it was refunded $100,000 of that money after the newspaper and Mr. Farber were pardoned in 1982 by the governor of New Jersey; the paper did not ultimately pay $285,000 in fines."

But not in the front parlor of the Homestead, her house in Amherst, Mass., which is now part of the Emily Dickinson Museum. Part of the ceiling there collapsed on Sunday afternoon while the house was open for tours. No one was in the parlor at the time, and no one in the house was hurt, though some of the Dickinson family furniture and belongings on display there, including a sofa and a teapot, may have been harmed. The mess has still not been cleaned up, Jane H. Ward, the executive director of the museum, said on Tuesday, because the museum is waiting for a complete inspection to determine what went wrong. The ceiling that fell is not original to the house, Ms. Ward explained — the plaster was laid over wire mesh, not lath — and was probably installed in the 1960s, when the house was privately owned. For once, an overflowing tub was not to blame. “It appears that the plaster just detached itself from the wall,” Ms. Ward said, “but we won’t really know the extent of the damage until the inspection is completed.” For now the museum is closed at least through Friday, and Ms. Ward said she hoped in the next couple of days to determine when it can reopen and what to do about repairs."

It was just interleague play, of course, hardly revenge for the previous sweep by the Yankees in the 1950 World Series, over the Whiz Kids of Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. The teams have shadow-danced for years since then, never reuniting in the World Series until now."

2009-10-29T00:00:00Z,"BALANCE bikes, long popular in Europe, are making inroads in the United States as a way to teach children to ride a two-wheel bicycle without the need for training wheels. The bikes do not have pedals; instead, toddlers use their feet to steady themselves, propel forward and brake. Eventually they learn to coast -- and balance. Technically, the bikes are ride-on toys, because they lack gears. But they do look like small bicycles, with rubber tires, adjustable seats and adjustable handlebars (on the metal-frame ones, at least). All are low to the ground, so that diminutive riders can straddle them while standing on both feet."

By the end of the siege, at least five United Nations employees, two Afghan security officials and the brother-in-law of a prominent Afghan politician were dead, as were their three attackers. But the story of how the rest of the people in the Bakhtar guesthouse had survived was one of courage -- particularly by several United Nations security guards, one of them an American identified by survivors as Max, who held off the attackers for about an hour."

What these images from the new short film ""LX Forty,"" released to promote Swiss International Airlines' revamped first-class cabin, have to do with adjustable-firmness flat-bed seats and 23-inch high-def TVs is a Delphic secret known only by the film's maker, Marc Forster, better known for movies like ""Monster's Ball"" and ""The Kite Runner."" Not quite a commercial and not truly a short film, ""LX Forty"" is the airline's latest bid to align the company with cultural tastemakers.

The video is a utopian romp through Forster's mind, which is apparently filled with cinder blocks and butterflies and Khalil Gibran-like ducats of wisdom. One such self-narrated axiom goes, ""There are two types of lies we are living. Lies we tell ourselves and lies we tell others. Love is the only answer I have found that carries any truth.""

2009-10-31T00:00:00Z,"LEVY--Michael B. The lawyers and staff of the law firm Bryan Cave LLP mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague Michael B. Levy, partner for over 30 years at Bryan Cave and our predecessor firm Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn & Berman. A nationally prominent real estate and banking lawyer, Michael touched every constituency of the firm, lawyers and staff alike. He was a valued counselor to his many clients in the finest and most complete sense of that term. Michael was diagnosed with lung cancer seven years ago and given six months to live. Typical of his passion as a lawyer, he simply refused to surrender to his illness, showed consistent courage and determination and would not allow the disease to interfere with his career and life. His will to live was a source of enormous inspiration to his friends and colleagues. Michael was extraordinarily proud of the accomplishments of his two children - Stacey and Spencer - and was close to them both. He loved golf, his practice, his clients, his friends and life in all its parts. To be in his presence was never a passive experience, and we will miss him greatly. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY 10023, at 11am on Sunday, November 1. The Levy family has asked that donations be directed to Lung Research Center, c/o Dr. Mark Stoopler, Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, 9th Floor, Room 936, New York, NY 10032. Bryan Cave LLP."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"I came to Iraq three days after Saddam Hussein fled Baghdad. It was April 12, 2003. At the time, Iraqis bristled when asked if they were Sunni, Shiite or Kurd. It made no difference, they said, they were brothers. And, in the heady aftermath of the war, for a short while it almost seemed true. That mood seems to be upon the country again, and it is most welcome after the last six years of bloody murders between Shiites and Sunnis; between Arabs and Kurds; between Muslims and Christians. Will it last? Or are Americans, as they have been in Kosovo and Bosnia and perhaps now in Afghanistan, turning away from the inconvenient realities of ethnic and religious differences, the depth of animosities, of struggles for power and territory? As the country's attention turns east to Afghanistan, I too have made the journey to Kabul, as my new assignment. It is tempting to make analogies between the two troubled places, and there are some, but there are at least as many differences."

Jazic has preferred to stay with his girlfriend. Perhaps, in the interest of cohabitational harmony -- as well as good health -- this arrangement is all for the best."
2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"''Are we going to give up in South Vietnam?'' That was the question President Kennedy posed, then tried to answer, in what would be his final news conference in 1963. ''The most important program, of course, is our national security. But I don't want the United States to have to put troops there.'' Kennedy was killed eight days later, giving rise not just to 40 years of grassy-knoll conspiracy theories but also to a lingering debate over whether he might have averted his successor's tragic plunge into the jungles of Southeast Asia. Kennedy came to public life as a staunch anti-Communist, but his experiences as president -- most notably the failed invasion of Cuba and the perilous standoff over Russia's missiles there -- reinforced in him a natural skepticism of go-get-'em generals and armchair extremism. In a 1995 memoir, a repentant Robert McNamara at last concluded that Kennedy most likely ''would have pulled us out of Vietnam.'' For liberals of a certain age, this is a comforting version of history, because it places some reassuring distance between the president who first inspired their idealism and the war that shattered it. The left would prefer not to believe that modern American liberalism, defined by an unshakable faith in the social justice and antiwar movements, derived from a martyred hero whose commitment to both causes was, in fact, considerably more nuanced."

Jorge Posada, thinking it was a ground ball, ran from first to second."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"Many seaside towns make much of their location. Their shops are gussied up with nautical décor -- rigging, buoys, mounted fish -- and their restaurants often have the word ''captain'' in the name. The Brooklyn enclave of Sheepshead Bay avoids this waterfront kitsch. Yes, there are boats and bait shops and plenty of fishing, but there are also historical monuments and retro restaurants, all played out against the backdrop of the neighborhood's sometimes grimy, sometimes gorgeous bay. NOON Exit the B or Q train at the Sheepshead Bay station and eat lunch the way Benjamin Wolk, a local nonagenarian, has nearly every day for the past nine years: with a roast beef sandwich ($4.45) from Roll N Roaster, 2901 Emmons Avenue, (718) 769-6000. Although the restaurant has had five expansions over its four decades, its tent-covered eaves still sport the brown and tan palette popular in the 1970s. Its cuisine seems of another era, too. A sign reads: ''You can have cheez on anything you pleez'': in a cup (90 cents) or on top of your sandwich (45 cents). Felipe Marin, 24, a manager, said some customers have requested the bright yellow cheese sauce on their apple pie."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"For Vivienne Pacquette, being a combat veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder means avoiding phone calls to her sons, dinner out with her husband and therapy sessions that make her talk about seeing the reds and whites of her friends' insides after a mortar attack in 2004. As with other women in her position, hiding seems to make sense. Post-traumatic stress disorder distorts personalities: some veterans who have it fight in their sleep; others feel paranoid around children. And as women return to a society unfamiliar with their wartime roles, they often choose isolation over embarrassment."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"Nicholas Hoult: 'A Single Man' The English actor Nicholas Hoult has been working in film and television since he was 6. American audiences may know him for his role as Marcus, the put-upon, round-cheeked 12-year-old who tenderized Hugh Grant's heartless playboy in the 2002 romantic comedy ''About a Boy.'' Since then, thanks to snagging the alpha male role in the hugely popular teenagers-gone-wild British television series ''Skins,'' he has become a certified heartthrob at home. A midnight skinny-dipping scene in the designer Tom Ford's drama ''A Single Man'' (Dec. 11) suggests one reason why. Mr. Hoult is now a lithe, graceful 6-foot-3, and along the way that formerly chubby face has acquired dramatic cheekbones, a lush lower lip, sparkling deep-blue eyes and thick eyebrows that shoot up so sharply that he looks a bit like an alien, albeit a very handsome one."

Today, he announced, he was depressed. ''I am a writer. I have books to write. What am I doing building a museum?'' His voice rose in a crescendo to escape being drowned out by folkloric music coming from a passing cruise ship. A stuffed bird, perched to his left, peered down at the bookish debris below, giving the impression that the writer was addressing the handsome, ill-fated gull. Scattered around the room was the raw material of the museum-to-be: salt shakers, porcelain figurines, irregularly shaped doorknobs, lottery tickets, a quince grinder. The words ''never forget the objects as you write'' were written in Turkish in capital letters across a little yellow Post-it. He looked stressed. He had lectures to deliver at Harvard in the fall. He hadn't gotten far into his next novel. He had dreamed of taking a vacation with his new love, the novelist Kiran Desai. The music from the Love Boat got still louder. He winced."

Still, if you want to teach your children more about Mumbai's history and culture, there are plenty of good options. At Mani Bhavan (19 Laburnum Road, Gamdevi; 91-22-2380-5864; www.gandhi-manibhavan.org), once Gandhi's home, children can see the room where the leader worked -- along with his sandals, spectacles, spinning wheel, bed and drinking bowl.

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"As the New York City mayor's race enters its final, combative stretch, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his opponent, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., have unleashed a flood of advertisements that contain distorted, misleading and, in some cases, outright false claims about everything from the creation of jobs to plans for tax increases. With many New Yorkers just beginning to tune in to what has been a late-blooming campaign, the truth-stretching -- in TV commercials, Web advertisements and mailed brochures -- could be the primary exposure they have to the two candidates."

He helped the Cornhuskers win three national titles, was an all-American as a center and a guard and won the Outland Trophy as the nation's best interior lineman in 1997. It took about 30 minutes Saturday for him to lose possession of some of the tangible evidence of his accomplishments. Taylor's Outland Trophy and his seven championship rings were sold at a court-ordered auction, after the failure of his Cornhuskers-themed restaurant in Omaha and his subsequent bankruptcy. According to The Associated Press, the trophy sold for $6,800, and the diamond-encrusted rings sold for $2,000 to $5,900. Bids were accepted in person and online. The auction brought in $28,500, the A.P. reported."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"WHAT does a swimming tiger suggest about public policy, or a pricked finger say about your goals? The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University is showing applicants two dozen conceptual photos, and giving them the option of basing an essay on one of them. The photo album was created by the Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit group that produces visual tools to prompt conversations at leadership training seminars. Wagner is putting the concept to unusual use as an admissions tool. ''It allows us to get a deeper sense of the applicant's passion for/commitment to an issue, and unlocks the depth of interest in a way that is not always achievable in a standard admissions essay,'' says Tracey Gardner, Wagner's chief of staff. Another benefit: no more essays rehashed from other applications. About 970 applicants for this fall's class, more than half, wrote on an image.

And, well, fashion insiders are sold: The models Kate Moss, Claudia Schiffer and Eva Herzigova are all big fans; the makeup artists Diane Kendal and Tom Pecheux carry it in their bags.

In flashbacks more than 40 years earlier, Lee Ingleby plays George Bennett, a high-level police official whose career took off with the case and who is now the subject of Catherine's latest documentary. Philip Jackson is George as an older man. Greg Wise, above with Ms. Stevenson, plays the girl's arrogant stepfather; Tony Maudsley is George's garrulous sergeant; and Elizabeth Day is Catherine's rebel daughter, who can't stand her mother but is fascinated by her project. Then there are the suspects: a schoolmate (Mikey North) who had secretly kept photographs of the victim, and the victim's uncle (Ryan Anthony-Jones), a known sexual offender.

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"JOHN HILLCOAT's post-apocalyptic drama ''The Road'' (Nov. 25) is based on Cormac McCarthy's most parablelike novel, with its leading characters, a father and a son, known only as The Man and The Boy. It's a challenge for any actor to infuse an emblematic figure with specific, detailed life, but the astonishingly sure-footed Kodi Smit-McPhee, who was 11 at the time of shooting, makes it look effortless -- or as effortless as this grueling story allows. Playing alongside Viggo Mortensen, as the loving father who persists in instilling in his son a sense of ethics in the face of savagery, he becomes the moral pivot on which the movie turns. Father and son make their way across a ruined landscape where civilization and nature itself seem long dead and gangs of predators live off the flesh of less hardy or rapacious survivors, including children. This is the only world The Boy has ever known, and it's terrifying. And yet, although the movie opens with his high, panicked cry, ''Papa, Papa,'' as the earth rumbles under their feet, Kodi keeps melodrama at bay with a clarity and restraint that make The Boy a fascinating paradox. He is at once the steadiest and most vulnerable figure in a setting so wildly violent it makes social Darwinism look like a minuet."

This year, a crystal spider web glitters in one of Bergdorf Goodman's Fifth Avenue windows, and pumpkins fill the wrought-iron balconies of a Gramercy Park town house. Last week, guests wigged out for the Central Park Conservancy's Twilight ball. Among the prizewinners were the couple at left; she's in a custom-designed spider-web gown and headdress."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"The great American holiday is Thanksgiving, and the great Thanksgiving movie is ''Planes, Trains and Automobiles.'' After writing and directing the '80s comedies my generation can still quote from memory (''Sixteen Candles,'' ''The Breakfast Club,'' ''Weird Science'' and ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off''), John Hughes turned his camera away from the adolescents of suburban Chicago and onto their fathers. The story here could not be simpler: Steve Martin is Neal Page, a successful marketing man trying to make it home for the holiday. Everything conspires against him, from God to Kevin Bacon. Neal is a Job with no patience. Every slight is a mortal wound. Every piece of bad luck brings on a new round of grimaces, eye rolling and impotent fury. Every scene contains some fresh insult, but whenever he tries to defend himself he ends up in worse straits. After he drops 18 F-bombs on an unhelpful rental car agent, she smiles sweetly and destroys him with a 19th. When he comes up with a decent retort for an equally unhelpful cab dispatcher, he's punched out and hoisted off the pavement by his scrotum."

A nationally prominent real estate and banking lawyer, Michael touched every constituency of the firm, lawyers and staff alike. He was a valued counselor to his many clients in the finest and most complete sense of that term. Michael was diagnosed with lung cancer seven years ago and given six months to live. Typical of his passion as a lawyer, he simply refused to surrender to his illness, showed consistent courage and determination and would not allow the disease to interfere with his career and life. His will to live was a source of enormous inspiration to his friends and colleagues. Michael was extraordinarily proud of the accomplishments of his two children - Stacey and Spencer - and was close to them both. He loved golf, his practice, his clients, his friends and life in all its parts. To be in his presence was never a passive experience, and we will miss him greatly. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York, NY 10023, at 11am on Sunday, November 1.

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"DURING a celebrity-packed party at the Hamptons International Film Festival last month, Anna Kendrick responded modestly to a question about the musical talent that brought her a Tony nomination for her work in the Broadway production of ''High Society'' when she was 12. Five years later, it won her the part of Fredrika in the New York City Opera's ''Little Night Music.'' Now 24, Ms. Kendrick has been concentrating on her film career, although in her biggest movie yet, Jason Reitman's ''Up in the Air'' (Dec. 4), she gets to sing too, after a fashion. In person Ms. Kendrick is tiny and adorable-looking, but on-screen she's no softy. In Mr. Reitman's dark-edged new comedy, which plays out amid the ravages of the current recession, she is hilarious and scary as Natalie, a ferociously perky young professional so hellbent on success that her game plan resembles an obsessive-compulsive disorder. As Ryan and Alex, business travelers who like spending more time in airport hotels than in their homes, George Clooney (below with Ms. Kendrick) and Vera Farmiga are the suave, witty headliners. They put the romance in this film, but it's Ms. Kendrick's job to supply the belly laughs."

2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,THE BOAT DWELLER
2009-11-01T00:00:00Z,"''The Ice Storm'' is the sort of holiday film that makes you never want to go home again. Though Thanksgiving is the reason for the return of the young protagonist (Tobey Maguire) from boarding school to suburban Connecticut, where his stilted parents (Joan Allen and Kevin Kline) and ironist younger sister (Christina Ricci, near right, with Mr. Kline and Ms. Allen) wait for him in their nest of noncommunication, the meal itself is a desultory affair. The real nourishment in this 1997 film is not what's bringing two families linked by adultery and teenage lust together, but what's pulling them apart: alienation, selfishness and spiritual bankruptcy. This doesn't sound like a barrel of laughs, I know, but it's deeply satisfying to watch characters drawn with such excruciating vividness get lost in the 1970s, ushering in the holidays with a ''key'' party where wives (Sigourney Weaver is unforgettable as a bored adulteress) and husbands gamely swish off in each others' Oldsmobiles as their children fumble naked and unsupervised under duvets, wander around in Nixon masks, whip rosebushes and electrocute themselves while observing natural phenomena. In fact, this film is not just set in the '70s, its deadpan tone echoes that great nonmanipulative period in American filmmaking when ''Taking Off'' and ''Shampoo,'' among others, embodied a warm satire, which is now very rare. Yet ''The Ice Storm,'' directed by Ang Lee, has an edge, an irony, a sharpness, that belongs to our own, more jaded time. Ice is a motif used throughout, not just in the weather: turkeys, ice cubes and hearts all need thawing in this strangely eerie film. I went to see it at the Angelika twice in two days when it came out. I thought it was pitch-perfect, just the right balance of pleasure and pain -- all you can ask of any holiday."

It is enjoyable to look at, but rather difficult to understand, because the curator, Kevin Sharp, seems to have been too ambitious by half: With fewer than 60 works, he has sought to convey the story of American art and society during the Civil War era."

In Germany, it's just another show that nobody watches.

The channel, which is owned by the German broadcaster ZDF, was recently given a makeover in an attempt to attract more young male viewers, and its showings of ""30 Rock"" (along with series like ""Miami Vice"" and ""The Sentinel"") were central to that mission.

Three undefeated teams entered the weekend, along with 11 teams that had two or fewer victories. But near the midpoint of the season, the N.F.L. took a few tentative steps toward reverting to form. What we learned from Week 8: TITANS UNSETTLED DESPITE WIN The Tennessee Titans finally won Sunday, and even if their season is beyond saving, at least Vince Young, the former third overall draft pick, may have been salvaged. The Titans have a pricey decision to make after this season about Young's future -- and the team's owner, Bud Adams, has a decision to make about Coach Jeff Fisher. After Sunday, Young's future might be brighter than Fisher's. Adams essentially ordered Fisher to start Young, who completed 15 of 18 passes for 125 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 30 yards on 12 carries. As much of a boost as that is for Young (Adams has always been a fan), it is an indictment of Fisher, who resisted the move and wanted to keep Kerry Collins at quarterback."

According to BBC News, an anonymous bidder bought the 71 pages of letters and fragments, dating from 1808, which include details of an affair with a servant girl and a disparaging reference to William Wordsworth. The documents came from the library of Archibald Primrose, prime minister from 1894 to 1895. Gabriel Heaton, a Sotheby's specialist in British literature and history, told the BBC that the letters, to Byron's close friend the Rev. Francis Hodgson, ''offered a wonderful opportunity to reveal aspects of Lord Byron's character that were either unknown or long forgotten.''"

''You can't deny that,'' she continues in an agonized, breathless mumble. ''You can, but you'd be affirming what you're arguing against, and what would the point of that be? No point.'' This irrefutable bit of logic is among the more clear-eyed moments in this mordantly funny, weirdly transfixing play. And while the need to speak may be a natural inheritance, for some people it is much more. Breda and her sister Clara chatter away to convince themselves they are alive, but also to avoid truly living. ''There's a terrible lull in the conversation,'' Clara says with a squirm when the chatter stops. ''The sort of lull that can get you worrying about other things.'' It's an observation Samuel Beckett would surely approve."

In New Jersey, the race between Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Christopher J. Christie, his Republican challenger, appears to be very tight, according to the latest polls. When an independent candidate, Christopher J. Daggett, is included, he receives 8 percent to 20 percent of the support of likely voters.

When Halcyon purchased the ""Terminator"" property for $30 million in 2007, it became the latest in a series of owners that previously included the producer Gale Anne Hurd and the now-defunct production company Carolco. Though the latest entry in the film series, ""Terminator: Salvation,"" grossed $369 million worldwide on budget of $200 million, Halcyon filed suit in August against a hedge fund that had provided the money to buy the series rights, saying that a backer at the fund engaged in fraudulent dealings, and filed for Chapter 11 in September. The company's founders, Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek, told a bankruptcy court that the ""Terminator"" franchise was worth $70 million. In a satirical blog post, Joss Whedon, the creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" said he would pay $10,000 for the series, proposing such new ideas as a ""Terminator of the Rings"" fantasy film and a ""Terminator"" musical."

2009-11-03T07:59:00Z,"Former Vice President Al Gore's third book centering on global warming is out. Titled ""Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis,"" it centers on the same mantra at the core of his message for years now - that the only missing link holding back action is political will. The book is mainly a heavily illustrated guide to the technologies and policies that could, in Mr. Gore's view, limit climate dangers. Nuclear is largely out, capturing and burying carbon dioxide is somewhat in. Gains in energy efficiency are a vital stepping stone, he says, along with vastly expanded deployment of renewable energy sources and improved storage and grid components to make sure the power is available where and when it's needed."

2009-11-03T07:02:30Z,"""I went to see Madonna's dress rehearsal at the O2 arena in London. It was so boring because she didn't make any mistakes,"" announced Casey Spooner, one part of the electroclash (remember that?) duo Fischerspooner onstage at MoMA on Sunday evening as part of Performa 2009. ""Between the Worlds,"" the group's three-hour performance supporting their newest album, ""Entertainment,"" celebrated the imperfections and rawness of a dress rehearsal. The audience literally entered through the back stage, getting a close-up of the dancers shimmying into their different D.I.Y. showgirl outfits: leotards accessorized with colorful knee pads, ripped-up gowns and silver running suits that looked liked they were issued from NASA.But it was Spooner who stole the show with his getups - from corsets to Kabuki - and his snarky running commentary. The singer arrived onstage in a bolero jacket and slicked back platinum hair - for a band that seems stuck in the '80s, this seemed to be a subtle homage to Adam Ant. As he serpentined through his dancers, a veritable hall of mirrors and racks of clothes, he faced the room full of arty hipsters as if he were making his debut to a crowd of 50,000 at the Meadowlands. In fact, the whole performance, snafus and all, was about superstardom. There was the de rigueur talk of the current queen of all things pop, Lady Gaga, and of course the former king of pop, Michael Jackson - at one point Spooner changed into a silver sequined suit and black hat, looking like he stepped out of the ""This Is It"" documentary."

BBC News reported that 93 percent of the 250 local residents who participated in the vote, which ended on Saturday, said that the Sutton Council should keep the work that appeared on a wall this fall: a painting of a punk with spiky hair trying to assemble a slogan from the contents of a box branded with an Ikea-like name. Though the council generally has a zero-tolerance policy on graffiti, Councilor Colin Hall told the BBC: “We believe in democracy and wanted local people to decide what should happen to the Banksy. Sadly someone decided to take it into their own hands.” He added: “The image actually criticized mindless graffiti, so perhaps it isn’t surprising that the sort of people who do that sort of thing should attack it.”."

In a news release the auction house Freeman’s, which conducted the sale, top right, in Philadelphia, said that all 280 lots offered, consisting of works from Lehman Brothers offices in New York, Massachusetts and Delaware, were sold. Among the top sellers were a Roy Lichtenstein “I Love Liberty” print, which brought $49,000; a set of 10 prints by Louis Lozowick, which went for $94,000; and a Georges Schreiber painting of Manhattan’s financial district for $20,000. (All sales figures include a 25 percent buyer’s premium on the first $20,000 of the hammer price and an additional 20 percent on the balance.)

Tens of millions of people, or about 40 percent of all private-sector workers, do not receive paid sick days, and as a result many of them cannot afford to stay home when they are ill. Even some companies that provide paid sick days have policies that make it difficult to call in sick, like giving demerits each time someone misses a day."

As they lounged in their clubhouse, rolls of protective plastic wrap hung above their lockers. As party planners, the Yankees were prepared for a celebration. But the Philadelphia Phillies did not let it happen. They overwhelmed A. J.

In the process, he may be clearing a path forward for himself and his much-maligned sport. This may go down as the season that the fans forgave baseball -- or perhaps just grew tired of worrying about performance-enhancing drugs.

2009-11-03T00:00:00Z,"READ--Alexander ""Sandy"", on Thursday, October 29th, died happily at The Equinox Terrace in Manchester, Vermont. Sandy enjoyed the whole thing, starting with his birth in Boston in 1928. One of nine children of Vice Admiral William A. Read USNR and Edith Fabyan Read, he grew up in Purchase, New York, attended The Browning School in New York City, and graduated from St. Pauls's and Yale, majoring in Hockey. After a few weeks of active duty in the United States Marine Corps, he spent 18 years as a member of the New York Stock Exchange, eight with DeCoppet and Doremus and ten as a partner in Spear, Leeds and Kellogg. During this time, he played hockey on the side for the St. Nicks and Beaver Dam teams. He retired in 1971 and moved to Peru, Vermont full time from Mill Neck, New York, with his wife Signa Lynch, whom he married in 1950. There he raised sheep, drew cartoons, and was a serious hunter and fisherman. He continued his interest in hockey as a part owner of The Buffalo Sabres and coaching the Brattleboro squirt team for several years. He took an active interest in politics and served Winhall as a Grand Juror, planner and selectman. After his divorce in 1986, he moved to Landgrove and then East Dorset, where he continued cartooning with his second wife, Patricia Wood Read, who predeceased him in 2005. He perpetuated his political career in Dorset by serving as a selectman for a number of years. In 2007, he remarried his first wife, Signa Lynch Read, who survives him. He is also survived by four of his seven brothers, Peter B. Read of Jaffrey, NH, Donald, B. Read of Old Lyme, CT, William A. Read, Jr. of Palm Beach, FL, Frederick H. Read of Malibu, CA, his sister, Jean R. Knox of Williamsville, NY, and his children, Sandra Read of Dorset, VT, Susan Read Cronin, of Manchester, VT, and Stewart W. Read of Bellows Falls, VT, two step-daughters, Marci MacNeur of Manchester, VT and Mindy Schwartz of Silver Springs, MD, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, as well as a large assortment of nieces and nephews, distributed nationally. He was a member of a whole pile of fancy clubs, where he drank copiously, and at his death was still a member of The Brook in New York City, and Mory's and Delta Kappa Epsilon at Yale. He was the author and illustrator of several books, including The Bear with the Orvis Rod and was a scrimshawer of note, with over three hundred pieces of work. His cartoons are found all over the world, and he will be remembered for his humor and his favorite saying, ""There's a buck in every disaster!"" Following his cremation, his ashes will be hauled to his favorite places. There will be no service at his request. ""Bear"" says goodbye to all."
2009-11-03T00:00:00Z,"Even before the first pitch of Game 5 on Monday, the Yankees' defining moments of the World Series had already been written. They were not so different from the hallmarks of their last championship. In 2000, the Yankees strangled the Mets from the start, capitalizing on a Game 1 base-running blunder by Timo Perez and using a 10-pitch walk by Paul O'Neill to spark a tying rally in the ninth. In Game 4 against the Phillies on Sunday, Johnny Damon created two similar moments that could also have a lasting place in Yankees lore."

At first, Amazon appeared to be the low-price player when it extended its $9 price tag to three hardcover books that were officially released Nov. 3. Amazon had originally offered that price in response to price-cutting by Wal-Mart on its Web site for preorders of 10 titles that included the three that were released Tuesday: “Ford County” by John Grisham, “The Lacuna” by Barbara Kingsolver and “Kindred in Death” by J. D. Robb. As of Tuesday morning, Amazon still had those titles priced at $9 while Wal-Mart, which had offered them on preorder at $8.98, and Target, which had offered preorders for $8.99, had raised their prices. At Walmart.com, for example, “Ford County” was selling for $12, while “The Lacuna” was $13.50. At Target.com, “The Lacuna” was on sale for $18.89 and “Kindred in Death” was $17. But by late morning, Amazon had raised its prices — “The Lacuna” and “Kindred in Death,” for example, were offered for $13.50 — while Walmart.com had cut them again. All three novels that went on sale Tuesday were on sale at Walmart.com for $8.99, but by the afternoon, Walmart.com had raised its prices to just one penny lower than the price for the three titles on Amazon. In an e-mailed statement, a spokeswoman for Walmart.com said that it would “continue to adjust our pricing accordingly and as needed on these books.”."

He is survived by his son-in-law M.

Born in Santa Barbara, CA, Bill lived in Cambridge, MA, New York City, and Oyster Bay, NY. He attended Belmont Hill School '36 and Harvard College '40, and piloted 25 B-17 bomber missions over Germany, miraculously without a single injury to any of the men in his crews. He was awarded an Air Medal, 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, and a Distinguished Flying Cross. Sure that he'd used up all his luck in that brief period in his life he paid fanatical attention to the inner workings of every car he subsequently owned, including the Bentley he brought home from England after a two-year stint with First National City Bank (later Citibank) in London. He was a member of the Harvard Club of New York, where he played squash and was on the board. Puns, golf, and tennis were his great passions, and he was a fixture on the doubles courts of the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club and the Cove Neck Tennis Club, where he made ample use of his diabolical slice. For the last four-and-a-half years of Missy's life, when her Alzheimer's kicked in, Bill visited her every day, determined that she should not feel abandoned. At the end of their life together, their greatest pleasure was to sit in their wheelchairs holding hands, an example, as one aide observed, ""of what Love looks like."" Memorial Service date TBA.

Stephen Rubin, the new president and publisher of Holt, announced the acquisition on Wednesday, just two days after he started his job. Mr. Rubin was most recently publisher at large at Random House. Ms. Kolbert moves to Holt from Bloomsbury, which published her previous book, “Field Notes From a Catastrophe,” in 2006. Her editor, Gillian Blake, is now at Holt and acquired the new book, “The Sixth Extinction,” an intellectual and natural history of various species. Ms. Blake said she had been talking to Ms. Kolbert about the subject of extinctions for years. “The idea of mass extinctions as the next step after talking about the perils of global warming is the most crucial subject,” Ms. Blake said."
2009-11-05T00:00:00Z,"After dominating record sales for four months, Michael Jackson is finally at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. “Michael Jackson’s This Is It,” above, the companion album to the new movie, sold 373,100 copies in the United States last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Although Jackson has sold more than 5.6 million albums since his death in June, most of those titles have been too old to count on the Billboard 200, the standard album chart. But “This Is It” is a new title, and it becomes Jackson’s sixth No. 1. The film was the top box-office draw last week, taking in $32.5 million in its first five days in the United States. Also on this week’s album chart, Creed’s comeback, “Full Circle” (Wind-Up), opened at No. 2 with 110,000, and Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” (Big Machine), rereleased in a deluxe package, jumped four spots to No. 3 with 109,000. Rod Stewart’s new album, “Soulbook” (J), a collection of covers of classic soul songs, bowed at No. 4 with 84,000 copies sold.

Apple Corps Ltd. and EMI Music said they were releasing a limited-edition USB hard drive that contains the stereo versions of the Beatles’ albums, as well as the bonus materials that were included in their rerelease, including short documentary films about the creation of the studio albums, photos and expanded liner notes. For the tech heads, the companies said that the audio files on the 16-gigabyte drives were in FLAC 44.1 Khz 24 bit and MP3 320 Kbps formats, and compatible with PC and Mac. For people holding credit cards, the drives will be sold at the Beatles’ online store for $279.99 and will be released in North America on Dec. 8. The USB drive’s green apple design, above, is presumably intended to evoke the Apple Corps logo and not the rotten fruit tossed by the villainous Apple Bonkers in “Yellow Submarine.”."
2009-11-05T00:00:00Z,"The current Broadway production of “Hamlet” no longer needs to concern itself with borrowers or lenders — the play has fully recouped its costs, its publicists said on Wednesday. In a news release, press representatives for “Hamlet,” which began previews at the Broadhurst Theater on Sept. 12 and opened on Oct. 6, said that it had earned back its initial Broadway capitalization of $2.5 million as of the week ending Nov. 1. The play, directed by Michael Grandage, is the latest in a series of hits that have moved to Broadway from the Donmar Warehouse in London, which also yielded “Frost/Nixon” and “Mary Stuart.” The success of “Hamlet” might also have something to do with its star, Jude Law, who plays the melancholy Danish prince (above with Geraldine James), and who has held his own in a celebrity-filled season of Broadway neighbors like Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman and Sienna Miller. The limited run of “Hamlet” is to end on Dec. 6."

Sassoon, who dealt with the human toll of war in poems like “They” and “Suicide in the Trenches,” volunteered for military service just before Britain entered World War I, and he was a decorated soldier before he refused to return to duty in 1917. In June several authors, including Sebastian Faulks and Sassoon’s official biographer, Max Egremont, started a campaign to acquire Sassoon’s papers after the death of his son, George, in 2006. With the grant, Cambridge is about $180,000 short of the estate’s asking price of nearly $2 million for the archive."

Sadly, cotton tends to bunch up and sag, which means that panties made from it may require thick elastic. Underwear makers, however, have stepped up to the challenge. There is a growing selection of lingerie meant to combat the dreaded V.P.L. (visible panty line) and designed to be worn with pants by women who are working out, working it or not working at all. Some of the panties have spandex woven into the cotton for greater elasticity and smoothness. Others rely on pima cotton, which is particularly dense and soft, or raw-cut cotton, a patented weave with ends that do not curl or fray. The underwear is often tag-free and seamless, for the smoothest possible surface."

2009-11-06T16:11:16Z,"The college football season has hit a bit of a late mid-season lull, at least on paper. With only two games that are top-25 matchups, this Saturday may seem like a bit of a yawner. But Louisiana State presents a significant challenge for its old coach Nick Saban and his undefeated Alabama team. Will the Crimson Tide be able to get past the Tigers and remain in the middle of the Bowl Championship Series conversation, or will a win by the Tigers brighten the chances of another team, perhaps even an upstart like Cincinnati or Boise State? And then there's Terrelle Pryor's first trip to Penn State with Ohio State. Joe Paterno certainly wanted Pryor to join the Nittany Lions, but he chose the Buckeyes and his career has been a little rocky thus far. Would a marquee road victory help turn things around? Perhaps the most unexpected matchup comes from Tobacco Road, where the fierce basketball rivals, Duke and North Carolina, find themselves in the middle of the A.C.C. race. Might there be a last-second finish, reminiscent of so many men's basketball games between the Blue Devils and the Tar Heels? Our prognosticators have their thoughts but, as always, if you agree, disagree or merely feel their picks out laughable, feel free to chime in."

2009-11-06T14:57:30Z,"In every other sport you have to wait for the playoffs. As the regular season winds down teams with leads rest starters and begin to prepare for the postseason. Not in college football. As the season winds down the pressure on the top teams grows. The better you've been through the course of the season the more pressure is on you. You need to perform week in and week out. No resting anyone. In college football, the regular season is the playoffs. Think about this weekend's Alabama/L.S.U. game. A 3:30 p.m. game on a November Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium with the SEC West on the line definitely has a playoff feel about it. Ohio State/Penn State at Beaver Stadium is basically an elimination game in the Big Ten. At this point in the season, every week is a playoff game for teams like Iowa, Texas, Florida, Boise State, T.C.U. and Cincinnati. The more teams that are undefeated the more important it gets not to lose. No one can afford a let down. The weather is colder, the stakes are higher and total chaos always seems right around the corner. Gotta love the college football."

But as The Guardian reports, the ranking has drawn protests from a women’s literary group that notes there are no female writers on the list. Cate Marvin, a founder of the group Women in Letters and Literary Arts, told The Guardian, “The absence made me nearly speechless.” In her introduction to the year-end list Louisa Ermelino, the reviews director of Publishers Weekly, wrote, “We ignored gender and genre and who had the buzz.” She added, “It disturbed us when we were done that our list was all male.”."

I sort of collapsed in the dressing room, and a medical team from the hall was sent in. Five minutes later I was in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.” The Detroit Symphony told The Free Press that Mr. Slatkin was still scheduled to conduct the orchestra in Detroit this month, but that contingency plans were being made."
2009-11-06T00:00:00Z,"The producers of the multimillion-dollar Broadway musical “Spider-man, Turn Off the Dark” have scheduled a meeting in Manhattan on Friday with the director Julie Taymor and other members of the creative team to discuss the show’s future, two executives involved in the project said Thursday. They said that the producers would update the creative team on the project’s cash-flow problems, and that Ms. Taymor would say that it would be difficult to begin rehearsals before January. Even if the musical’s financial difficulties are solved in time for rehearsals to begin this winter, the show is so technically complex — Spider-man’s acrobatics and possible mid-air flight for instance — that Ms. Taymor and the producers may not be prepared to open the show by April 29, the cutoff date for Tony Award nominations, said the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly about the production. If the show is not ready to be considered for the Tonys this season, the reasoning goes, the production team and cast would be better off waiting to open later — assuming the producers aren’t faced with a huge financial penalty for delaying use of the Hilton Theater, which they have already ripped up to accommodate Ms. Taymor’s vision for the musical. The show is still scheduled to begin previews on Feb. 25 and open in March, but several people involved in the production said those dates would change."

Mr. Ralston made headlines in 2003 when an 800-pound boulder fell on his right hand and crushed it while he was exploring Robbers Roost in southeastern Utah. After being trapped for several days, he sawed off the lower part of the trapped arm and hiked to his rescue. The project is expected to reunite Mr. Boyle with two “Slumdog Millionaire” colleagues: the screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and the producer Christian Colson. Production is to begin next year; no casting has yet been announced."

2009-11-06T00:00:00Z,"Courtney Love threatened to do it, but Gwen Stefani actually did it: Ms. Stefani and her band, No Doubt, have sued the makers of the Guitar Hero video game franchise, saying that their latest entry in the series misuses the likenesses of the group members, Reuters reported. In its lawsuit against the game publisher Activision Blizzard, No Doubt said it had agreed on Ms. Stefani and her band mates appearing in the new game Band Hero. But the rock group said that the game makers went too far by allowing Ms. Stefani’s virtual counterpart to perform songs that No Doubt never recorded, including “Honky Tonk Women” by the Rolling Stones. This “results in an unauthorized performance by the Gwen Stefani avatar in a male voice boasting about having sex with prostitutes,” the lawsuit says. In a statement Activision Blizzard said it “believes it is within its legal rights with respect to the use and portrayal of the band members in the game.” Ms. Love, the widow of the Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, raised similar objections when she learned that a Cobain avatar could be used to perform other artists’ songs in the video game Guitar Hero 5."

2009-11-07T00:00:00Z,"Fans of ''South Park'' are well aware that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of that Comedy Central animated series, are not exactly delicate about the language on the show. An episode broadcast on Wednesday elicited a call from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation that Comedy Central and the ''South Park'' staff apologize for what the alliance called a ''slur-filled episode.'' On the episode, called ''The F-Word,'' the children of ''South Park,'' above, frequently say the word ''fag'' as they try to change the meaning of the word to a slur against inconsiderate motorcyclists instead of against gay people. In a news release officials of the advocacy group said that they recognized that the episode was trying to ''use edgy humor to provide commentary on current issues.'' They added: ''Yet despite what the 'South Park' writers may believe, the definition of the F-word remains one that is harmful and derogatory.'' In a statement, Comedy Central said that the episode ''has been both criticized and applauded within the gay and lesbian community.''''With all of that in mind,'' it continued, we will let this 'South Park' episode speak for itself.''"

Survived by eight of her original 12 brothers and sisters, many nieces and nephews and by many others who loved her. A native of County Roscommon in Ireland, Patricia was a professional nanny and nurse who moved to America in March 1955. A big and handsome woman, she was loving, kind, wise, and fiercely principled and independent. She made a huge positive impact on the children whom she raised over a period of 50 years: Louis Gershon of North London; the children of the late Norman and Alice Newhouse when they lived in Great Neck, L.I., Robin, Mark, Peter, Jonathan and David Newhouse; Giles and Julian Eyre, and their two brothers, of New York City, and lastly, Charlie Stone, now living in North Carolina. It was Charlie who last year reached out to her former charges and reconnected them to Patricia after so many years without contact. She loved to travel in her free time and had many friends, especially in Ireland. She loved the cliffs of Donegal. Her intellectual interests ranged from architecture to the Russian language. But her great gift was the love she brought into the lives of the children she raised. For this one, it is a light which will never be extinguished. Jonathan Newhouse, London"

The bust of Nefertiti, the wife of the pharaoh Akhenaten, is on display at the Neues Museum in Berlin; it was discovered in 1912 by the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt, who said he had Egyptian approval to take it. But Egypt has been calling for its return since 1930, and Mr. Hawass said that at the December meeting he would present evidence that ''proves the statue left in an illegal way,'' according to Agence France-Presse. Mr. Hawass also said that the Berlin museum official would make the case ''that the statue left Egypt through legal channels.''"

Nixon (Frank Langella, above left), three years after Nixon left the presidency in disgrace. Mr. Frost was gambling with his money and future; Nixon, with public perception (though he earned $600,000 and 10 percent of the program's profits). The result was blockbuster ratings to rival those of ''Happy Days,'' starring Ron Howard, who directed this adaptation of Peter Morgan's play. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis described the film as ''a soothing, agreeably amusing experience, more palliative than purgative,'' adding that Mr. Langella and Mr. Sheen, who originated their roles on the London stage and later repeated them on Broadway, were ''first-rate.'' 10:30 A.M.

And the third reason for drawing attention to the story in the weekend edition of the International Herald Tribune was for the WONDERFULLY odd and serendipitous event that meant that while my season review story mentions the Max Mosley sex scandal of last year and his subsequent battle with a British newspaper - the whole idea there were Nazi role playing connotations etc. - well, on page two of the print version of the same paper in which my story appeared was also a little piece from the same newspaper 75 years ago, in which a certain Oswald Mosley, Max's father, won a case against another British newspaper in a libel case, in the second item of the story. Wonderful how these things happen sometimes. Not so often seen in the new media, I think."

But what will please the little ones is that unlike that era's blocks, which mostly encouraged the dutiful construction of towns and landscapes, the strange contours of the 74 PlayShapes will let them build whatever animal, vegetable or psychedelic '60s pop star they please. ''We spent ages looking at old toys and seeing what had been done before, how we could make it new,'' says PlayShapes' Brighton, U.K.-based co-creator Zoe Miller, who with her partner David Goodman also designs vintage-inspired kids' toys and books for the Tate.

But the result was weak for a movie that cost about $175 million to make (not including marketing costs), starred Jim Carrey in a cluster of roles, and was given one of the biggest releases yet on higher-priced 3-D screens. Did families decide it looked too dark? Did the motion-capture filmmaking style lessen interest? Or did a lot of moviegoers figure they would catch the holiday movie in the weeks ahead? Disney, which noted that the film, directed by Robert Zemeckis, made an additional $12 million in 18 foreign markets, hopes the latter."

''Look at the sky, Papa,'' Levi exclaimed. ''It's beautiful.'' The first piece Gray ever built was a three-legged chair. His teacher told him it would never stand up. ''But I made it anyway,'' he said. ''And it worked!'' (Gray is seated in a Victor armchair by Paul Loebach.) His company's Web address, MatterMatters.com, speaks to the challenge of creating objects in a world that's already glutted with them. ''That's the daily quandary: Do you create more?'' he asks. ''But, ultimately, if there's a want, somebody has to take responsibility for it. My intention is to create heirloom pieces that won't end up at the bottom of a landfill.'"

So the Imagination Playground at Burling Slip, which opens next summer in a former parking lot near South Street Seaport, is a logical next step. The peanut-shaped park is inspired by midcentury adventure playgrounds, where children used found objects and postwar debris. It features sand and water, Playground Associates to oversee the action, and more than 350 loose parts, including wheelbarrows, pool noodles and weather- and germ-resistant foam blocks (above, in Brooklyn). David Rockwell, the founder and C.E.O., has created a standard kit that can be deployed cheaply in open spaces across the country, but at Burling Slip he pays homage to its nautical past with pulleys, masts and periscope-like tubes through which children can talk from opposite ends of the park. “Each place encourages a kind of cooperative, self-directed fantasy play,” he says. “Or you can just run around like a maniac.” [?][?][?] JILL SINGER."

With the help of nine volunteer-driven cells from Austin, Tex., to Johannesburg, Pilloton, who started the company with a laptop and $1,000 while living at home with her parents, aims to create local design solutions and apply them globally. (The playgrounds, for example, were conceived in Uganda and have since been installed in North Carolina and the Dominican Republic.) Pilloton is also the author of the just-released book “Design Revolution: 100 Products That Empower People” (Metropolis Books), which gives well-deserved shout-outs to everything from the Hippo Water Roller (a portable vessel that can carry a week’s worth of water for a family of seven) and Braille-based Lego-style building blocks to D.I.Y. soccer balls (left) and SkySails (which are large enough to help propel cargo ships). “If it’s any consolation,” she insists, “I’ve aged a lot over the last year.” [?][?][?] ALIX BROWNE."

Gray, who owns the less-is-more New York design shop Matter, recalls once waking up at 5:30 a.m. to find the 3-year-old Levi gazing through the window of their Brooklyn apartment. “Look at the sky, Papa,” Levi exclaimed. “It’s beautiful.” The first piece Gray ever built was a three-legged chair. His teacher told him it would never stand up. “But I made it anyway,” he said. “And it worked!” (Gray is seated above in a Victor armchair by Paul Loebach.) His company’s Web address, MatterMatters.com, speaks to the challenge of creating objects in a world that’s already glutted with them. “That’s the daily quandary: Do you create more?” he asks. “But, ultimately, if there’s a want, somebody has to take responsibility for it. My intention is to create heirloom pieces that won’t end up at the bottom of a landfill.’ [?][?][?] STEPHEN HEYMAN."
2009-11-08T00:00:00Z,"Warren Buffett is now a cartoon character. The Oracle of Omaha has a starring role in “Secret Millionaire’s Club,” a Web series produced by AOL and A Squared Entertainment that goes live in January. This is not a move to stanch his declining fortunes — the man’s still worth $40 billion, after all — but a pro bono effort to teach kids fiscal responsibility. (Adults, Buffett must think, are now beyond his help.) The “club” is made up of a group of young Nebraskans who sell baseball memorabilia online and use the profits to bankroll an investment business; an animated (and slenderized) Buffett serves as their adviser. Searching for a youth-friendly analogue, Andy Heyward, the show’s producer, says, “It’s a little bit like Monopoly.” Heyward first collaborated with Buffett on the animated introductions to Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, in which the frugal tycoon has spoofed Batman and James Bond. “Warren is amazing,” Heyward says. “He does everything in just one take.” [?][?][?] STEPHEN HEYMAN."

On Nov. 26, the Serpentine Gallery opens its first-ever contemporary design exhibition, “Design Real,” curated by the German industrial designer Konstantin Grcic.

She and her partner Claus Hojer Hansen have come up with an antidote: a 1/16-size reproduction of Arne Jacobsen’s own 1929 house, approved by Jacobsen’s family and scheduled for release early next year. There are Egg and Swan chairs courtesy of Fritz Hansen, tiny Vipp trash cans and a working lamp by the Danish studio Design by Us. New pieces commissioned just for the house so far include a childlike scribble by the artist Poul Pava and prospective inhabitants by the dollmaker Maileg. Stenberg has already noticed a change in her kids since she let them play with the prototypes: “They recognize the furniture now,” she says. “When they see a Jacobsen, they say, ‘Oh, Mommy, those are your chairs, only bigger.’ ” [?][?][?] MONICA KHEMSUROV."

But it was a residential project — his radical revision of his own little Dutch colonial in Santa Monica, Calif. — that put him on the map in the late 1970s and allowed him to explore the ideas that came to define his architecture. This house and others are included in “Frank Gehry: The Houses” (Rizzoli), by Mildred Friedman, who in 1986, as the design curator at the Walker Art Center, mounted the first major museum exhibition of the architect’s work. (I contributed an essay to its catalog.) The book, which has an intimate, down-to-earth tone, features not only abundant visual material but also interviews with Gehry, his clients (including his wife, Berta), and current and former members of his firm. And seeing projects like his own home, the never-built extravaganza that he designed for the insurance magnate Peter Lewis or the guesthouse (right) that he completed in 1987 for Mike and Penny Winton in Wayzata, Minn., makes you hope Gehry still has another house (or two) in him.

2009-11-08T00:00:00Z,"I MET Angelika Wachs for only a few minutes of my life. But what moments they were -- our share of history in its most momentous shift since 1945. It was the evening of Nov. 9, 1989. I had arrived in Berlin the night before, convinced revolution was under way in East Germany, and had spent the day reporting in an East Berlin suburb. The mood there was grim -- all the suspicion, cynicism and stale shoddiness bred by 40 years of totalitarian rule on full display. Despite the exodus of 50,000 East Germans to West Germany via Czechoslovakia in the five days before that gray, freezing Thursday, despite the resignation of the East German Communist Party Politburo and growing street protests, hope was as scarce as coveted luxuries like bananas."

This popular style allows the wearer to put together her own layered look, and it was seen -- in fake fur, real fur and knits -- on the backs of many women watching the thousands of runners in the New York City Marathon last Sunday. That day there was also an unofficial marathon for the hundreds of pedicabs gathered around Columbus Circle to take exhausted runners back to their hotels. Their passengers disgorged, they sped back in order to pick up more footsore passengers on this one-day business bonanza."

2009-11-08T00:00:00Z,"In one of its core civic myths, New York prides itself as a street-smart city inured to blarney -- if only because of the sheer amount of it thrown around in millions of human interactions each day. So give Mayor Michael Bloomberg credit. His successful bid for a third term was a masterpiece of illusion. Using $90 million from his own fortune, he persuaded a good many people that it would be a sucker's bet to back his opponent, the Democrat William C. Thompson Jr. The close results left his opponents in a graveyard of what-ifs. State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman offered up this epitaph: ''Bill Thompson was always closer than people thought, and on our side, if people had been behind him more, there would have been more checks, more endorsements, more attention, and that might have made the difference.''"
2009-11-08T00:00:00Z,"With three rounds of playoffs, one of them a best-of-five series, the modern postseason is designed to ensure that the best team in baseball wins the World Series only a small percentage of the time. This randomness inherent in the playoffs is the game's built-in remedy for its competitive-balance woes, and has felled four Yankees squads this decade that posted the game's best record but fell short of a title. The 87-victory championship team in 2000 reinforced the notion that the postseason is a crapshoot, but the 2009 edition offered a different lesson. Sometimes, being really, really good is indeed good enough to win it all."

If you know your way around on two wheels back home, once you get going, you'll find there is an elaborate code of order on the roads. ''We get lots of Americans,'' said Bruno Zarlenga, the owner of Barberini Scooters for Rent (Via della Purificazione 84; 39-06-48-85-485; www.rentscooter.it), which opened in 1979. ''They are usually very enthusiastic when they get back.'' Maps are provided, guided tours can be booked in advance, and for 40 euros (about $60 at $1.53 to the euro), a small motor scooter is yours for the day. A few pointers. In Rome the scooter takes precedence over the car. A little toot of the horn means ''hi'' or ''thanks''; longer ones mean you aren't happy. Lanes? If you're driving a scooter, any space in the road is a lane -- use this to your advantage. It's expected. JESSICA DONATI"

It was Charlie who last year reached out to her former charges and reconnected them to Patricia after so many years without contact. She loved to travel in her free time and had many friends, especially in Ireland. She loved the cliffs of Donegal. Her intellectual interests ranged from architecture to the Russian language. But her great gift was the love she brought into the lives of the children she raised. For this one, it is a light which will never be extinguished. Jonathan Newhouse, London"

With 10 times the toxins needed to kill an adult, its bite is called the kiss of death. This ''Nature'' episode journeys to Swaziland in southern Africa, where the black mamba can be found lurking in sugar cane plantations as well as in homes, gardens, schools and even hotel rooms -- and where the traditional response has been to kill the snakes before being killed by them. But recently, snake handlers like Thea and Clifton Litschka-Koen have been working to change public perception of what they believe is the world's most misunderstood creature. (Above, one of their employees handles a specimen.) And in doing so, they have inspired King Mswati III of Swaziland to donate land for a nature reserve on which relocated black mambas can live, and to build a clinic specializing in the treatment of snakebites, the first of its kind in the country. 10 A.M.

It seemed only a few minutes had passed before Philip Naudé, one of the producers, gave the directors their assignments. Leigh Kilton-Smith is to direct Stephen Belber's play, ""Ramen Noodle,"" and her reaction seemed unclear for a moment - was that pleasant shock or something more like horror that flashed across her face?"

2009-11-09T11:19:30Z,"Updated | 1:20 p.m. A long-running theatrical marriage has hit a major bump: a union that represents professional musicians has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, saying that the producers of the show ""Tony N' Tina's Wedding"" fired its contracted musicians and replaced them with recorded music. The Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said that in 2008 it renewed a three-year agreement with the previous producers of that show, which covered its performers through May 2011, and stipulated that it must be honored if new producers came onto the show. The union said that the producers Kim and Sonny Ricciardi of Broadway Entertainment, which recently took over ""Tony N' Tina's Wedding,"" paid the musicians for the show's Oct. 10 performance and asked them to learn a new song for Oct. 17. On that date, however, the union said the producers locked the musicians out of the performance space and have denied them access to their instruments and other property. A representative for Local 802 said a meeting had been scheduled for Monday afternoon to address the dispute. A message left at Broadway Entertainment was not immediately returned."

2009-11-09T10:57:31Z,"Street art in Auckland, New Zealand, is much more than just random acts of spray paint. Nearly every corner of the city is decorated with sophisticated graphic imagery, from stencil drawings (sharks, angels, aerosol-can characters) to murals (intergalactic space settings, muscle men portraiture) to ""throw-ups"" (elaborate, bubble-shaped letters forming the artist's signature). The city council has even allowed electrical boxes to be used as 3-D canvases for street art. While some of the artists and collectives have achieved a certain visibility in the graffiti world - a local crew called TMD (The Most Def) has won the ""Write For Gold"" international competition in Germany for the past two years - many of the taggers are anonymous. And if you want to see their handiwork, you'd better be quick. Most of the art (excluding the electrical-box mainstays) is either torn down or painted over within a few days. As Andrew Beck, from the Auckland collective Surplus Bargains, says: ""That's what street art is - temporary."""

There is already a set on the stage, a big, English country house designed by Allen Moyer for ""After Miss Julie,"" and the writers will have to work with it or around it. This is not a simple matter, given the absurdly long wooden table, the abundance of what looks like delicate china and a number of other items that are not likely to fit every play that is being cooked up.

2009-11-10T16:13:28Z,"The new issue of the Web journal Open Letters Monthly features a ""cover"" portrait of Marguerite Duras by the Swedish artist Carl Köhler, who died in 2006. It's a pretty cool image - a sketchy double exposure showing Duras both as an old woman and in the prime of her life, with blocks of color that make it appear as if she's emerging ghostlike from the gloom - but the main thing that caught my attention was the painter's name. I've been looking at a lot of Carl Köhler's author portraits lately. Earlier this year, the Brooklyn Central Library mounted an exhibition of them, which I missed, but after the show left Brooklyn for Washington, I heard from its curator (and the artist's son), Henry Köhler, who forwarded a batch of his father's work. Köhler was a neo-modernist who especially liked to paint writers and intellectuals: Kafka, Beckett, Joyce, Gide, Beauvoir, all in a rough, haunting style that captured their writerly moods as much as their physical appearances. The exhibition will travel early next year to Toronto and Vancouver, but you can peek at some of Köhler's paintings in a slide show, here."

Redefining the concept of over-booking, it is serving up more than any one person can see. The events I've managed to attend have ranged from great to less than, and run the gamut in terms of production values. It was production values to fore on Saturday in Tacita Dean's sleek, gorgeously majestic ""Craneway Event,"" a 16mm color film that was unexpectedly hypnotic at St. Marks on the Bowery. Her second collaboration with the choreographer Merce Cunningham is a slow-moving documentary (100 minutes) of a rehearsal in the cavernous, many-windowed craneway of a refurbished factory in northern California. Ms. Dean's themes center on the ineluctable movement of light -- and to some extent the camera -- through time and space. A great artist still at work at the end of his career, surrounded by acolytes and ever-deepening shadows, is the perfect subject for her relentless, elegiac art."

We've been hearing whispers about the London band the XX since late summer, when they released their superb debut album, ""XX,"" in Europe - and a whisper is the appropriate register for this music, with its wispy vocals and sparse arrangements that echo a range of styles from old-school soul to modern-day trip-hop. The record's October release stateside brought more praise (including this from The New York Times); and a month-long United States tour, kicking off tomorrow in New York, may be just what the band needs to bring the whispers to a roar.The four-piece band already seems wise beyond its years (each member is barely 20 years old), and for the video for their first single, ""Basic Space"" (above), they made a clever choice in hiring Anthony Dickenson, an up-and-coming British director and photographer. Dickenson recently picked up a UK Music Video Award for this music video from Speech Debelle and is currently at work on a photo project that will be exhibited next year. The ""Basic Space"" video warrants watching in high definition - it's a cool experiment with light, speed and focus that fits perfectly with the XX's minimalist aesthetic."

2009-11-10T00:00:00Z,"KANE--Janet. (May 2, 1926 - November 7, 2009) died peacefully Saturday morning with her husband of sixty-one years, Stanley, and one of her three daughters by her side. She lived for eighty-three pleasure-filled years, eighty-one of which were enjoyed in perfect health, without even a minor surgery. The day before her passing, she worked on her beautiful orchids, which always filled her home, blooming year after year under her loving care. In the evening she enjoyed a dinner of grey sole, zucchini seasoned with cinnamon, and oven-roasted potatoes, all the while commenting on how delicious everything was. Janet was a devoted wife. Try as her daughters did to whisk her away on any number of girls' weekends, Janet would always reply, ""Oh, I couldn't possibly leave your father."" Janet first met Stanley when they were youngsters in New Rochelle, NY, but it was after Stanley returned home from the war that she stole his heart. They married and raised three daughters The Kane Girls in New Rochelle and then Bedford Hills, NY. Since then and forever after Janet would tout that her daughters were her greatest achievement. Janet and Stanley moved to Sarasota in 1984 where they quickly became pillars of Sarasota society. Equally known for their great parties and philanthropy, Janet was both the Belle of the Ball and YMCA First Citizen. She had an unrivaled zest for life. Wherever she went, people loved being near her. Her enthusiasm was infectious, her generosity enormous. She was brilliant, and could talk about everything from politics to literature, fashion to food. Always witty and insightful, she lit up every room with her glowing warmth and spirit. So much so that people often called her before scheduling their parties, so as to make sure that she'd be there. She was a thoroughly glamorous party girl who created fun everywhere she went. Delighted by the dresses, piqued by the gossip, and thrilled by everyone's plans, your joy was her joy, your sorrow her tears. She had the rare gift of making you feel entirely special, as though you were the most important person in the world. In her eyes you were beautiful, brilliant, and talented. She was everyone's greatest fan, which in turn made her everyone's favorite friend. Janet is survived by her husband, Stanley, her daughters, Katherine Kane, Betsy Kane-Hartnett, and Priscilla Kane Hellweg, her sons-in law, Olin West, John Kane-Hartnett, and John Hellweg, her seven grandchildren, Meghan Kane-Hartnett, Jesse Kane-Hartnett, Liza Kane-Hartnett, Jonah Kane-West, Daniel Kane-West, Jasper Kane Hellweg, and Brendan Ellis Hellweg, her twin brother, George Haas, four pugs, and one ringed-necked parrot. Lively, brilliant, generous, irreverent, a pistol, a firecracker, a Scrabble player and a flirt, Janet Kane was above all else, a cherished wife, an adored mother, a prized grandmother, and a friend to all. She was the heart and soul of Sarasota and will be sorely missed.

2009-11-10T00:00:00Z,"ST. JOHN--Judson, of Naples, FL died on November 4, 2009. Born in Fort Wayne, IN on August 26, 1926 to Lillian Hazel (nee Judson) and Harold St. John. Judson married Grace Burke Doremus on August 6, 1951. They shared a wonderful and full life together until Grace's death in January 2006. They lived in Grosse Pointe, MI, Chappaqua, NY and Villanova, PA. They moved to Naples in 1989 when Jud retired from American Home Products (now Wyeth soon to be part of Pfizer). Jud's entire professional career of 38 years was spent at American Home Products (AHP) where he ultimately rose to the President of Ayerst Laboratories, and later Wyeth-Ayerst. His career path at Ayerst included: Sales Representative from 1951-1955; District Manager from 1956-1962; Assistant Sales Manager from 1963-1970; Vice President of Operations from 1971-1976; Executive Vice President from 1977-1982; and President from 1983-1986. AHP later combined its two pharmaceutical divisions to form Wyeth-Ayerst in 1987. Jud was named President of the merged organization and held this role until his retirement in 1989. After graduating from Pontiac High School, Jud enlisted in the United States Navy and served from 1944 to 1946. Early duty took him from a medical clinic in northern Idaho to a troop transport ship in the South Pacific. His sense of naval service permeated his life and was manifest in his personal collection of nautical art. After his discharge from the Navy in 1946, he attended Kenyon College for two years as a Pre-Med student and later received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1950. He was a competitive diver on the Kenyon swimming team and a proud member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. Jud's love of the outdoors was reflected in his hobbies swimming, hunting, fishing and golf. A passionate naturalist, he was a member of the Purple Martin Society and a lover of animals dogs in particular. He shared his 83 years with over six dogs. His fondness for swimming and diving, along with his early experience as a lifeguard at Pine Lake Country Club in Pontiac, certainly influenced his decision to enlist in the U.S. Navy. Later in life, his passion turned to golf and his memberships included Whippoorwill Country Club, Merion Golf Club and Eagle Creek Country Club (where he was a Founding Member and former President). He was also a member of the Oscoda Yacht Club and the Naples Yacht Club. Judson is survived by his son, Burke and daughter-in-law, Lisa St. John of Chappaqua, NY; grandchildren Jennifer, Luke, Burke, Jr. and Dylan; and brothers, Harold St. John and Richard St. John. A private memorial will be held in late November. Memorials may be made to the American Brain Tumor Association, 2720 River Road, Des Plaines, IL 60018 (www.abta.org) in the name of Judson St. John.

Nidal Malik Hasan, who is accused of shooting to death 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., and a radical cleric in Yemen known for his incendiary anti-American teachings. But federal authorities dropped an inquiry into the matter after deciding the messages warranted no further action, government officials said on Monday. Maj. Hasan's exchanges with Anwar al-Awlaki, once a spiritual leader at a mosque in suburban Virginia where Maj. Hasan worshipped, indicate that the troubled military psychiatrist came to the attention of the authorities long before long before last Thursday's shooting rampage at Fort Hood, but left him in his post.

We think the show still has life in it.” “The 39 Steps” has been playing lately to houses that are only about two-thirds full, but the lower running costs off Broadway could yield lower-priced tickets — and potentially more customers. ...

2009-11-11T00:00:00Z,"A taste of turkey to start Thanksgiving is not overkill. The smoked turkey I used to prepare this classic spread tastes more of ham than bird. I simmered the meat and skin stripped from a drumstick in broth and poultry fat until the broth evaporated, then shredded the meat with the fat in a food processor. It was just like making duck or pork rillettes, except that the meat was already cooked. Smoked turkey is sold by some meat purveyors. But a plain roasted drumstick, bought prepared or leftover, will also do the trick."

Unless we are adding energy artificially (robotics, engines, etc.), these prostheses replace what isn't there. There are ways to test whether they enable competitors to run or to run better than they otherwise might (the unilateral test subjects were chosen precisely because their one natural leg provided a control). When I was a kid, anyone who owned a Guinness Book of World Records will remember the arresting photo of the football player who lacked part of a foot and, with a shoe shaped like a brick, kicked the longest field goal in pro football history.

The rules he has imposed and strictly enforced in his league -- penalizing all hits to the head, enforcing stern and consistent suspensions for flagrant violations of all safety-related rules -- created a climate that changed the conversation in Canada, opening the way for traditional fans to begin thinking about a game that tries to reduce catastrophic injuries and promote mutual respect among players on the ice.

2009-11-13T00:00:00Z,"COTTON--Eugene, one of the leading labor lawyers of his generation and a tireless advocate for working Americans, passed away Wednesday, November 11, in New York City. He was 95. A native New Yorker, Cotton was educated in NYC public schools, attended CCNY and Columbia Law School before spending most of his professional life in Chicago. He achieved national prominence in the labor bar while serving as General Counsel of the United Packinghouse Workers of America from 1948 to 1968. He represented the union in many precedent-setting labor agreements and bitter strikes that received national attention. Cotton moved back to New York City in 2003. Cotton graduated magna cum laude at age 19 from the College of the City of New York (voted by his classmates as ""most brilliant"" in the class), and received his law degree in 1936 from Columbia, where he served on the Columbia Law Review. After a year at a New York law firm, Cotton's interest in the progressive politics of the New Deal, and in the labor movement in particular, led him to work at the NY State Labor Relations Board. In 1941, he headed to Washington, DC as Special Counsel at the Federal Communications Commission to lead hearings on the Commission's policies on newspaper ownership of radio stations. Drafted into the Navy in 1943, he was headed for the Pacific theatre when the war ended. Cotton then returned to his ""first love,"" the labor movement, holding a dual appointment as the Assistant General Counsel of the CIO and of United Steelworkers of America. In 1948, Cotton moved his family to Chicago, to become the General Counsel of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA), a position he held for more than twenty years Following that union's merger with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen (AMCBW), he served as General Counsel of the Packinghouse Department of the AMCBW until it, in turn, merged into the United Food and Commercial Workers. Cotton also represented the Amalgamated Lithographers of America, a relationship that flourished through a series of mergers that eventually brought the separate unions of lithographers, photoengravers, bookbinders and printing pressmen into a single union. He also served as General Counsel of the Inter-Local Pension Fund, which evolved from five participating union locals to more than 50 participating locals backed by assets of approximately $1.75 billion. During his 20 years with the UPWA, Cotton negotiated contracts with the major meat packing companies that set the pattern - and the standard - for that industry, including some of the first negotiated pension and medical benefit plans in the Nation. Throughout his career, Cotton was at the forefront of many of the major advances in employer-union relations during the post-War period, many of which represented ground-breaking settlements on wages, safer working conditions, and precedent-setting medical and pension benefits for workers in the packing and graphics industries. Beginning in 1951, and throughout his career in Chicago, he also served as a senior partner in the Chicago law firm, Cotton, Watt, Jones & King for 43 years. He was an active participant in Chicago's civic and political life, including serving as President of the Chicago City Club from 1966-68. Near the end of his legal career, he was outspoken in expressing regret at what he called the ""weakening of legal protections of collective bargaining rights"" and the reversal in the meatpacking industry of many of the advances that he had fought so hard to achieve over the prior 30 years. In an interview he gave in 2001, long after he had retired, he expressed the hope that ""my younger and more vigorous colleagues in the labor union bar will continue to contribute to the effective performance of labor's vital role in society."" A memorial service will be held on November 29 to treasure memories of Gene's dry sense of humor, razor-sharp wit, commitment to progressive politics and the labor movement, and devotion to friends and family. Cotton's wife of 68 years, Sylvia, pre-deceased him one year ago. He is survived by his two sons, Richard Cotton of New York City, and Stephen Cotton of Andover, Massachusetts; daughter-in-law Rebecca Backman; former daughter-in-law Jamie Fellner; niece Judy Quittman; nephews Stuart Cotton, Richard and Robert Glickstein, and Daniel Steinbrocker; and two grandchildren, Rachel Cotton and Jon Cotton."

He graduated from The Loyola School in New York, Georgetown University and the Columbia University School of Law. He served briefly in the military police in WWII. He began his career ad an associate at the law firm of Winthrop, Stimpson, Putnam and Roberts. He moved to the legal department of Bristol-Myers where, after a distinguished career, he retired in 1992 as General Counsel and Senior Vice-President for Corporate Affairs. He served as the Chairman of the Mercantile Library of New York and on the Board of the Visiting Nurse Services of New York.

2009-11-13T00:00:00Z,"KOZAK--Lillian, passed away peacefully in her home on November 11, 2009. An ardent leader in the fight for women's rights, as well as a professional accountant and auditor in the Nassau County Attorney's Office, Family Court Bureau from 1977-2002, Lillian was appointed Chair of The National Organization for Women-New York State Domestic Relations Task Force in 1975. Professional surveys show that the number one reason women contact NOW is for issues related to divorce. Lillian and the core of women she attracted to work with the NOW Task Force were fierce in their determination to end the impoverishment of women and their families once they went through the legal process of divorce. Her background as an accountant gave her the professional skills to monitor such technical issues as laws covering joint bank accounts, the hidden drawbacks in equitable division of property and poorly drafted divorce mediation agreements. Early on, she warned that alternate dispute resolution programs could put women at a disadvantage economically or in cases of child custody and support. Lillian advocated not only for making domestic violence an element in any court evaluation about the ""best interests of the child"" but also for ending practices that resulted in fraudulent statements about assets. Lillian was a recipient of the Susan B. Anthony award of The National Organization for Women-New York State, The National NOW Woman to Woman Award, the Long Island NOW Lifetime Achievement Award, and recently, The Award for Lifetime Service from the Coalition for Family Justice. She is survived by her daughter Ellen Kozak and her son-in-law, Scott Miller of New York City. Her son Jeffrey Kozak is deceased. A memorial service will be announced."

That's the atmosphere at the start of ''Matthew Takes Mannahatta,'' a refreshingly clever musical for audiences 5 to 12 from Vital Family Theater. The title character and his sister, Piper, live in a state of perpetual squabbling; caged wolverines would be friendlier. Aurin Squire, who wrote the show's book, captures the hell that is a holiday car trip (best lines: ''I can hear Piper breathing. Tell her to stop.''), and Sammy Buck, the lyricist, has humorously rewritten ''Over the River and Through the Woods.'' Here Grandmother's house is a Manhattan apartment, and ''Under the Hudson and Through the Tunnel'' includes a refrain about circling for a parking space. The rest of the music, by Daniel S. Acquisto, is upbeat pop, except for a gentle flute that represents Grandma's antique whistle."

2009-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Thieves in Norway stole a rare lithograph by Edvard Munch on Thursday, Agence France-Presse reported. A police spokesman said on Friday that the robbers broke an art gallery window, grabbed the work, called “History,” right, and escaped. Though several lithographs of the work exist, the one that was stolen had been hand-colored by Munch himself. It sold at an auction in 2001 for about $35,000, but Agence France-Presse reported the current value at more than 10 times that amount, about $355,000. Munch artwork has been targeted by thieves before: in 2004 two armed masked men burst into the Munch museum in Oslo in daylight and stole “The Scream” and “Madonna” paintings before escaping in a getaway car driven by a third man. Ten years earlier another version of “The Scream” was stolen from Oslo’s national gallery on the opening day of the Lillehammer Winter Olympics. The works were recovered in both cases."
2009-11-14T00:00:00Z,"After years of battles over the Barnes Foundation’s plan to bypass its charter and bylaws and move its art collection from suburban Merion, Pa., to downtown Philadelphia, the foundation broke ground on Friday for its new home, designed by the architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. A 2004 court ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to go against the wishes of Albert C. Barnes, who built the collection and stipulated that no picture in it could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans’ Court said in the ruling that he considered the move “the only viable alternative” to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But opponents — a couple dozen of whom protested on Friday morning outside the groundbreaking ceremony, above, waving signs with messages including: “Crime Scene. Do Not Enter. Destruction of National Historic Landmark in Progress” — contend that the collection’s financial troubles are surmountable and that the move is motivated primarily by the Philadelphia political establishment’s desire to generate more downtown tourism. “This is not about art — it’s about politics,” said Evelyn Yaari, a member of Friends of the Barnes Foundation, which organized the protest."

2009-11-14T00:00:00Z,"It was an up-and-down week of news for the video gaming business. On the upside, the debut of the highly anticipated shooting game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 set a sales record for the industry, Variety reported: the game, which retails for $59.99, sold 4.7 million units in its first day on sale in the United States and Britain, taking in $310 million for the game publisher Activision Blizzard. (By comparison, the year’s highest-grossing movie, “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” had earned more than $200 million domestically by the end of its first weekend.) On the downside, the industry saw its overall sales decline during October, compared with the same month last year, according to a report from NPD Group. Sales of hardware, software and accessories totaled $1.07 billion for October 2009, down 19 percent from the $1.32 billion in sales in October 2008. NPD predicted that the industry’s revenues for the year would be from $20 billion to $21 billion, most likely down from last year’s tally of $21.3 billion, though coming releases like New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Assassin’s Creed 2 could still turn things around."

Johnson, the blues guitarist of “Sweet Home Chicago” and “Love in Vain” who influenced artists from Muddy Waters to Eric Clapton, was born in 1911 in Hazlehurst, Miss., in a home built by his stepfather. The birthplace was verified in a letter from his half-sister, according to the cultural affairs office of Copiah County, which is seeking to raise $250,000 to restore the home as a destination for music fans and Johnson acolytes. “He was so good that he would literally turn his back when they were recording him,” said the screenwriter Jimmy White (“Ray”), who is working on a script about Mr. Johnson’s life. “He didn’t want the other musicians to see his fingering technique.”."

2009-11-14T00:00:00Z,"MINOFF--Marvin, Producer passed away Wednesday night, November 11th, at home with his family and friends. He is survived by his wife of 29 years, actress Bonnie Franklin, his daughter Julie and her husband Glenn Mar, his son Jed and his wife Madoka, his two granddaughters, Natasha MarMinoff and Maya Grace Minoff, his brother Bruce and his wife Susan. He was the much-loved uncle of Melissa Minoff, artist Edward Minoff, and the godfather of Adam Bush. Born June 26, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York, Marvin attended Lincoln High School, Syracuse University and NYU before entering the U.S. Army, where he served in intelligence during the Korean War. Returning to New York, Minoff joined the William Morris Agency. In 15 years he rose quickly at two major agencies, William Morris and International Famous Artists (today's ICM), and became vice president of the motion picture department. He represented renowned actors, writers and directors such as Cicely Tyson, Sidney Lumet, David W. Rintels and Bruce Joel Rubin while packaging such blockbusters as ""The French Connection"" and ""Love Story."" His triumphs as an agent were always featured in Variety as ""Another success by Marvin Minoff, son of famed theatrical haberdasher Harry Minoff,"" a tip of the hat to his father, who owned a clothing store up the street. Minoff left the agency business in 1974 to become president of David Frost's David Paradine Television, Inc., where he co-produced with Frost the historic ""Nixon Interviews,"" as well as subsequent interviews with Henry Kissinger and the Shah of Iran. While at Paradine he also produced James Michener's ""Dynasty,"" ""The Ordeal of Patty Hearst,"" and ""Portrait of a Rebel: Margaret Sanger,"" starring his soon-to-be wife Bonnie Franklin. After leaving Paradine he continued as an independent producer until 1985, when he formed Farrell/Minoff Productions, a partnership with actor/writer Mike Farrell. The pair worked together for the next quarter century, producing motion pictures for television starring such luminaries as Shelley Fabares, Fred Savage, Helen Hunt, Tess Harper, Patricia Wettig, Jill Clayburgh, Missy Crider and Edward Asner, along with two features: the award-winning ""Dominick and Eugene"" starring Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta for Orion Pictures and Universal's ""Patch Adams,"" starring Robin Williams. A beloved and highly respected veteran of ""The show-biz wars,"" Minoff enjoyed the esteem of all those with whom he worked and was universally regarded as that rare thing in the business: an honest man. Services will be held Sunday at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills at 11am."

The Council of Wise Men, as the group is called, is composed of four men and one woman. It said the center-right coalition government, by making promises to cut taxes by 24 billion euros ($35.7 billion) in 2011, would make it much more difficult to curb the budget deficit."

But they remained steadfast in their support of Tyrone Ellis, a basketball player from Dallas. On the court, Ellis did something his fellow Americans had not done during the war: He fought for Georgia, and he won. The Georgian national team featuring Ellis became an unlikely success story, especially considering that its 2008 season began with an evacuation as bombs fell within earshot here in the capital. The Russian army bivouacked 30 miles away. Despite the war, the team won 9 of 10 games over two years and clinched Georgia's first berth in Division A, European basketball's biggest stage."

2009-11-14T00:00:00Z,"THOMPSON--Wade F. B.,69, of New York, NY and Old Black Point, CT died peacefully after a long, dignified battle with cancer. He is survived by his devoted wife of 42 years, Angela, his children, Charles A. Y. Thompson and Amanda Jane Thompson Riegel, his daughter-in-law, Olya A. Y. Thompson, son-in-law Richard E. Riegel III, and six grandchildren. Born in Wellington, New Zealand July 23, 1940, Mr. Thompson came to New York City in 1963 and received a scholarship to New York University. Prior to this, he graduated from Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, which in 2004 awarded him with an honorary doctorate to mark his achievements in business. After a lifetime of hard work and dedication, Mr. Thompson was chairman, president and CEO of Thor Industries Inc, the world's largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles and a major builder of buses in the United States. He co-founded Thor with his partner, Peter B. Orthwein in 1980 and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. Since arriving in New York 46 years ago, Mr. Thompson has been inspired to give back to his adopted city, most significantly in the founding of the Seventh 7th Regiment Armory Conservancy. For 15 years he worked tirelessly with Elihu Rose to save the Park Avenue Armory at 66th Street. His determination to preserve this important national landmark is finally a reality and for Mr. Thompson it stands as a monument to the city's character and quality of life. For their work on the armory project Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rose received the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis medal given by the Municipal Art Society for their outstanding contribution to the City of New York. In 2008 at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, Mr. Thompson received the Restore America Hero Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for his dedication to landmark conservation. The recent renovation of the landscape between Bethesda Fountain and the Loeb boat house in Central Park by Mr. Thompson and his family displays their dedication to improving the quality of all New Yorkers' lives. In recognition of their lifelong commitment to the park, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson received in June this year the Frederick Law Olmsted award from the Central Park Conservancy. A true believer in cancer screening and early detection, Mr. Thompson founded the Drive Against Prostate Cancer in 2000. The Drive, consisting of two Thor mobile medical vehicles, has traveled coast to coast offering free prostate cancer screenings to over 100,000 men, largely the under-served and armed forces veterans. Mr. Thompson, a five time cancer survivor himself, devoted enormous energy to funding cancer research. In 2007 he was the recipient of the Cancer Research Institute's Oliver R. Grace award for distinguished service in advancing cancer research. A man of great passion and dedication, Mr. Thompson will be remembered as a true New Yorker. A celebration of the life of Wade F.B. Thompson will be held at the Park Avenue Armory at 66th Street on Friday, December 18, 2009 at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Mr. Thompson's memory to the Park Avenue Amory, 643 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10065 or the Central Park Conservancy, 14 East 60th Street, New York, NY 10022."
