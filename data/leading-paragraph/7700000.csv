2013-05-04T00:00:00Z,"Over the last few weeks, moments sacred and profane have played out each night in the boxy, cinderblock sanctuary of Nativity Church on Second Avenue. The altar, candles and tabernacle have been put away, replaced by a bare-bones set where the youthful cast of “Stand-Up Tragedy” confront and comfort one another under the gaze of an unblinking Christ.
 
The church is a stand-in for the play’s Trinity Mission School, where an idealistic white teacher tries to save a bright but troubled Latino teenager. Its Lower East Side location lent the production a certain authenticity of place that appealed to Category 7 , which is staging this revival of Bill Cain’s 1989 play ."

Preview performances began on March 1 and since the official opening on April 1 the production has consistently grossed more than $1 million at the box office each week."

She has largely abandoned the traditional series of classical recitals and chamber concerts in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium in favor of nontraditional events related to Met exhibitions and, in many cases next season, actually taking place in the galleries.
 
The “gallery-hopping,” as a news release calls it, begins on Sept. 17 and 18, with “The Grand Tour,” celebrating completion of the museum’s new European Paintings Galleries, 1250-1800, with four early-music performances, successively featuring the ensembles Tenet , Dark Horse and Quicksilver and the harpsichordist Jory Vinikour , each in a different gallery. It continues on Sept. 28 with a day devoted to the composer and performer John Zorn (who will celebrate his 60th birthday on Sept. 2)."

Less populated areas use it less, the report found , so any change in the deduction is likely to be felt differently in various geographic areas. The analysis uses Internal Revenue Service state-level data from 2010 and ZIP code data from 2007 on the number of tax returns, the number of mortgage interest deduction claims, the amount of interest deducted and federal income taxes paid."

It was scheduled to run until June 30.
 
Although the production had a 25-week national tour before coming to Broadway, no plans were announced to move it to another location, either on Broadway or elsewhere. It is the latest show with music by Frank Wildhorn to flop on Broadway, a list that includes “The Civil War,” “Dracula,” “Wonderland” and “Bonnie & Clyde.”"

2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"“ Babe ” (1995) had a sweet, bucolic simplicity. The sequel, “Babe: Pig in the City,” (1998) directed by George Miller and one of the greatest of all fantasy movies, has a loony visionary magnificence. Mixing animatronics with live action, it seems at times like a giant Rube Goldberg machine, leading to disaster before delivering us to the release of slapstick. But this happy story of often melancholy enchantment also approaches the overwhelming empathy of a Vittorio De Sica film. A crippled dog dreaming of being able to happily chase butterflies in paradise would be at home among the poor, hopeful dreamers in De Sica’s “Miracle in Milan.” The prideful old orangutan insisting on dressing before he escapes from a laboratory might be a simian Umberto D.
 
The story has Babe, above, the sheepherding pig, and Farmer Hoggett’s wife (round, pink-cheeked Magda Szubanski) traveling to the city to earn enough money to save their beloved farm. They become separated and Babe winds up in a hotel that surreptitiously caters to animals, where he’s taken advantage of and then rallies the creatures to rise to the best versions of themselves. As only great humanist art can, the film returns you to the piercing primal sorrows of loneliness, hunger, losing the safety of home."

2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"1. Kelly Clarkson (Season 1; Finish: Winner)
 
It’s hard to believe now, but Clarkson was overshadowed for much of Season 1 by Tamyra Gray and Justin Guarini. But her big-band Judy Garland performance of “Stuff Like That There” set the standard for the whole series."
2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"The 1940s have always been the problematic decade of the golden era of American movies, bookended by the fresh, casual impudence of the ’30s and the neurotic unease of the ’50s. Great movies were made, but usually by directors (Preston Sturges, Orson Welles) or in genres (film noir) that pushed against the general cheer and wholesomeness, the tone much of Hollywood saw as its duty during wartime. Which is why, in the context of that determined normalcy, “Leave Her to Heaven” (1945) feels like such a shock. 
 
Here was a movie drenched in vibrant Technicolor and in the conventions of melodrama (the source was a best seller by Ben Ames Williams), starring popular, attractive performers, Cornel Wilde and Gene Tierney. It all promises Hollywood lushness, but at its cold little heart is Tierney’s Ellen, one of the most convincing and unsettling psychopaths in movies. She is an insanely possessive romantic who marries a successful novelist (Wilde) and sets out to eliminate every rival for her attention, including her unborn child and her teenage brother-in-law (Darryl Hickman, near left, with Tierney and Wilde), disabled from polio. Tierney doesn’t go in for histrionics. What’s frightening about her is how normal she can seem, even refined. Ellen allows her brother-in-law to drown in a lake, sitting a few feet away in a rowboat, her face absolutely impassive."
2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"A sturdy brow, speculative eyes, a smile that won’t turn on for just anybody or anything: If there’s one face you can trust, it’s Glenn Ford’s. Which is why Ford’s performance in Delmer Daves’s 1957 western “3:10 to Yuma” — as a murderous stagecoach robber who’s taken into captivity and does his damnedest to wriggle out of it — is both thrilling and unsettling. That movie is a world apart from “Jubal,” another Ford-Daves collaboration made just a year earlier. In “Jubal,” Ford plays the title character, an honest drifter who lands a job as foreman on Ernest Borgnine’s ranch, only to become ensnared in a trap laid by Borgnine’s randy wife, played by Valerie French. One picture gives us the Ford we want to believe in, straightforward and virtuous; the other gives us a Ford — wily, silver-tongued, seductive as all get-out — who uses our trust against us. How to choose a favorite?
 
Better, maybe, to just call it a tossup. It’s great fun to watch Ford in “Jubal,” shrinking from the advances of Ms. French’s frustrated, predatory ranch wife. He pities her and he fears her — she could cost him his job — but mostly he just wants to do the right thing. Ford’s Jubal may be the trustworthy sort, but that doesn’t strip him of his sexual allure. Understandably, he has to show a preference for the prim young miss from a just-passin’-through religious sect (Felicia Farr, who also appears in “3:10 to Yuma”). But Ford always stops short of being too nice — beneath his Sunday-school manners, there’s a hint of foxiness."
2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"That we’ve had time to get used to Mike Leigh’s mixture of caricature and naturalism makes it no less singular. The 20-something twins in Mr. Leigh’s “Life Is Sweet” (1990), one of the director’s peaks, can stand for the spectrum of his characterization. Natalie (Claire Skinner), a plumber who prefers the simplicity of men’s shirts and abjures the fuss of makeup, is entirely at home in her own skin. Her sister Nicola (the astounding Jane Horrocks, below left, with Ms. Skinner) is a gibbering mess of tics: she chain smokes, makes nasty remarks, has scratching jags in which she attacks her own skin and, barely hidden from her sister and parents (Alison Steadman and Jim Broadbent), is anorexic. It’s fitting that Ms. Skinner plays Natalie simply, and that Ms. Horrocks takes a stylized approach to a woman devolved into a mental and physical wreck. Mr. Leigh’s flexible methods accommodate both styles. 
 
In between are Ms. Steadman and Mr. Broadbent, capturing the cheerful personas that this middle-class couple, good parents still clearly in love, assume to deal with everyday life. It’s a measure of the humanism inside Mr. Leigh’s portraits that everyone is a candidate for grace. That comes in a scene in which Ms. Steadman confronts Ms. Horrocks, pouring out her fears and love for her daughter, risking losing her by making her emotions naked but realizing she will lose her if she stays quiet. It’s a scene whose pain and beauty you recognize you must live with from the moment you see it. ( Criterion ; May 28; Blu-ray, $39.95; DVD, $29.95) CHARLES TAYLOR"

The night before the wedding at the rehearsal dinner, there was a lot of partying, toasts and laughter. My dad took me aside and asked me to change the seating plans and seat them together. What should have been my beauty sleep was spent rearranging people at tables until 2 a.m. In the end, though, it was nice that they were able to put everything aside and act civil for my big day.

The Atlantic salmon and American eel each makes an epic voyage, but an eel’s greenish color, snakelike proportions and bottom-dwelling habits make it harder to love than a gleaming silver salmon. In terms of relative abundance and sheer toughness, the hands-down winner is the lowly American eel (Anguilla rostrata)."

To many educators, the answer seems obvious: Teachers who have fewer students can give each child more attention and tailored instruction. And parents agree. For years, annual surveys conducted by the New York City Department of Education have shown that the top priority of school parents is reducing class size , far outpacing “more effective leadership,” “more teacher training,” “more or better art programs,” “more challenging courses” and both “more preparation for state tests” and “less preparation for state tests.”"

2013-05-05T00:00:00Z,"Do you remember the last time you saw someone driving their family around in a gargantuan American station wagon as if they meant it? I’m not talking about a college student driving a load of friends around in granny’s hand-me-down or that weird neighbor who’s all “cold dead hands” about his ultimate suburban driving machine. No, I mean run-of-the-mill families of 4.5 who drive to schools, jobs and doctor appointments with mom and dad up front, a surly teenager or two in the back seat and one to one-and-a-half children way in the back, bouncing around on the rear-facing fold down, making faces at people through the back glass.
 
It’s probably been a while, if at all, since you’ve seen that, because the age of the full-size station wagon is gone. Not that our taste has drifted toward more diminutive, economical vehicles (the minivans, S.U.V.’s and pickup trucks that supplanted wagons are essentially the same thing). But the classic station wagon that was familiar to American driveways for decades fizzled into oblivion not long after General Motors ceased production in the mid-’90s of the bulbous behemoths better known as the Chevy Caprice and Buick Roadmaster estate wagons."

2013-05-06T00:00:00Z,"After more than 18 seasons in the major leagues, Yankees starter Andy Pettitte knows what the ball is supposed to feel like once it leaves his hand. There is a certain subtlety that makes it difficult for him to explain the feeling, but he knows by touch. He knows almost immediately after he throws a pitch how it will arrive at home plate without even seeing it land in the catcher’s mitt.
 
For the second game in a row, the ball did not feel comfortable coming out of his hand. Pettitte is releasing it at the wrong moment, and he knows it. The curveball that is supposed to loop down is instead floating sideways. He has lost the feel for his cutter, one of his signature pitches, and he cannot predict right now whether it will tilt sideways or back up."

She is survived by her three children Mike, Andrea, and Alison, five grandchildren Jessica, Joaquin, Amanda, Coryna, and Sofya; her sister Kathleen Lucas Barber, nephews Bob and John, and niece Ann. Barbara graduated from Bryn Mawr College (BA, philosophy, 1942) and Yale (MS Nursing, 1945; PhD Public Health, 1955) when women rarely pursued higher education. She was an Army nurse who cared for quadriplegic soldiers and researcher at Columbia University before moving to Stanford, CA with her husband, Halsted R. Holman, in 1960. While raising children, she continued her research. In 1970 she co-authored an article demonstrating that racial discrimination and work stress contribute to racial disparities in mortality, foreshadowing current research on health disparities, occupational health, and stress-related disease. Barbara was known for her quiet generosity, adherence to principle in the face of adversity, and her deeply-held belief that all people are equal and deserving of respect, regardless of class, race, ethnicity, religion, or sexuality. She passionately supported the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam war movements. In the 1980s, when HIV was devastating the gay community and gay men were being vilified, she ardently supported gay rights, especially through her love and support for her nephew, Charlie Barber, a gay rights activist. Her beliefs in the goodness of humanity and the power of education led her to support educational programs for underprivileged youth.

His company, Teledyne, became a remarkably successful and huge conglomerate, with an assortment of related — and unrelated — businesses. Like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Singleton was a modest man with a rare sense of rationality. He didn’t pay his shareholders dividends; he was convinced he could allocate the money more profitably.

2013-05-08T00:00:00Z,"To Shop: Is It a Bar? A Grocery? Actually, It’s Both

 
The full name of the hot new bar in the financial district is the Dead Rabbit Grocery and Grog. We get the grog part, but grocery? The mixologist Jack McGarry, who owns the bar with Sean Muldoon, also a mixologist, and the restaurateur Peter Poulakakos said it’s a tradition going back to the early 19th century, put in place to satisfy the temperance faction. “Bars had to sell food,” he said. “They were called spirit grocers.” So in the rear of the ground-floor bar are shelves of condiments, jams, canned seafood, chips and pickles (often English and Irish) and items like bitters, made in-house. “It’s mainly stuff that keeps, but we hope to add cured meats and cheeses,” Mr. McGarry said. “There are very few places to buy these things in this neighborhood”: Open 11 a.m. to 4 a.m., 30 Water Street (Broad Street), (646) 422-7906, deadrabbitnyc.com ."

I like it well enough, unless it’s overcooked, which emphasizes the mushy texture and slight bitterness that seem to repel so many. That tendency toward bitterness, especially when combined with the spinach in Mary McCartney’s dish of eggplant wraps , makes it a difficult pairing. I think of reds first, but nothing too tannic, which would clash with the bitterness. The sweet and spicy fruit of a lighter-weight zinfandel would work well. So might a lively Sicilian red like a nero d’Avola or a cerasuolo di Vittoria. Assertive whites would work well, too, like a sauvignon blanc, even a flamboyantly styled example, or a good, dry chenin blanc, like a Vouvray or Savennières.

Soda, coffee, tea and juice will soon cost $1.99 for basic- and economy-fare ticket holders. Water in a glass will be free, but not bottled water. Some members of Frontier’s frequent-flier program are exempt from the fee, which was announced in conjunction with a $25 to $100 fee to stow carry-ons for basic passengers who booked their ticket through a third-party site. The fees are expected to take effect this summer."
2013-05-12T00:00:00Z,"Why suffer through grumbling vacations with others when it’s so much more blissful to go it alone?

 
The first rule of travel is that you should always go with someone you love, which is why I travel alone. The writer’s life is more openly narcissistic than most, yet it takes a true connoisseur of self-involvement, a grand master in the art of selfishness, to experience the world’s delights as they are meant to be enjoyed: through one pair of eyes, via one set of ears, with the perfect use of your own nostrils, tongue and touch. I believe that traveling alone is the last great test of who you are in a world where everyone aches to be the same."

It is Public School 705, also known as the Brooklyn Arts and Science Elementary School, not the Exceed Charter School. (They are in the same building.)

On a quiet morning in the Umbrian hill town of Spoleto, Carla Fendi is pacing the stage of a 19th-century theater that now bears her name. “Come here,” she says, conspiratorially, in low-pitched Italian, taking me by the arm to inspect the back of a vast hand-painted stage curtain. She runs her index finger over the spots where conservationists sewed up tears and points out where gaping holes were patched with thermoplastic backing — all part of Fendi’s $1.5 million renovation of the theater. “I am in awe of the artisans who made this curtain whole again,” she says. “There were so many holes, they looked like clouds.”"

There, the German artist Tobias Rehberger has constructed Bar Oppenheimer, a facsimile of his favorite Frankfurt watering hole, which he describes as both a sculptural artwork and a utilitarian space. The space, which opens May 10 and will remain open until July 14, dazzles the senses with its salonlike atmosphere, tight dimensions and prismatic black-and-white stripes; it’s also a functional bar where anyone can stop in for a drink during the life of the project.
 
Bar Oppenheimer reflects Rehberger’s interest in creating sculptures, objects and environments that make references to humdrum mass culture while altering their spirit and import through the addition of color, textures and new dimensions. In 2009, the artist won the Golden Lion award at the 53rd Venice Art Biennale for his redesign of the event’s cafeteria, a white space he flooded with giant black polka dots, mirrors and dapples of bright pink and yellow. About his latest project, Rehberger said, “I love that this installation is essentially a little bar within a bar. And it reinforces my desire to create spaces that are paradoxical — spaces that, to look at, are both attractive and camouflaged.”"

Because they’re produced in the same basic colors, they can be mixed and matched easily. Beginning Monday, each designer will take a turn having a sale on OneKingsLane.com , offering several prints each for a few days at a time, with the proceeds benefiting a charity of the maker’s choosing. The first is Tracy Reese’s collection in support of AIDS Fund-New York Community Trust on May 13; the last is Jenni Kayne’s set to benefit Baby 2 Baby on June 18.

Citing this reason, the low-cost British airline EasyJet closed all its airport check-in desks last month and replaced them with bag-drop desks, following the lead of its competitor Ryanair, which removed its check-in desks in 2009. Now EasyJet passengers are encouraged to check in online beforehand and print their boarding passes before arriving at the airport or download them onto smartphones."
2013-05-12T00:00:00Z,"Nigel Peake’s rural Irish roots were the muse for his 2011 book of drawings, “ In the Wilds .” This year, the artist moved to Lausanne, the Swiss city on the shores of Lake Geneva, to teach architecture. The new setting influenced a series of 26 pen drawings that will be on view for a month starting today at the Paris boutique Colette . Peake’s “story of drawings,” as he calls it, tells the tale of a young boy who is afraid of the dark and takes solace in building boats. As with his other work, there is no visible human presence—the boy is only implied through images that hint at a larger narrative. For those who can’t make it to Paris to see the originals, Peake has self-published a limited-edition compilation of the images, called “In the Dark.” 
 
The precision of Peake’s drawings, which have been commissioned by the likes of Hermès, is what makes them captivating: through a strong awareness of geometry, he conveys a sense of peaceful stillness, spirited yet solemn. He does so with humble tools: “I like pens because you can carry them around in your pocket and use them to instantly make something,” he says. The context for his work, whether it’s self-published zines or campaigns for high-profile clients, doesn’t affect the way he makes it: “I love to draw, and so that remains,” he says."

 He’s huge. Standing there in the woods where I didn’t even see him at first. He doesn’t know I’m looking and then he moves a little bit and kicks the ground. I was walking by myself as the sun set. I kept going in deeper to the greenest spot until I found a clearing. He was the clearing. He took the clearing up and stood there still and watched me till I saw him. I saw his shoulders first and then his neck. I think he was so golden in the sun I didn’t know what he was. And I thought the branches were his horns. I thought he was an eight point stag. And how his chest made a kind of giant heart out of me out of my eyes looking. And he let me look. He stood there in the green not moving. I thought his horns were leaves. I saw eight branches coming from his head. He didn’t stop my looking. He didn’t run away. I watched the whole of him. I saw his arms and the taper of his legs. He let me watch him for maybe hours but really moments like a gift. Like when you’re almost home and smell them cooking supper but you’re still outside and could just turn back around. We stood like that together. He let me touch the whole of him. Every rise and muscle. He let me rest on the hollow of his neck and breathe it in for four whole breaths. He said my name or he shook his head inside the leaves and sighed and let the light come into us. He let the light hold us for a while."

One of urban life’s uncommon diversions is the chance to ransack the drawers of an anonymous neighbor. Airbnb is the Internet service, for those of you who don’t have a Danish architect leafing through your local Lonely Planet at your kitchen table right now, that lets “hosts” rent their extra bedrooms or entire apartments, mansions, tiki huts or goatskin yurts to travelers. In only five years, Airbnb has created a marketplace that offers 300,000 listings in 35,000 cities in 192 countries. It’s been so successful that half the tech start-ups these days go around flattering themselves with Airbnb comparisons: there’s an Airbnb for boats, and one for power tools, and probably one that will let you rent out your extra sheep to fertilize somebody’s lawn. Airbnb, for its part, might bill itself as a cheaper, roomier, warmer way to overnight — less deracinated than a hotel, but without the creaky-floorboard unease of a bed and breakfast — but the great unadvertised draw is the chance to spend time amid somebody else’s trappings."

The designs, Huniford says, are meant to be “user-friendly” — scale and contemporary livability are paramount, and dimensions, as well as upholstery, are all customizable. This is furniture that inhabits that elegant territory somewhere between modern and classic. A tufted slope-armed sofa ($7,800) is refreshed with a casual low-slung profile; a campaign-style side table ($4,800) is cheekily updated with a not-remotely-portable stone slab and chains; and a two-tiered occasional table ($5,800) has a brass base with an industrial feel. “I like the tension between contrasting materials,” the designer says. “Metal and stone, wood and glass.”"

2013-05-12T00:00:00Z,"WHILE A NEW GENERATION OF ARTISTS and designers are coming up with modern ways to reinterpret the classic combination of blue and white at the same time, its antique porcelain predecessor is hitting record highs at auction. Whether it is Valentino’s oversize florals, influenced by Delftware, on strict puritan-collared dresses, or Rem Koolhaas’s Casa da Música in Porto, Portugal, with abutting panels of traditional azulejos, the trend is unmistakable.
 
The cobalt compound that gives blue-and-white porcelain its color was brought to China from Iran by Mongolian invaders in the 13th century. Once its use as a pigment had been perfected, the great trade arteries that ran from East to West began to flow with new, distinctively patterned ceramics, spawning a mania for all things blue and white — to the extent that European and Ottoman factories began to produce their own hybrid designs in order to meet the insatiable demand. The craze gradually spread to interiors and textiles, from the tiled walls of merchant houses to gilded chinoiserie pavilions specially built to display princely collections of the precious porcelain."
2013-05-12T00:00:00Z,"It’s little surprise that the Japanese, who have a way of perfecting culture imported from abroad, would be drawn to the art of surf. Josh Rosen, a co-owner of the tastemaking lifestyle brand Saturdays Surf NYC , which opened a store in Tokyo last year, is frequently impressed by the meticulousness of “all the little accouterments”: cars outfitted with slots for surfboards and luggage racks that fold out as surfboard caddies; wet suits on hangers; and blankets to change on.
 
When he first surfed in Japan, Morgan Collett, Rosen’s business partner, was surprised by just how crowded the breaks were. The past five years have seen a major resurgence of interest in the sport, and in the breezy style that goes along with it. Takashi Kumagai, a stylist and photographer, notes that even nonsurfers love the laid-back look. In the 1970s, Tokyoites with no intention of getting in the water went so far as attaching boards to the roofs of their Volkswagen Beetles; these days, they might wear brightly striped pocket tees and beachy, slim-fitting chinos, like those sold at Saturdays — which, conveniently, just unveiled a second international outpost in the port city of Kobe. Junji Uchida, who edits two Japanese surf magazines, says the sport increasingly attracts urbanites who appreciate the outdoorsy lifestyle but aren’t necessarily interested in surf’s high-performance, competitive side, which dominated the culture in the ’80s and ’90s. These days, he says, it’s about being “fashionable, organic and healthy. During the week you work in the city, and on the weekends you go and hang out at the beach.”"

One of the founders of modern cell biology, Dr. de Duve was Andrew W. Mellon Professor Emeritus and a recipient of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with his Rockefeller colleagues Albert Claude and George Palade. Research by Dr. de Duve centered on the identification and characterization of the organelles of living cells. He is best known for his discovery of lysosomes, subcellular particles that function in many ways as the digestive system of the cell. This basic discovery underlies the current understanding of several inherited disorders, including Tay-Sachs disease and Gaucher's disease. In his later years, Dr. de Duve's investigations focused on the origins of life on our planet. In 1974 he founded the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, a biomedical research institute modeled on The Rockefeller University, at the Catholic University of Louvain. The institute was renamed the Christian de Duve Institute on the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1997. Dr. de Duve was a brilliant scientist and a gifted teacher, mentor and author.

Nantes has broken the Madame Bovary curse that’s turned so many other French provincial towns into snoozevilles. The city, recently named Europe’s green capital by the European Union, is now a popular weekend destination for eco-conscious Parisians who have been lured by the fresh air and a raft of exciting new hotels, restaurants and cultural spaces. Much of the activity is centered around the old docklands along the Loire, now home to effortlessly hip restaurants like L’Uni (36 rue Fouré), an adventurous modern bistro, and Les Bouteilles (11 rue de Bel Air), easily the city’s best wine bar, with plenty of Loire Valley vintages. Among the new hotels is the 28-room Sozo (doubles from about $140), built inside a 19th-century chapel with barrel-vaulted ceilings and original stained-glass windows. Best of all is Le Lieu Unique , a magnificent belle époque structure that was once an LU biscuit factory and is now a cultural center complete with a bar, a bookstore, a design shop and even a Moroccan-style hammam."

The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease. He was 87. Bert was born in Brooklyn, New York to Nathan and Bella Moll, immigrants from Eastern Europe. He attended Erasmus High, NYU, and Harvard Law School. During World War II, he served as a sergeant in the Army, stationed in the Philippines. Married to Nessa Ernstoff Moll for 55 years, they settled first in Rockville Centre and then Port Washington, both on Long Island. They later moved to Greenwich Village, Farmington Woods in Avon, Connecticut and then San Diego. Bert and Nessa shared a passion for politics, movies, theatre, The New York Times' Crossword, international travel, classical music and chocolate. Bert joined the Legal Department at Long Island Lighting Company and appeared on its behalf in the United States Supreme Court. He later joined Con Edison's Legal Department and subsequently moved into a business role as a Vice President, assuming responsibility for Con Ed's oil and then gas supply. He was dedicated to the communities in which he lived, serving on the school board and as a board member of Group House for troubled teens in Port Washington. Bert also served as a law guardian in the Nassau County Family Court. In Farmington Woods, he served on the Boards of the Home Owner's Association and Tax District. Bert was an ardent sports fan and had a love-hate relationship with the Yankees, Knicks and Jets. He enjoyed playing tennis and golf and could swish a set shot from 25 feet with admirable consistency. Bert's integrity, generosity and devotion to wife and family were an inspiration to all who knew him and will never be forgotten. In addition to Nessa, Bert is survived by his son Steve and his wife, Rhonda, daughter Laura and her husband, Dave, and daughter Julie and her husband Nick, as well as by grandchildren Karly and Nina, Evan and Jeremy, and Nate, Owen and Ben.

The report, issued on Monday, said that in the first quarter of the year, Apple took 57 percent of profit in the handset business, while Samsung took 43 percent. That shows substantial growth for Samsung’s phones. For comparison, in the first quarter last year, Apple raked in 74 percent of profit, and Samsung took 26 percent."

But the atmosphere suggested a more restrained version of the fervor exhibited by Beliebers. 
 
 Mr. Tveit (pronounced tuh-VATE), who starred on Broadway as Gabe in “Next to Normal” and as Frank Abagnale Jr. in “Catch Me if You Can” and on film as Enjolras in “Les Misérables,” has the dreamy good looks of a high school sports hero who elicits collective sighs of longing. The good news for Broadway and cabaret is that his charisma coincides with talent, discriminating taste in material and a modesty that doesn’t seem faked. His band — Bryan Perri on piano, Eric Davis on winds, Michael Blanco on bass, and Damien Bassman on drums — matched him in poise and precision."
2013-05-13T00:00:00Z,"Moviegoers ignored naysaying critics and swarmed to Baz Luhrmann’s stylized 3-D adaptation of “The Great Gatsby” over the weekend. But “Iron Man 3” (Walt Disney Studios) repeated as the No. 1 box office draw in North America, taking in $72.5 million, for a two-week total of $284.9 million. “Gatsby,” adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel and starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, sold about $51.1 million in tickets in second place — an astounding result for a period drama.
 
Although “Gatsby” received mixed-to-negative reviews , Mr. DiCaprio remains a “Titanic”-sized draw among women, and Warner Brothers backed “Gatsby” with a highly effective marketing campaign. Still, the film was not cheap: Warner Brothers and Village Roadshow spent more than $150 million to produce it (about $100 million after factoring in tax credits), according to trade media reports . And 3-D sales were soft: Only about 33 percent of ticket buyers opted to see “Gatsby” in that format."

2013-05-16T00:00:00Z,"STRICK--Louis, died peacefully on May 12th at age 87 following a brief illness. He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Elizabeth, his three children, Ivy, Wesley and Charlotte, a stepson, Simon, seven grandchildren, and two younger brothers, Walter and Stanley. He was raised in Flatbush, the son of Rosalind and Charles Strick. Growing up near Ebbets Field, Strick was an ardent fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1940, he became a member of the first class of Midwood High School. Strick went on to attend Cornell University. His college education was interrupted by World War II, and at age 19 he served as a staff sergeant in occupied Italy. After the war, Strick completed his undergraduate studies and went on to Columbia to pursue a Master's in Economics. He then wrote a weekly column on the stock market for the Journal of Commerce. Next he worked as a financial analyst for the investor Fred Stafford. In the late 1950's he purchased H.M. Storms, a manufacturer of ink ribbons; the National Cash Register Company would become his primary customer. During this period, Strick bought a radio station in St. Louis; WAMV was the first American station to play the hit song ""Volare."" In the early 1960's Strick co-founded a pioneering quality paperback line, Meridian Books, publishing Philip Roth among others. After selling H.M. Storms, he acquired Artone Ink, whose distinctive bottle featured the letter ""a"" in the form of an ink drip, an idea of Strick's that was designed by Push Pin Studios and gave rise to a popular typeface. In the late 1960's Strick began importing calligraphic art supplies that he distributed through his Pentalic Corporation. By making special nibs, pens and instruction books widely available, Strick spearheaded a revival of the calligraphic movement in America; he also established the Calligraphy Workshop, a school on lower Fifth Avenue. In the late 1970's Strick purchased the Taplinger Publishing Company, bringing out works of literary fiction and volumes on modern art, reflecting two of his passions. Strick himself was an artist who focused on collage; several of his pieces were exhibited in juried shows in Westport, Connecticut where he lived with Elizabeth for his last 32 years."

2013-05-18T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDER--Mary, of New York, Palm Beach, Mansfield, New Jersey and Bucharest, Romania died peacefully at home in her 85th year, May 16th 2013, fighting to her last breaths, so bravely and surely, after an illness that took all of her away except her essence that remained to say goodbye to this good life she loved so much and lived so well. Mother of Raluca Allison of New York; grandmother to Raleigh Allison and Percy Allison; most loving wife to Nicholas Alexander, deceased and terribly missed these past seven years. She will be missed by so many whom she helped when help was needed; by so many whose course of life she changed; and above all by her closest family who inherited and were inspired by her energy, her ambition, her spirit of adventure, her love of culture, her unquenchable desire to improve, her vast curiosity, her presence as the force of life she was. Born and educated in Romania, she went on to get a PhD in economics, attain a senior position in the Central Bank where she oversaw major industries; winning the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest recognition for professional service; and yet accomplished all this without political affiliation under a communist system she viscerally opposed, and, despite marriage to a man, the 50-year love of her life, who was a scion of one of the country's leading pre-communist families. Here was a woman who had the courage and vision to flee this oppressive system in her forties, leaving everything behind family, friends, job, prestige, home, belongings, money for freedom and dignity and prosperity in the United States, the adopted country she and her husband so loved and gave so much to, and, most of all, for the opportunity to give their one and only daughter, Raluca, a life worth living. And Mary did all this with no supports except her own drives and family. She did all this with false starts. She did all this having to learn in mid-life a new language and new ways. And she succeeded establishing a successful business in the great American entrepreneurial tradition; building homes and new family roots; sending her daughter to Yale and Columbia and on to a successful family and business life of her own; involving herself politically as she felt she must and attending two Presidential inaugurals as an emblem of her American commitment; following her longstanding interest in poetry, opera, and the life of the mind; and all the while enjoying all the little, daily things of life. The life force she was devastated as she was by the loss of her dearest Nick in 2006 and by the onset of a long Alzheimer's journey never once was lost, so much so, that to her very last breaths she knew her family and her family knew her and she fought with the final grains of her body's strength to say goodbye. She will be remembered and honored. She will inspire those who knew her. Most of all her spirit is a presence in the lives of her family and descendants who are happy at her peace even as they grieve at their loss. A funeral service will take place at St. James' Church at 11:00am., May 20th followed by a private burial service at the Princeton Cemetery. Donations to St. James' Church in lieu of flowers."

She gave media interviews telling her own story, urging women to find out if they have dense tissue, not itself abnormal but sometimes masking tumors in mammograms, and to inquire about further testing. She supported the organization, ""Are You Dense?,"" lobbied for the bill in Albany, and started an advocacy blog. The bill became NYS law in January, 2013. Hallie brought the same passion, intellect, and devotion to this cause as to her other interests and many friendships. Born and raised in NYC, Hallie went to the High School of Performing Arts, attended St. John's College in Annapolis, and graduated from the Santa Fe campus where she was editor of the college newspaper. Her career was varied, but never strayed far from her love of language and writing. She started collecting words at age 13 when she encountered hussar and bivouac in Tolstoy's War and Peace. ""I treat words I have just learned like new acquaintances; no matter how well we hit it off on a first meeting, I don't assume intimacy."" With her late father, the actor/impersonator Jan Leighton, she co-authored two books, Rare Words I and II (Levenger Press, 2003, 2008), which used humor to help master meanings. After college, Hallie worked at Random House and Knopf, was a writer's assistant on As the World Turns at CBS, and wrote columns for Cotton, Inc. that appeared regularly in Women's Wear Daily. She went to Israel in an arts program in the Negev, where she wrote about the Bedouin and stayed two more years because ""the adventure wasn't over,"" working with organizations that promoted peace between Arabs and Israelis. Back in the U.S. she became Director of Communications for Charity Brands, a firm that connected corporations with good causes. At the time of her death, she was working on a documentary on her father's unusual career he had played more roles than any other actor (2407) according to the 1985 Guinness Book of World Records. Hallie is survived by her mother, Lynda Myles, her Aunt Wendie Myles, her brother Ross Leighton, and a large, loving extended family. There will be a memorial service to celebrate her life and share memories at The Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, NYC, Thursday, June 13, 5:30pm. Gifts to support Hallie's favored charities can be made to the Jewish Communal Fund (att: Hallie Leighton Tikkun Olam Fund), 575 Madison Ave. #"

2013-05-19T00:00:00Z,"CRAWFORD--J. Hyde, Jr. 82, passed away peacefully at his home in Fort Lauderdale, FL on May 11th, 2013. Jay, as he was known to his friends, was the celebrated fashion illustrator for Bonwit Teller for 30 years as well as President and principal designer for Quadrille, the wholesale fabric and wall-paper company he founded. The only child of the late Nelda Francis Crawford and the late John Hyde Crawford, Sr., Jay was born October 16, 1930 in Jacksonville, FL. The family moved to Houston, TX and finally to Orlando, FL, where Jay attended High School. After graduation he studied art and fashion illustration at New York's Parsons School of Design and later was chosen to attend the prestigious Parsons European session. There he had exposure to not only fashion but to the world of interiors and outdoor painting. His room interior paintings are coveted to this day. After being graduated from Parsons he immediately began working for Bonwit Teller, the high end fashion store. In 1965 he was asked to update Bonwit Teller's violet logo which was reproduced on products from shopping bags to bathrobes. His fashion illustrations of haut couture designers such as Ungaro, Couregge, Cardin, and Calvin Klein could be seen daily in the New York Times. His impeccable eye and style easily translated to home decor, a talent that allowed him to design fabrics and wall-coverings, first for Woodson Wallpapers and then his own successful company, Quadrille. Jay assembled a substantial art collection, containing everything from dramatic 19th century European paintings to oversized canvases from the 1960s and '70s. With an artist eye he collected pieces not because they were deemed important, but because they ""worked"" in the environments where they were to be hung, thus becoming larger works of art. He is survived by his partner of 29 years Charles Andrews who is also now his husband. A private burial will be held in Salem, VA and a public memorial service will be held in New York City at a later date. In lieu of flowers donations may be made to SAGE, Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders, at sageusa.org/donate."
2013-05-19T00:00:00Z,"COX--William C.,Jr. William C. Cox, Jr., of Hobe Sound, FL and Nantucket, MA, passed away peacefully on May 1, 2013 surrounded by his family. He was 82. Bill was born on November 8, 1930 in Boston, Massachusetts to William C. Cox and Jessie Bancroft Cox. He was the great-grandson of Clarence Barron, the owner of the Boston News Bureau, who later acquired the Dow Jones news service in 1902. The Bancroft Family are the former owners of Dow Jones & Company Inc., publishers of The Wall Street Journal. Bill attended Dexter School in Brookline Mass, Brooks School in North Andover and Boston University. He served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. Bill's career at Dow Jones began in the late 1950s and would span over four-decades. In the 1960s he worked for the companys circulation services at their Chicopee, MA facility. While his career was spent on the business side of Dow Jones, he was a staunch supporter and steward of the journalistic integrity of the Wall Street Journal. In the 1970's, Bill moved to Detroit to be the mid-western advertising sales director of The Wall Street Journal. In 1976 Bill was elected to the Board of Directors of Dow Jones, a position he held for twenty-five years. In the 1980s he moved to London to help launch the European Edition of The Wall Street Journal. He returned to the United States in 1995 and served as the Journal's Executive Director of Client Relations, a position he held until his retirement in 2001. Growing up in Cohasset, MA, exposed to the equestrian world his parents loved, Bill realized his sporting interest lay outside of the riding ring. Much to his mother's consternation he never took to horses instead becoming an accomplished golfer, baseball player and ice hockey player, once being extended the opportunity to try out for the Boston Bruins. As a baseball player, he shared his mother's passionate support of the Red Sox. An avid golfer he cherished playing a round with friends or family. Bill was a long time member of the US Seniors Golf Association. He was also an accomplished outdoorsman who was equally at home in a Michigan duck blind or casting a plug for stripped bass and bluefish off Nantucket. Bill loved music and a good party. He especially enjoyed singing old Broadway show tunes or Cole Porter songs. Perhaps most notable was Bill's generous support to the communities in which he lived. He was a trustee emeritus of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation; trustee of The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Board member of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club and supporter of the Martin County Boys and Girls Club. As past president of The Sankaty Head Foundation, he took great pride in the Caddy Camp and its role in developing young men of character. Bill also served as a Commissioner for the Town of Jupiter Island, FL. Above all of his business, athletic, and philanthropic accomplishments, he was most proud of his family. He was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He is survived by his wife of 60 years; Martha W. Cox and their four children, William C Cox III, Ann Cox Bartram, Heidi Cox and Martha Cox Farrell, and 10 grandchildren, his sister Jane MacElree and his beloved dog Topper. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to The Nantucket Boys and Girls Club P.O. Box 269 Nantucket, MA 02554, The Nantucket Conservation Foundation P.O. Box 13, Nantucket, MA 02554 and the Sankaty Head Foundation, P.O. Box 875, Siasconset, MA 02564. Memorial Service will be 4pm, July 13, 2013 at St. Paul's Church in Nantucket."

2013-05-19T00:00:00Z,"ASHKIN--Beverly. Our darling mother Beverly Ashkin passed away gently on May 14 2013, a remarkable, wise, and courageous person loved by so many and capable of the most extraordinary love and compassion for everyone. Daughter of Anna Boisen one of the heroines of the historic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, who died when mom was only 18 months old, and Samuel, her beloved father who was forced to place her into an orphanage until she was nine years old, our mother would have celebrated her 85th birthday this September. She, and our father Sidney who passed away in 1992, were childhood sweethearts and lifetime soul mates who shared the truest and most profound love. Her gentleness towards everyone and every creature was the truest expression of her beautiful soul. Every lost, abandoned animal seemed to find its way into her embraces. So too, children and adults both, found understanding and a loving ear. Everyone who knew her, and even those who met her briefly would say the same thing: ""She is so lovely""; ""She is so elegant"". Her patience, tolerance, and wisdom; her ability to see things and accept others' perspectives, even when they were so different from her own; and her courage wrapped in softness and beauty: these were only some of her extraordinary gifts, made even more extraordinary because she was so unaware of how profoundly she touched those around her. This is how everyone will remember her, honor her, and continue to learn from her. But it is the two of us, her daughters, Roberta and Michelle, who will make sure that her light continues to shine and that we pass on the lessons that she imparted to us throughout our lives together. Donations in her honor would be appreciated to Defenders of Wildlife or the Humane Society of the United States."
2013-05-19T00:00:00Z,"ALEXANDER--Mary, of New York, Palm Beach, Mansfield, New Jersey and Bucharest, Romania died peacefully at home in her 85th year, May 16th 2013, fighting to her last breaths, so bravely and surely, after an illness that took all of her away except her essence that remained to say goodbye to this good life she loved so much and lived so well. Mother of Raluca Allison of New York; grandmother to Raleigh Allison and Percy Allison; most loving wife to Nicholas Alexander, deceased and terribly missed these past seven years. She will be missed by so many whom she helped when help was needed; by so many whose course of life she changed; and above all by her closest family who inherited and were inspired by her energy, her ambition, her spirit of adventure, her love of culture, her unquenchable desire to improve, her vast curiosity, her presence as the force of life she was. Born and educated in Romania, she went on to get a PhD in economics, attain a senior position in the Central Bank where she oversaw major industries; winning the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest recognition for professional service; and yet accomplished all this without political affiliation under a communist system she viscerally opposed, and, despite marriage to a man, the 50-year love of her life, who was a scion of one of the country's leading pre-communist families. Here was a woman who had the courage and vision to flee this oppressive system in her forties, leaving everything behind family, friends, job, prestige, home, belongings, money for freedom and dignity and prosperity in the United States, the adopted country she and her husband so loved and gave so much to, and, most of all, for the opportunity to give their one and only daughter, Raluca, a life worth living. And Mary did all this with no supports except her own drives and family. She did all this with false starts. She did all this having to learn in mid-life a new language and new ways. And she succeeded establishing a successful business in the great American entrepreneurial tradition; building homes and new family roots; sending her daughter to Yale and Columbia and on to a successful family and business life of her own; involving herself politically as she felt she must and attending two Presidential inaugurals as an emblem of her American commitment; following her longstanding interest in poetry, opera, and the life of the mind; and all the while enjoying all the little, daily things of life. The life force she was devastated as she was by the loss of her dearest Nick in 2006 and by the onset of a long Alzheimer's journey never once was lost, so much so, that to her very last breaths she knew her family and her family knew her and she fought with the final grains of her body's strength to say goodbye. She will be remembered and honored. She will inspire those who knew her. Most of all her spirit is a presence in the lives of her family and descendants who are happy at her peace even as they grieve at their loss. A funeral service will take place at St. James' Church at 11:00am., May 20th followed by a private burial service at the Princeton Cemetery. Donations to St. James' Church in lieu of flowers."

2013-05-21T00:00:00Z,"RESNICOW--Melly (nee Engelberg), 87, sister of Edward Engelberg, wife of the late Herbert Resnicow, mother of Norman, Eva, David, and Ruth and grandmother of Daniel, Joel, Natalie, Alexander, Nicholas, and Kyra, passed away on May 17 after leading a vigorous life. Born in Chemnitz, Germany, to Jakob and Paula Engelberg (nee Weber), Melly lived in Munich until age 13, when the family was forced to flee after her father was taken to Dachau. Her mother somehow negotiated his release and the family bribed its way into Switzerland with a painting. Settling in Brooklyn, Melly attended Erasmus High School. Although Melly did not speak English when she arrived, by her second year she won the top prize in the school's essay writing contest. At 15, upon her father's untimely death, she became the family breadwinner and worked as a diamond cutter for Harry Winston (where she sought to unionize the workers) while attending night school. She met Herbert Resnicow when he was on leave from Fort Dix and their romance continued via mail while he was stationed in Burma and India during the Second World War. They married in 1946, and as they built a family, lived first in a basement apartment in Brooklyn, then in a two-family house in Glen Oaks, and finally, a home in East Williston. For the next two decades, Melly focused on her family--placing an emphasis on education, the arts, and civic engagement-- also had a wide circle of friends. As her children got older Melly started taking college courses, earning a library and then a teaching degree. She taught English at Northport High School for 20 years. After retiring, Melly became a docent at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. Melly was smart, tough, and determined. She loved cooking, gardening, music, books, art, and above all her family. Donations in her honor can be made to HIAS: The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and The Museum of Jewish Heritage."

2013-05-31T00:00:00Z,"GALLANTZ--George G.,died of pneumonia April 24, the day after his 100th birthday. Born at home in a cold-water tenement, educated in East Harlem and Bronx public schools, George entered CCNY at age 15, the first in his family to attend college. He received his B.S. in 1932, then attended Brooklyn Law School, graduating cum laude in 1935. He soon distinguished himself as what his later colleagues at Proskauer Rose would call ""a lawyer's lawyer"". His most important work was as general counsel of the NBA, a position he held under its first three commissioners, and as a leading litigator at Proskauer, where he was a founding father of the field of sports law. He also served on the Brooklyn Law School Board of Trustees and as chair of the executive committee of the NYC Bar Association. But the bare facts, cases won, positions held, miss so much: beloved by younger, now famous, colleagues as a teacher, adviser, and mentor, he played the same roles with the same intensity to the immigrant children of his household staff. Justly remembered for his wit, intelligence, and total integrity, his most fitting epitaph might nonetheless simply be: ""You helped so many people"". His wife of 71 years, Laly, died in 2011, and he is survived by his son Michael, daughter and son-in-law Judy and Tony, grandchildren Abby and Ben, and great-grandchildren Micah and Emmet. His memorial will take place, Sunday, June 2, 1:00pm, at the NYC Bar Association, 42 W. 44th St. Send donations in his memory to the United Negro College Fund or the Center for Jewish History."

David was past President of the U.S. Tennis Association 1989-1990.

David was currently serving as a member of the USTA Major Construction Oversight Committee. An avid player and supporter of the sport, David was devoted to giving back to the game he loved so much. Prior to becoming USTA President, David was President of USTA Midwest, and is enshrined in both the USTA Midwest and USTA Eastern Halls of Fame. He also served as Chairman of the Davis Cup Committee, the Junior Tennis Council, and was, for many years, the official referee of the National 16-18 Boys Championships in Kalamazoo, MI. He was awarded the Samuel Hardy Award for long and outstanding service to the sport in 1991, and in 2010, was presented a USTA Volunteer Service Award for 40 years of devotion to tennis. There is a plaque on the outside wall of Arthur Ashe Stadium bearing David's likeness with an inscription that reads, ""His inspiration and hard work made Arthur Ashe Stadium a reality."" David was an avid art collector and served as a Trustee of the Museum for African Art soon to be opened in New York City.

2013-06-02T00:00:00Z,"MACE--Adelaide ""Bunny"" (Rowley). Passed away peacefully on May 22, 2013 at North Hill, in Needham MA. She was 100 years old and formerly lived in Dover, MA. The youngest child born into an academically distinguished family, Bunny was born January 7, 1913 in Minneapolis, MN, to Edith K. and Frank B. Rowley. She attended University High School in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1934 with a Fine Arts degree specializing in sculpture. Bunny followed her father in aviation and as a UM freshman became one of the youngest pilots of her time, earning her pilots license in 1930 flying an open cockpit American Eagle bi-plane. Although socially quite shy, during football season she loved to fly over the UM campus dropping tickets to the games from her open cockpit. She flew extensively over the Midwest, relying on road maps and water towers for navigation. She graced the cover of ""The Aerologist Magazine"" in 1930. In 1936, the pretty Pi Beta Phi member earned an MA from the Minneapolis School of Design, specializing in sculpture. Bunny married Myles L. Mace in 1937 and they moved to Cambridge, MA where he attended the Harvard Business School until posted in England for military service in 1942. They had two sons, Myles L. Jr., (Nick) and Terrence R. and lived in Concord, then Weston MA. In 1955 the family moved to Beverly Hills, CA while Myles helped found Litton Industries. When Myles returned to teaching at Harvard Business School in 1958, the Mace's moved to Dover, MA where they lived for 45 years. Bunny moved to North Hill in 2003 several years after Myles died. Intellectually curious, Bunny loved to travel. She arranged a series of family trips to Europe, and later an around the world adventure. Subsequently, she and Myles traveled extensively throughout the world. Her last trip, at age 89, taken with Nick and daughter-in-law Suzy, fulfilled her longtime wish to visit China. Recognized among Massachusetts horticultural societies for her extensive gardens and plant expertise, Bunny was an active member of the Garden Club of America, Noanett Garden Club and Winter Gardeners, receiving numerous awards for her impeccable gardens, arrangements, projects and displays. She was a long-standing member of The Country Club in Brookline, MA, the University Club in New York City and the Ekwanok Country Club in Manchester, VT.

Many generations of students and faculty have benefited from his passion for books, both in the classroom and in the galleries. During his long and distinguished career, Dale prepared more than 100 exhibitions and worked on 44 publications.

2013-06-02T00:00:00Z,"DOMAN--Glenn. Glenn Doman, 93, founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, died on the 18th of May. Doman was world-renowned for his pioneering work with brain-injured children and well children. In 1940 he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Physical Therapy. Study with Dr. Temple Fay at Temple University Hospital followed. On the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Doman enlisted and served as second Lt. Infantry Platoon Leader and Rifle Co. Commander in combat in Europe. He was decorated by George VI with the British Military Cross for outstanding heroism in action. From the U.S. he received the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in combat, the Silver Star for gallantry against an armed enemy, and the Bronze Star for heroism in close combat, and he was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was decorated for services to the Duchy of Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge. Following his discharge, Doman began pioneering the field of child brain development. In 1955 he founded The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential with the goal of successfully treating the brain. Doman and Fay believed that the brain had great capacity for recovery. At that time brain-injured patients were routinely warehoused and considered hopeless. Doman insisted, ""The brain grows by use."" Today the concept of neuroplasticity embraces the work of The Institutes. In the early 1960s, the successful work with brain-injured children led to vital discoveries about the development of well children. Doman authored ""The Gentle Revolution Series"" for parents, the first of which was ""How To Teach Your Baby To Read."" Doman taught more than twenty-five thousand families, and he strongly influenced millions of families through the book ""What To Do About Your Brain-Injured Child."" In 1966 he was knighted by Brazil and received that country's highest decoration, the Knight Order of the Southern Cross. In 2007 he received the Medal of the Italian Senate. He is survived by his wife, children, and grandchildren. His daughter, Janet, and his younger son, Douglas, continue to lead his dedicated staff around the world, ensuring that children both hurt and well continue to get the help they need. Donations may be made to The Founder's Fund at The Institutes, 8801 Stenton Ave., Wyndmoor, PA 19038, or iahp.org."

2013-06-04T00:00:00Z,"McCLINTOCK--Michael Robert, age 55, of Larchmont, New York, died on June 2, 2013. He was born to the late George D. McClintock and Aileen McHugh McClintock on August 20, 1957 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mike married Cynthia Ann Crowley on June 21, 1986 on Nantucket Island. Together they have three wonderful children: Christina Carey McClintock, Clare Melissa McClintock, and William Crowley McClintock, all of whom survive him. Mike is also survived by his four sisters and one brother: Jessie McClintock Kelly, Brooklyn, NY; Catharine R. McClintock, Edina, MN; George D McClintock, Purchase NY, Jane M Wyatt, Edina MN, Anne D McClintock, Medford MA. He was also beloved by his sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law: John Meeker, Binita Mehta, Wiz Wyatt, Catherine Poole, Melissa and Penry Price, Peter and Gretchen Crowley, and his parents-in-law Joan and Paul Crowley, and numerous nieces and nephews. Mike was a 1976 graduate of the Blake School in Hopkins, Minnesota. He graduated from Dartmouth College with a B.A. in 1980, and from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. in 1986. Since 2011, Mike has been a Senior Managing Director at Macquarie Capital, in the Financial Institutions Group. Previously he held senior positions at FBR Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets, Merrill Lynch, and JP Morgan. Mike was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Merchants Bank of Rugby, North Dakota, a family business established by his great-grandfather in 1898. Mike believed strongly in the importance of education and was very active as an alumnus of Dartmouth College. Always a fan of the Big Green, Mike worked tirelessly to encourage support for Dartmouth, and was inducted into the Stephen F. Mandel '52 Society in recognition of his extraordinary service to the College. He was also a member of the Board of Directors Catholic Youth Organization, Archdiocese of New York, a program he wanted to support after years of watching his children's CYO basketball games.

He was an avid skier, biker and golfer. He recently completed his first Olympic length triathlon and was so proud to finish after months of training. He also loved watching sports and cheering on Minnesota teams, but he took the most pleasure in watching his kids' sports and cheering loudly from the sidelines. Mike will be remembered for his smile and the generous way he celebrated the accomplishments of others. He always had handwritten notes tucked into pockets, and was frequently working on the speeches he gave for graduations, confirmations, weddings, birthdays and any special event for someone he loved. A sincere and loyal friend, Mike was always available to give good advice, offer a hug, or just listen and comfort. Mike was a devoted husband, and a wonderful father to his three children. His children knew that even though he worked hard, he would always be there at games, or at home to help with homework. He had a Teddy Roosevelt quote for every situation. Most importantly, he modeled a life of compassion for all. Mike was in love with his wife Cynthia, and through this love his children saw how trust and love build a strong family and a meaningful life. Visiting Hours Wednesday 2-4 and 7-9pm at Fox Funeral Home in Larchmont. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Thursday 10am at St. Augustine Church in Larchmont.

Our organizations will remember Senator Lautenberg as a great statesman, a dedicated proponent for public health and a strong advocate for all patients. As just one of his many successful initiatives, the Senator led the drive in Congress to improve professional education so all healthcare providers nationwide have the tools they need to recognize, diagnose and treat the too-often overlooked disease of lupus. The Senator was equally passionate about protecting the country's commitment to advancing biomedical research. As recently as this spring, Senator Lautenberg co-hosted a Senate briefing on lupus to apprise Congress of the imperative need to protect scientific advances and assure strong support to the National Institutes of Health. On behalf of people with lupus as well as those suffering with any challenging disease, we thank Senator Lautenberg for his years of turning concern into action and compassion into legislation, said Richard DeScherer, President of the S.L.E.

2013-06-08T00:00:00Z,"HOMES--Herbert Charles. 86, of Bronxville, NY, and Nantucket, MA, beloved husband, father, grandfather and friend, passed away peacefully after a brief illness on Wednesday, June 5th. Born in New York City on November 21, 1926, he was the son of the late Frieda and Charles Homes, 1st generation Americans. He was a graduate of the High School of Music and Art and NYU Business School. He met his wife of 64 years, Shirley Williams Homes, while at Emerson College in Boston. Herb was a WWII Veteran of the Air Force. Through the GI Bill, he attended The School of Radio and Television Technique, and his destiny was set. When offered a one-day job in the Channel 11 WPIX mail room, he used his charms and skills to advance into directing major productions at PIX. He directed and produced ""The Ted Steele Show"", a live variety show of the 1950's. He also directed and produced the popular WPIX schedule of children's shows i.e. ""The Chuck McCann Show"", ""Bozo the Clown"", ""Officer Joe Bolton"", ""Captain Jack McCarthy"" and more. After a brief stint at Colpix Records, and weekends directing live news briefs at the RCA Pavilion at the New York World's Fair, Herb joined the early years of Channel 13 WNET in 1967. He ran production in the heyday of public television and was producer/director of the Channel 13 Auction. Over the decades, as his negotiating skills became evident, he was named Director of Labor Relations where he remained until his retirement at 80. Having spent nearly 60 years in television, Herb continued to enjoy summers in his cherished home on Nantucket with his wife and a parade of family and friends. He will be missed more than words can say a finer and funnier man we've never known. He is survived by his wife Shirley Homes, sister Phyllis Lewis, daughter Pat Catchpole, son Peter Homes and his wife Gina, grandchildren Alexandra Catchpole, Jessica, Jeffrey, Judith, Jenn and JR Homes, many nieces and nephews, and a fan club too big to list. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Nantucket Conservation Foundation, www.nantucket-conservation.org. A gathering to share memories of Herb will be held Saturday, June 15th, 1pm at McGrath Funeral Home, 20 Cedar Street in Bronxville, with a nosh to follow."

2013-06-08T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSMITH--Hank (Herman) L. The lawyers and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the untimely passing of our beloved partner, colleague and friend Hank Goldsmith. Hank waged a valiant battle against his illness over the past year, displaying the unyielding optimism he brought to life every day and the toughness that made him such a formidable legal talent. Throughout his struggle, Hank made clear to all of us how deeply he loved his family. Nothing meant more to him than his sons Eric, Jake and Ryan Goldsmith. Indeed, no conversation with Hank was complete until the latest event involving each boy was discussed in depth. He adored his wife Debbie and embraced his stepsons Avery and Ethan Kriss with his characteristic warmth because no disease could ever diminish his immeasurable heart. Hank received a B.A., cum laude, from the State University of New York at Binghamton and earned his J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center in 1987. He spent nearly his entire legal career at Proskauer and became a Partner in 1997. A brilliant trial and appellate lawyer, Hank represented clients in the financial services, real estate and entertainment industries. In two of his most significant cases, he represented the recording industry trade group in the copyright case against Napster and acted as lead counsel on an important amicus brief for a number of international copyright holders in the U.S. Supreme Court. Hank loved to teach and countless Proskauer litigation associates developed under his tutelage and guidance. The enormous appreciation that Hank's clients had for his work was perhaps best expressed by the number who surrounded his bedside over these past few weeks. Hank loved the practice of law, the firm and his clients and the feeling was mutual. He had a unique wit that he used as a lawyer to persuade and as a friend and colleague to entertain. No one was quicker with a quip to illustrate a point. And in the tradition of great lawyers who were artists in their off hours, Hank was a skilled guitarist, bass player and singer who performed in several tribute bands most recently The Newspaper Taxis (Beatles), the Carjackers (the Cars) and the Petty Thieves (Tom Petty). Proskauer extends its deepest sympathies to his wife Debbie, sons Eric, Jake and Ryan Goldsmith and stepsons Avery and Ethan Kriss. Hank and Debbie showed us all the power of love and devotion, inspiring hope in the human condition at a time when we might otherwise have only felt grief. Hank never faltered or despaired despite the challenges he faced. That was a gift to his friends and colleagues and, most of all, his family. Joseph M. Leccese Chairman Proskauer Rose LLP"

Born in New York City on November 21, 1926, he was the son of the late Frieda and Charles Homes, 1st generation Americans. He was a graduate of the High School of Music and Art and NYU Business School. He met his wife of 64 years, Shirley Williams Homes, while at Emerson College in Boston. Herb was a WWII Veteran of the Air Force. Through the GI Bill, he attended The School of Radio and Television Technique, and his destiny was set. When offered a one-day job in the Channel 11 WPIX mail room, he used his charms and skills to advance into directing major productions at PIX. He directed and produced ""The Ted Steele Show"", a live variety show of the 1950's. He also directed and produced the popular WPIX schedule of children's shows i.e. ""The Chuck McCann Show"", ""Bozo the Clown"", ""Officer Joe Bolton"", ""Captain Jack McCarthy"" and more. After a brief stint at Colpix Records, and weekends directing live news briefs at the RCA Pavilion at the New York World's Fair, Herb joined the early years of Channel 13 WNET in 1967. He ran production in the heyday of public television and was producer/director of the Channel 13 Auction. Over the decades, as his negotiating skills became evident, he was named Director of Labor Relations where he remained until his retirement at 80. Having spent nearly 60 years in television, Herb continued to enjoy summers in his cherished home on Nantucket with his wife and a parade of family and friends. He will be missed more than words can say a finer and funnier man we've never known. He is survived by his wife Shirley Homes, sister Phyllis Lewis, daughter Pat Catchpole, son Peter Homes and his wife Gina, grandchildren Alexandra Catchpole, Jessica, Jeffrey, Judith, Jenn and JR Homes, many nieces and nephews, and a fan club too big to list.

2013-06-09T00:00:00Z,"GOLDSMITH--Hank (Herman) L. The lawyers and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the untimely passing of our beloved partner, colleague and friend Hank Goldsmith. Hank waged a valiant battle against his illness over the past year, displaying the unyielding optimism he brought to life every day and the toughness that made him such a formidable legal talent. Throughout his struggle, Hank made clear to all of us how deeply he loved his family. Nothing meant more to him than his sons Eric, Jake and Ryan Goldsmith. Indeed, no conversation with Hank was complete until the latest event involving each boy was discussed in depth. He adored his wife Debbie and embraced his stepsons Avery and Ethan Kriss with his characteristic warmth because no disease could ever diminish his immeasurable heart. Hank received a B.A., cum laude, from the State University of New York at Binghamton and earned his J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center in 1987. He spent nearly his entire legal career at Proskauer and became a Partner in 1997. A brilliant trial and appellate lawyer, Hank represented clients in the financial services, real estate and entertainment industries. In two of his most significant cases, he represented the recording industry trade group in the copyright case against Napster and acted as lead counsel on an important amicus brief for a number of international copyright holders in the U.S. Supreme Court. Hank loved to teach and countless Proskauer litigation associates developed under his tutelage and guidance. The enormous appreciation that Hank's clients had for his work was perhaps best expressed by the number who surrounded his bedside over these past few weeks. Hank loved the practice of law, the firm and his clients and the feeling was mutual. He had a unique wit that he used as a lawyer to persuade and as a friend and colleague to entertain. No one was quicker with a quip to illustrate a point. And in the tradition of great lawyers who were artists in their off hours, Hank was a skilled guitarist, bass player and singer who performed in several tribute bands most recently The Newspaper Taxis (Beatles), the Carjackers (the Cars) and the Petty Thieves (Tom Petty). Proskauer extends its deepest sympathies to his wife Debbie, sons Eric, Jake and Ryan Goldsmith and stepsons Avery and Ethan Kriss. Hank and Debbie showed us all the power of love and devotion, inspiring hope in the human condition at a time when we might otherwise have only felt grief. Hank never faltered or despaired despite the challenges he faced. That was a gift to his friends and colleagues and, most of all, his family. Joseph M. Leccese Chairman Proskauer Rose LLP"

He took the challenges and complications inherent in managed care and spun them into a compelling vision where the Church's commitment to social justice was continuously given new outlets and opportunities for serving the poor, pursuing the greater good, and reflecting the love of Jesus. By colleagues and friends, he was referred to as ""a hard worker who labored in the Lord's vineyard"" and a ""star of the priesthood"" who possessed the unique ability to encourage lively discourse and debate, and provide cogent and effective reflections that led to consensus while never wavering from his values or his innate sense of kindness. All facets of his life were integrated into one unified personality and presence that was respected, admired, and revered by all. The hearts of the greatest servants are forged by an uncommon passion to instill hope while walking side by side with those most in need. Bishop Sullivan walked this walk for a lifetime, and we are proud and blessed to have joined him along the way. He is truly irreplaceable, and will be greatly missed. The Board and Staff of Fidelis Care New York"

2013-06-15T00:00:00Z,"McTAGUE--John Paul, 1938- 2013. a distinguished scientist who impacted the world of science in research, academia, industry and government, died on Friday, June 7, 2013 at the age of 74 at his home in Montecito, California. John McTague graduated from Xavier High School in New York, NY. Growing up in Jersey City, he met and married Carole Frances Reilly, to whom he was married 35 years when she passed in 1997. A physical chemist, John McTague received his undergraduate degree with honors in chemistry from Georgetown University in 1960 and his Ph.D. from Brown University in 1964. Brown also bestowed on him an honorary Sc.D. in 1997. He was a technical staff member at North American Rockwell Center from 1964 to 1974 and a professor of chemistry and a member of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCLA from 1970 to 1982. There and at Riso and Brookhaven National Laboratories, he led experiments in the structure and dynamics of condensed phases. He then became the first chair of the National Synchrotron Light Source Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Following his position as Chair of the National Synchrotron Light Source, he was appointed as Deputy Director then Acting Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Reagan. He then joined Ford Motor Company in 1986 as Vice President of Research and then Vice President of Technical Affairs until his retirement from Ford in 1999. He was a founder of cooperative automotive research efforts, including USCAR and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. During the first Bush Administration, he was a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and U.S. chair of the U.S.-Japan High Level Advisory Panel on Science and Technology. Dr. McTague was founding co-chair of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Operations Board, and a member of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board from its inception in 1990 through 2000. In 1992, he was a founding member of the University of California President's Council on the National Laboratories and was the first chairman of the council's Technology Transfer Panel, serving on both until 1995. From 1994 to 1999, he was also chairman of the Fermilab Board of Overseers. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has received Alfred P. Sloan, John Simon Guggenheim, and NATO Senior Fellowships, as well as the California Section Award of the American Chemical Society. In 1998 the American Physical Society honored him with the Pake Prize ""For insightful experiments and contributions...for major contributions in management of science in government, national laboratories, and industry; and for championing new paradigms for collaboration, such as the Partnership for New Generation Vehicles."" In 1999 he was the honored recipient of the Glenn T. Seaborg Medal at UCLA for his achievements in academia, government and industry and for significant contributions to chemistry and biochemistry. At that time, McTague announced the endowment of the Reiss Chair, which honors another UCLA professor and also established the John P. McTague Career Development Chair at UCLA, which supports outstanding junior faculty in UCLA's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. McTague said ""When I was a professor at UCLA, the department was very supportive. There was a great sense of collegiality, of community. Helping to bring in and nurture younger members of the community, early in their careers, has more leverage than other ways of giving support,"" says McTague. ""I saw this as an opportunity to say thank you, and to help a superb public university stay competitive with private schools and preserve the excellence of faculty and students."" In his later career years, McTague served as vice president of laboratory management for the University of California, Office of the President, and then as a Professor Emeritus of Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In retirement John McTague continued to enjoy his favorite things: his family and travel. In this leisure time he ventured to Antarctica, Dubai, Egypt, Bali and favorite places like New York City. His children and grandchildren were the most important things to him; he created a legacy of bringing the whole family together for vacations in Barbados and creating great family memories. John McTague is survived by his four children; son, Kevin (Christine) McTague of Santa Barbara, CA; daughter, Catherine (Douglas) Bregenzer of San Anselmo, CA; daughter, Margaret (Daniel) McCreary of East Longmeadow, MA; and daughter, Maureen (Mark) Sandoval of Orinda, CA; along with nine grandchildren and his sister Mary (Andrew) Dempsey of Hilton Head, SC. The family will hold a private memorial in late June. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The John P. McTague Career Development Chair Endowment in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA. Checks may be made payable to the UCLA Foundation, noting Fund Number 8986 in the check memo line.

2013-06-16T00:00:00Z,"SELIGSOHN--George Joshua, 90, died peacefully on May 11 at his home in Florida. George grew up in the Bronx and Brooklyn at a time when there were still some dirt roads in New York City and horses were sometimes seen pulling delivery carts. As a child, he was known for bringing home stray dogs, his tremendous curiosity, and his six-year old solo forays across the Brooklyn Bridge to visit his father Sam's law office. In the 1930s, his family moved to Belle Harbor, Rockaway Beach. George was a 1940 graduate of Far Rockaway High School where he was a member of the honor society and excelled on the math team. Originally admitted to the Cornell University Class of 1944 with a Regents Scholarship, George was graduated in 1943 with a BA in Physics. He was recruited to work at Oak Ridge, TN and served in the US Army Signal Corps. After receiving his law degree (NYU, 1953), George became a patent attorney, with a career (at RCA in Princeton, NJ, and in private practice in Florida) that spanned almost 60 years and brought him deep engagement and satisfaction. In Rochester, NY, he worked at Stromberg-Carlson and was a member of Toastmasters. In East Windsor, NJ, where George lived for 24 years, he was a member of Kiwanis and volunteered as a math tutor for children in need, while practicing patent law at RCA and then GE at David Sarnoff Research Center. He was one-of-a-kind, and will be remembered for his sense of justice, his generosity, his humility, his equanimity, his intelligence, and his trademark point-of-view. He often quoted great writers to most pithily make a point. A favorite quotation, reflecting his love of his profession, was, ""Work is the greatest of all virtues, because it simultaneously overcomes poverty, vice, and boredom,"" from Voltaire's Candide (1759). A man who cared about function, not appearance, he would remind us, ""Vanity of vanities; all is vanity."" (Ecclesiastes 1:2) His matter-of-fact acceptance of the flow of life was embodied in, ""The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it."" (from The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam). He lived by his motto, ""Live and let live,"" truly not judging or seeking to control others. George was consistently a person of great honesty, loyalty, and nobility. George is survived by his wife of 51 years, Phyllis, his three children, Diane, Steven, and Laura; five grandchildren, Juliet, Isabelle, Hannah, Tivon, and Lachlan, his brother, Leo, and his sister, Nancy. George will continue to be deeply missed. His family requests that donations in his honor be sent to the George J. Seligsohn Far Rockaway Scholarship Fund, which, starting this June, will benefit students excelling in math and science in the academies now housed at the Far Rockaway High School Campus. Donations can be mailed to George J. Seligsohn Far Rockaway Scholarship, PO Box 334, Fairfax, CA 94978-0334. A memorial in George's honor is being planned, date and location to be announced."

2013-06-16T00:00:00Z,"McTAGUE--John Paul, 1938- 2013. a distinguished scientist who impacted the world of science in research, academia, industry and government, died on Friday, June 7, 2013 at the age of 74 at his home in Montecito, California. John McTague graduated from Xavier High School in New York, NY. Growing up in Jersey City, he met and married Carole Frances Reilly, to whom he was married 35 years when she passed in 1997. A physical chemist, John McTague received his undergraduate degree with honors in chemistry from Georgetown University in 1960 and his Ph.D. from Brown University in 1964. Brown also bestowed on him an honorary Sc.D. in 1997. He was a technical staff member at North American Rockwell Center from 1964 to 1974 and a professor of chemistry and a member of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCLA from 1970 to 1982. There and at Riso and Brookhaven National Laboratories, he led experiments in the structure and dynamics of condensed phases. He then became the first chair of the National Synchrotron Light Source Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Following his position as Chair of the National Synchrotron Light Source, he was appointed as Deputy Director then Acting Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Reagan. He then joined Ford Motor Company in 1986 as Vice President of Research and then Vice President of Technical Affairs until his retirement from Ford in 1999. He was a founder of cooperative automotive research efforts, including USCAR and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. During the first Bush Administration, he was a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and U.S. chair of the U.S.-Japan High Level Advisory Panel on Science and Technology. Dr. McTague was founding co-chair of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Operations Board, and a member of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board from its inception in 1990 through 2000. In 1992, he was a founding member of the University of California President's Council on the National Laboratories and was the first chairman of the council's Technology Transfer Panel, serving on both until 1995. From 1994 to 1999, he was also chairman of the Fermilab Board of Overseers. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has received Alfred P. Sloan, John Simon Guggenheim, and NATO Senior Fellowships, as well as the California Section Award of the American Chemical Society. In 1998 the American Physical Society honored him with the Pake Prize ""For insightful experiments and contributions...for major contributions in management of science in government, national laboratories, and industry; and for championing new paradigms for collaboration, such as the Partnership for New Generation Vehicles."" In 1999 he was the honored recipient of the Glenn T. Seaborg Medal at UCLA for his achievements in academia, government and industry and for significant contributions to chemistry and biochemistry. At that time, McTague announced the endowment of the Reiss Chair, which honors another UCLA professor and also established the John P. McTague Career Development Chair at UCLA, which supports outstanding junior faculty in UCLA's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. McTague said ""When I was a professor at UCLA, the department was very supportive. There was a great sense of collegiality, of community. Helping to bring in and nurture younger members of the community, early in their careers, has more leverage than other ways of giving support,"" says McTague. ""I saw this as an opportunity to say thank you, and to help a superb public university stay competitive with private schools and preserve the excellence of faculty and students."" In his later career years, McTague served as vice president of laboratory management for the University of California, Office of the President, and then as a Professor Emeritus of Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In retirement John McTague continued to enjoy his favorite things: his family and travel. In this leisure time he ventured to Antarctica, Dubai, Egypt, Bali and favorite places like New York City. His children and grandchildren were the most important things to him; he created a legacy of bringing the whole family together for vacations in Barbados and creating great family memories. John McTague is survived by his four children; son, Kevin (Christine) McTague of Santa Barbara, CA; daughter, Catherine (Douglas) Bregenzer of San Anselmo, CA; daughter, Margaret (Daniel) McCreary of East Longmeadow, MA; and daughter, Maureen (Mark) Sandoval of Orinda, CA; along with nine grandchildren and his sister Mary (Andrew) Dempsey of Hilton Head, SC.

He was 80 years old. Luckily two days before, he was surrounded by his loving family. Bill was born on January 14, 1933 in Englewood, New Jersey to Helen Mary G. Clark who was a well know WAFS pilot in World War II, while the US Air Force was still part of the US Army and to W. Gerould Clark, Jr. who was the mayor of Englewood, New Jersey. Bill graduated from Cornell University in 1955 with a BA in Economics and an MBA. He had an illustrious career in the reinsurance industry. Bill spent 22 years at General Reinsurance after serving as an Officer in the U.S. Air Force as a MATS pilot. As Senior Vice President at General Reinsurance Corporation, Bill led the Facultative Division to be recognized as the premier market for this reinsurance product. In particular, his leadership and innovation led Casualty Facultative to prominence within the reinsurance market. Following four years as President of Transinsco, a subsidiary of Gulf Oil Corporation, Bill was instrumental in spearheading and founding several more reinsurance companies - including Clarendon National Insurance Co., Transamerica Reinsurance Co. and TIG Re. ""More than his corporate contributions, Bill impacted many lives in the re/insurance industry with his innovation; his positive attitude, charm, vibrancy and enthusiasm; his promotion of talents and skills throughout; his magnetism; his leadership and management style. He believed in ""meritocracy"" and in team brainstorming. Bill's impact will live on in the people that had the privilege to know him and work closely with him!"" (Recent quotation from past colleagues). Bill is survived by his adoring wife Tania, four sons William G. Clark, Jr. (Sarah H. Clark), Michael W. Clark (Colleen F. Clark), Jonathan B. Clark (Alice S. Clark) and Timothy A. Clark (Vincianne V. Clark) and two stepsons Allen C. Post, Jr. ""Casey"" (Sarah L. Post) and John S. Post ""Jeep"" (Jessica G. Post), thirteen grandchildren and his brother W. Gerould Clark II. Bill's interests spanned a wide variety of subjects. He was an accomplished equestrian and pilot, loved building and decorating his homes and had great fun captaining his own classic boats. He was a mentor and father to so many and a beloved husband who will be greatly missed for his endless optimism, his ""terrifics"" and 'absolutely fabulouses"". He brought joy and harbor to us all. Bill's smiling blue eyes will sparkle in our hearts forever.

Ruth was the youngest of five daughters born to Max and Celia (Socolof) Mindlin in East Orange, New Jersey on August 27th, 1915. The Mindlin sisters were exceptionally close all of their lives. Lillian Semel, Pauline Forman, Mildred Burstein and then the baby, Ruthie, followed Sadie Aaron, the eldest. When Bert Weinberg interviewed head counselors for his family's summer camp, Pocono Highland, Ruth landed the job and a husband in the bargain. Ruth and Bert were married in 1939 and had four children; the late Patricia Lee Smith (Dr. Robert), Nancy Winston (late Laurence Levine, late James V. Higgins), Max Weinberg (Rebecca), and Abby Levin (Michael). Ruth leaves eight grandchildren who adored her beyond measure; Dr. Michelle Goncalves (Manny), Dr. Nicole Steckler (Matt), Sharon Boyd (Scott), Dani Kupperman (Justin), Ali Weinberg, Jay Weinberg, Jake Levin, Noah Levin and 11 great grandchildren, Alexa, Jack, Lina, Noa, Amanda, Sabrina, Ben, Joseph, Finn, Bryce and Layla. Ruth Weinberg taught physical education in the Newark School System for 26 years and with Bert owned and operated Pocono Highland Camps in Marshall's Creek, PA and Laurel Lake Camp, in Tyler Hill, PA. She was a lifelong member of Hadassah as well as Temple Sharey Tefilo-Israel of the Oranges. Her father, Max, was one of the founding members of Sharey Tefilo in East Orange. She loved Broadway musicals, Hershey bars, organizing and winning at Mahjong and Canasta and being with her large and loving family of which she was the very proud matriarch. Ruth traveled the world with her son Max, drummer with the E-Street Band. Members of the band always called her ""Mighty Mommy,"" and mighty she was. She will be greatly missed. A private graveside service will be held on Monday, June 17th, with a future memorial to be announced."

2013-06-17T00:00:00Z,"SOROS--Paul. Paul Soros, of New Canaan, CT, New York City, and Nantucket, MA passed away after a long illness on June 15, 2013, at age 87. He is survived by Daisy, his loving wife of 62 years, their sons Peter and Jeffrey, daughter-in-law Catharine; his adored grandchildren Preston, Simon, Sabrina, Thomas, step-granddaughter Stella Powell-Jones, and by his younger brother, George. Paul Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1926. After surviving the Nazi and Soviet occupations of World War II, he skied for the Hungarian National Team until the 1948 Olympics in St. Moritz and then emigrated to the United States on a scholarship in 1948. He graduated from Polytechnic Institute of New York University in 1950 and worked for a year in heavy construction before joining Hewitt-Robins International as a sales engineer. He and his wife Daisy met while both were studying in New York and were married in 1951. In 1956 he founded the engineering firm Soros Associates. Over the next 30 years Soros Associates was recognized as the leading international engineering firm in the design and development of bulk handling and port facilities. The firm won the American Engineering Council's Annual Excellence Competition Award 18 times, received the 1983 Award of Outstanding Materials Handling Engineer from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the 1989 Outstanding Engineering Achievement Award from the National Society of Professional Engineers. The firm also received the Gantt Medal from ASME in 2000. Mr. Soros holds several patents related to his innovations surrounding material transport and was the author of more than a hundred technical articles. During this time, he also served as a delegate to the U.S.-Japan Natural Resources Committee under President Johnson, as a member of the White House Panel on Science & Technology under President Nixon, and as Special Ambassador of the U.N. on missions to Morocco, Jordan and Czechoslovakia. After the firm was acquired in 1989 by ENI, the Italian energy company, he continued to focus on his related business interests in resources and shipping, and his philanthropy. He was a member of the board of Quantum Industrial Holdings as well as several of its portfolio companies. He also served on the board of Brooklyn Polytechnic, TechnoServe and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His contributions to public life earned him several distinctions including the Fulbright Award for Contributions to International Understanding and election to the Hall of Distinction by the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities. He received honorary doctorates from Bates College, Macaulay Honors College and Polytechnic Institute of New York University. He and his wife played an active role in the support of many New York institutions including International House, Weill Cornell Medical School, The Metropolitan Opera, The New York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center, where they underwrote Midsummer Night Swing for many years. One of his proudest achievements was the establishment in 1997 of The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. These fellowships were created to recognize the contribution of immigrants to America and identify future leaders in their fields. Under the direction of the family, together with a distinguished board of trustees, the Fellowships each year provide support to 30 immigrants and first-generation Americans in pursuit of their graduate studies. A memorial service will be held at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, the 27th of June at 11am. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to International House or the New York Philharmonic."

2013-06-18T00:00:00Z,"SOROS--Paul, If the American dream had a patron saint, he would look a lot like Paul Soros, who achieved so much himself and then supported the highest aspirations of this country's most talented immigrants through the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. The world lost a remarkable intellect and visionary. We will miss his wit and charm and generosity. Our heartfelt condolences to Daisy, Peter, and Jeffrey and the Soros family. Ann Kirschner Dean, Macaulay Honors College of The City University of New York Director, The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans"
2013-06-18T00:00:00Z,"SOROS--Paul. His passing on June 15, 2013 at the age of 87 is deeply mourned by the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans Program and the 475 Soros Fellows whose graduate study it has funded over 16 years. The Program has been informed by Paul's inspiring personal story, his commitment to American constitutional democracy, and his visionary philanthropy. As an 18-year-old in Hungary in 1944, Paul assumed a false identity and survived the Holocaust era. When the Soviets invaded Budapest, he was arrested, became a Russian prisoner of war, and escaped while in transit to Russia. A member of the Hungarian Olympic ski team in 1948, he defected, initially to Austria and subsequently to the United States. His experiences under both Nazi and Communist regimes awakened in him a powerful and enduring commitment to the American constitution and Bill of Rights. He believed that active and informed citizenship is essential to the protection of our democracy. And he was convinced that immigrants and others who have recently achieved citizenship have a special responsibility to support and defend our constitutional system. As an extremely promising young engineering student in New York City - he met his wife-to-be, Daisy, at International House - Paul struggled to afford graduate study. A Master's degree from Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, however, launched his distinguished career as a creative, innovative, and highly accomplished civil engineer. His innovative ideas, and his determination to see them implemented, transformed port design worldwide. Paul and Daisy's lives as immigrants informed and shaped their decision to fund and personally support a national graduate fellowship program that helps launch careers of New Americans. It supports individuals whose creativity and drive suggest that they have special promise of making distinctive contributions to American life. It recognizes that such individuals can be found at more and less distinguished institutions throughout the country. And it emphasizes and encourages active citizenship among its Fellows. Paul was especially proud of the contributions that Paul & Daisy Soros Fellows have already made to American life. They, and all of us who play roles in implementing his vision, mourn his passing and pay tribute to the enduring legacy of his wisdom and philanthropy. We extend our deepest sympathy to Daisy, their sons Peter and Jeffrey, and their families. A Memorial Service honoring Paul's life will be held on Thursday, June 27th at 11am at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center. Stanley Heginbotham, Director Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans"

2013-06-18T00:00:00Z,"SOROS--Paul. Paul Soros, of New Canaan, CT, New York City, and Nantucket, MA passed away after a long illness on June 15, 2013, at age 87. He is survived by Daisy, his loving wife of 62 years, their sons Peter and Jeffrey, daughter-in-law Catharine; his adored grandchildren Preston, Simon, Sabrina, Thomas, step-granddaughter Stella Powell-Jones, and by his younger brother, George. Paul Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1926. After surviving the Nazi and Soviet occupations of World War II, he skied for the Hungarian National Team until the 1948 Olympics in St. Moritz and then emigrated to the United States on a scholarship in 1948. He graduated from Polytechnic Institute of New York University in 1950 and worked for a year in heavy construction before joining Hewitt-Robins International as a sales engineer. He and his wife Daisy met while both were studying in New York and were married in 1951. In 1956 he founded the engineering firm Soros Associates. Over the next 30 years Soros Associates was recognized as the leading international engineering firm in the design and development of bulk handling and port facilities. The firm won the American Engineering Council's Annual Excellence Competition Award 18 times, received the 1983 Award of Outstanding Materials Handling Engineer from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the 1989 Outstanding Engineering Achievement Award from the National Society of Professional Engineers. The firm also received the Gantt Medal from ASME in 2000. Mr. Soros holds several patents related to his innovations surrounding material transport and was the author of more than a hundred technical articles. During this time, he also served as a delegate to the U.S.-Japan Natural Resources Committee under President Johnson, as a member of the White House Panel on Science & Technology under President Nixon, and as Special Ambassador of the U.N. on missions to Morocco, Jordan and Czechoslovakia. After the firm was acquired in 1989 by ENI, the Italian energy company, he continued to focus on his related business interests in resources and shipping, and his philanthropy. He was a member of the board of Quantum Industrial Holdings as well as several of its portfolio companies. He also served on the board of Brooklyn Polytechnic, TechnoServe and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His contributions to public life earned him several distinctions including the Fulbright Award for Contributions to International Understanding and election to the Hall of Distinction by the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities. He received honorary doctorates from Bates College, Macaulay Honors College and Polytechnic Institute of New York University. He and his wife played an active role in the support of many New York institutions including International House, Weill Cornell Medical School, The Metropolitan Opera, The New York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center, where they underwrote Midsummer Night Swing for many years. One of his proudest achievements was the establishment in 1997 of The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. These fellowships were created to recognize the contribution of immigrants to America and identify future leaders in their fields. Under the direction of the family, together with a distinguished board of trustees, the Fellowships each year provide support to 30 immigrants and first-generation Americans in pursuit of their graduate studies. A memorial service will be held at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday, the 27th of June at 11am. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to International House or the New York Philharmonic."

2013-06-18T00:00:00Z,"PIELENZ--Hanns A. Died June 13, 2013 at his home in Vero Beach, Florida with his beloved wife and daughters by his side. Pielenz, who alternated between residences in Vero Beach, Bonnigheim, Germany and Harbor Springs, Michigan passed away after a brave and valiant battle against myelofibrosis that began more than two years ago. Hanns Alfred Pielenz was born in Heilbronn, Germany on November 22, 1939. After a stint in banking, he returned to school and graduated from the Academy Hohenstein in 1963 in Textile Management-Engineering. He joined Amann/Ackermann Group, a regional textile business that was founded by his maternal great grandfather in 1854. From 1968 until his retirement in 2005, Mr. Pielenz was Chairman and CEO of the company and under his stewardship the provincial textile manufacturing company became a dominant and innovative leader in the global textile industry. Pielenz's contributions to the industry were recognized in 2009 as he was the first recipient of the Otto-Mecheels Medal for his contributions and innovations to the textile industry. While at the helm of Amann, he was also the Chairman of URS, an Atlanta based refrigerated warehouse company and commuted to Atlanta to manage the company. Under his visionary guidance, URS became one of the largest refrigerated warehouse companies in the US before he sold it in 1997. Knowing he would retire from Amann in 2005, he formed a family office in Atlanta, Georgia in 2000, HAP Investment Group, LLC, and used it as a platform for a multitude of investments including real estate, venture capital, angel investing for start-ups and minority ownership in operating companies. Pielenz loved business and was interested in any investment that provided the opportunity to create value as well as fuel his passion for knowledge and his acumen for business strategy. Pielenz was a brilliant business strategist with a personality and presence that was bigger than life. He loved people and they loved him as he left an indelible mark on everyone he interacted with over the years. He was a mentor to many in the business world and was always eager to provide input, guidance, and motivation though he always set high expectations and empowered people to reach them. He leaves behind a legacy few will fulfill in life as his business contributions provided jobs for thousands of people in many different businesses spread around the globe. His business creed was ""Close ties to the customer and knowledge of the market are the essentials of business success. The secret is passion."" This was not only the motto for his business but his philosophy for living his life as he was passionate about the things he valued. While business strategy was a passion, he dearly loved being in the woods, either hiking with his wife or hunting and he loved golf...though he admitted with pride that his wife was the better golfer. His greatest passion was his family, his wife of 45 years, Christa, who he always referred to as his sweetheart, his daughters, Nici and Katja, and his four grandchildren. Since his diagnosis in 2011, Pielenz worked tirelessly to fund, develop and coordinate resources to find a cure for myelofibrosis. While his efforts were not in time to change his destiny, his legacy will be to continue this research for all of the others suffering from this disease. Hanns Pielenz is survived by his wife, Christa Herzog Pielenz, his daughter Nicola Dowling (Colin), his daughter Katja White (Houston), and his grandchildren Maxie Klemm and Colin, Nicholas and Claire Dowling. The family would like to express its heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Srdan Verstovsek of MD Anderson as well as the entire team in the Leukemia Department who worked tirelessly to help not only Mr. Pielenz but his family on the journey as he battled myelofibrosis. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made in his memory to the MPN Clinical Research Center under the direction of Dr. Srdan Verstovsek, Department of Leukemia (Unit 428), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030 or The Boys and Girls Club of Vero Beach, 1729 17th Ave., Vero Beach, Florida 32960.

2013-06-18T00:00:00Z,"KROLL--Sol. We mourn the loss of Sol Kroll. He arrived as a young immigrant child through Ellis Island, lived a long and very full life, had a wonderful marriage to Ruth, four children, devoted and loving grandchildren, adorable great-grandchildren, upon all of whom he showered unequivocal and unconditional love. This brilliant multi-talented, erudite, gracious, tough as nails but sweet as sugar, full of mischief, master of the universe was a unique individual possessed of an indomitable spirit who rose to great success personally and professionally. During his early years, Sol was a politician in Putnam County, New York where he served as its County Attorney from 1960-1964. After leaving politics, Sol Kroll became a legend in the field of insurance law (an Elector to the Insurance Hall of Fame) and the first truly global insurance lawyer. Starting in the 1950's when he traveled by boat continuing in the jet age -- he opened up the English, Japanese and European insurance marketplaces for American lawyers. He was featured in the Institutional Investor magazine for his 30-year tradition of hosting the opening cocktail party each year at the Rendez-vous de Septembre, the annual Reinsurance conference in Monte Carlo. As an insurance lawyer for 71 years, he worked closely with Lloyd's of London and was the first U.S. General Counsel to the Institute of London Underwriters. He represented France in negotiating insurance aspects of tax treaties with the United States and Sweden in major insurance M & A transactions. Among his most celebrated cases, Sol was respondent's counsel in Bing v. Thunig where the New York Court of Appeals eliminated the concept of charitable immunity in the State of New York. Forty-years ago, he pioneered the concept of multi-state law firms when such firms, commonplace today, were virtually non-existent. He also pioneered the concept of ""claims made"" insurance that became the universal form of professional liability insurance that is used today. He was particularly proud of his 20-year service as a Director of the Insurance Federation of New York and, at his death, remained a Director Emeritus. In his spare time, he was a sculptor and a poet. One of his sculptures, Mr. Internet, remains on display at the University of Alabama. For decades, Sol was Chairman of the U.S. Friends of the London Symphony Chorus. He will always be in our hearts."

In 2007, Bill and Maggie Kaplen helped launch the JCC Gift of Community Capital and Endowment Campaign with a lead gift. In grateful appreciation the JCC now proudly bears their name. Mr. Kaplen once stated: when you engage in philanthropy, you realize that you are not really giving anything away. You're multiplying what you have a hundred times over and keeping it for yourself.

2013-06-19T00:00:00Z,"GOLUB--Sharon, passed away on June 16, 2013 of pneumonia. Sharon Bramson grew up in Far Rockaway with her sister Bunny and her parents Ray and Hy. At 16, brilliant and determined, she left home to enter nursing school. At 20, when she was the Head Nurse on her unit, she met the man who would become her husband of 49 years, Leon Golub. Soon after they married, they began a family. Lawrence, then David arrived to make their family complete. When her boys began going to school fulltime, Sharon went back to college, eventually earning a PhD in Psychology. She had a professional career full of milestones and accomplishments. She was a college professor, an author of multiple books on menstruation and women's lives, a long-time editor of the journal Women & Health, and a dedicated psychotherapist. She became a Professor at the College of New Rochelle, and her students sought her guidance not just in their studies, but in life. She accomplished all this while also a loving mother and devoted wife. Reluctantly, some years after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Sharon made the sacrifice of retiring before she became unequal to her own high standards. She faced her Parkinson's disease with courage and grace and refused to let it prevent her from living. She loved to paint, to go to the theatre with friends, to swim, to sing, and to dance as best she could. And she loved the wii. Most of all, she and Leon loved their role as grandparents and doted endlessly on their six grandchildren. She collected friends, maintaining an array of friendships that in many cases lasted most of her life. Their love supported her through to the end. Through innumerable physical challenges, her spirit would only briefly wane, but never for long. Each time she would rally back and live as full a life as she could. She died as she lived, peacefully and surrounded by a loving family and friends. She is survived by her sister Bunny, her sons and daughters-in law, David and Lisa and Lawrence and Karen, her six grandchildren, Lucy, Jack, Elena, Ben, William and Kate, and her grand-dog Buddy. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Michael J. Fox Foundation."

The Kaplen JCC on the Palisades mourns with profound sadness the loss of Wilson Kaplen, a visionary and philanthropist who dedicated his life to making a difference. He worked tirelessly on behalf of both Jewish causes and the community at large with a generosity of spirit that is well known. For more than 50 years, Mr. Kaplen demonstrated unparalleled support for our JCC. He was a founding member, a long time Board member, Vice President from 1966 - 1970 and remained active on the Board of Advisors until the present. Dedicated to the JCC's mission, Bill established the Kaplen Family Gym in 1986. In 2000, the JCC adult day care program for those suffering with Alzheimer's and dementia was renamed the Kaplen Adult Reach Center in recognition of Bill and his wife Maggie's personal investment in the welfare of the elderly. Their unwavering support of this program has been both personal and financial. In April 2003, the JCC presented the Kaplens' with the Chaver Award to acknowledge their dedication to enriching the quality of life for everyone who enters our doors. The Kaplen's became the Diamond Sponsors for the 2003 JCC Maccabi Games, enabling our Center to serve as a point of entry for Jewish teens from around the world. They also established The Kaplen Youth Athletic Endowment Fund to provide Maccabi scholarships for all deserving teens in our community. The athletic delegation to the games from our Center is named the Kaplen Team Palisades in their honor. In 2007, Bill and Maggie Kaplen helped launch the JCC Gift of Community Capital and Endowment Campaign with a lead gift. In grateful appreciation the JCC now proudly bears their name. Mr. Kaplen once stated: when you engage in philanthropy, you realize that you are not really giving anything away. You're multiplying what you have a hundred times over and keeping it for yourself. He lived by these words and will be remembered for his wisdom, guidance and leadership. We send our sincerest condolences to his wife Maggie, their four sons, Lawrence (and wife Veronica), Alexander, Peter and James and their three grandchildren, Nicolas, Benjamin and Isabelle.
