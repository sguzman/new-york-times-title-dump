1901-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Is the Spanish war or Mr. Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage"" responsible for the new group of civil war novels written by authors whose knowledge of the contest is derived from books and from tradition?

1901-06-22T00:00:00Z,"PROBABLY the history of the White family as to whether derived, as far as a name goes, from the Jutae or Viti, interests us no more than would similar studies relating to the Browns or Greens. Suffice it to say that Gilbert White sprang from a fairly well-to-do and educated stock. But means and education do not make a man a naturalist."

1901-06-22T00:00:00Z,"Strangely enough, Democrats in Washington are reported as expressing the fear that BRYAN will retain his personal popularity to a degree sufficient to enable him to secure a third nomination from the new party in the West or from some other organization of his admirers, and so defeat the candidate of the Democratic Party in 1904."

1901-06-22T00:00:00Z,"We think of America as very young, and if at any time we are in danger of losing the feeling we are constantly reminded of it by our foreign visitors, mostly critical.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,"The good done by the starlings throughout the Spring, Summer, and Autumn is incalculable. The young are fed entirely on insect food, and as the birds always seek this as close to home as possible they act as police to our gardens, and meadows.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,"A dense fog which settled over the harbor yesterday, humidity which settled over the mainland, and temperature of real Summery character, made the day an exceptionally disagreeable one in New York.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,To the Editor of The New York Times: The discomforts and inconveniences of street-car travel in this city are certainly apparent to everybody; but just how to remove them is a problem not easily solved.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,Russia has but a faint conception of law and justice. In this she is the exact opposite of the Roman people.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,"From the earliest times up to the middle of the eighteenth century, the only method by which steel was made was by heating wrought iron in close contact with charcoal, or some carbonaceous material.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,"Visitors to Central Park yesterday who selected the locality about the Casino and the East Drive to enjoy their outing discovered an innovation in the way of long rows of green-painted rocking chairs.

1901-06-23T00:00:00Z,"Gen. Joe Wheeler is good to the interviewer. He talks out without reserve, as if speaking to a friend.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"It is an odd coincidence that Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer's article upon ""John Fiske and the History of New York"" should have happened to appear in the number of The North American Review following Mr. Fiske's death. The ordinary reader might have imagined that it was both published and even written in view of that event."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Seven Colorado steers that arrived at the Central Stock Yards, Jersey City, on Thursday, stampeded from their pens at 11 o'clock that night and created wild excitement in the north part of the city and county from that time until 4 o'clock yesterday morning. Two of them were finally shot, two were captured, and the other three at last accounts were still at large somewhere on the meadows along the Hackensack River."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LOUIS MARIE JULIEN VIAND, or as he signs himself, Pierre Loti now about fifty years of age is as well known in naval as in literary circles. His first book, ""Aziyade,"" was published about twenty-five years ago, to be followed by a long line of successors; the present volume, ""The Story of a Child,"" now first translated into English, having been first published in France about ten years ago."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Considerable effort -- of a purely conversational sort -- seems to have been expended by the more civilized citizens of Carrollton, Miss., to prevent the triple lynching in which the savages of the place indulged on Thursday night, but even the better part of the community showed that they shared to some extent the prevailing contempt for the law as a substitute for summary vengeance inflicted on victims chosen almost haphazard."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"There was a lively meeting last night of the District Committee of the Republican organization of the Twenty-fifth Assembly District at the quarters of the Madison Square Republican Club, 1,146 Broadway. It was expected that there would be a show of hands in the fight in progress against the continued leadership of McDougall Hawkes."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"BOSTON, Aug. 2 -- The market went wrong again to-day. Gradual declines for several of the specialties were shown and pronounced weakness was developed in spots. The conditions, however, were about what had been anticipated, if anything, a little better. The steel strike situation is still a bearish force of much potency."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"SIR WALTER BESANT'S little posthumous volume about King Alfred the Great, which comes from the press of D. Appleton Co. this week, was written expressly for the Appletons' Library of Useful Stories, and no one can fail to perceive by some introductory remarks that its preparation was a lobor of love."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 2 -- Nearly all the important local stocks sagged to-day, but the losses were small. It seems that the concessions generally were made to spur the market and make sales. Choctaw warrants, after selling at 11, receded to 10 1/2 and insiders had bids of 10 for all that might be offered."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 -- The Navy Department has not announced its selection at an officer to complete the Schley court of inquiry in place of Rear Admiral L.A. Kimberly, retired. In his letter of declination on the ground of illness, Rear Admiral Kimberly said:"

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"In the last pages of Frank Burlingame Harris's story, the hero, Newton Mills, reveals the simple mystery of his incognito. Until then he had worKed as a farm hand with the Ridgebys, who met him accidentally after he had, hero fashion, thrashed a bully. Newton, of course, fell in love with the educated, beautiful, yet sensible, Sibley, an adopted daughter of the old farmer."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"The Committee of Fifteen is pushing its crusade against the social evil in tenements. Under the new tenement house law, with the assistance of the Health Board, it has already succeeded in driving from the tenement houses a number of objectionable persons."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,Very interesting in view of the present widespread desire for a better knowledge of the doings and belongings of our forefathers is this account of the Colonial furniture of America. The authoress has zealously consulted the available records of the times in order to obtain and give a comprehensive idea of what quantity and quality of furniture our ancestors had in their estates.
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"The graceful title of Post Wheeler's new volume of poems embodies the poetic name of a flower. This the author applies to a theme of love, around which the other poems cluster. In the central group there is a suggestion of a story of passionate love ended by death, and in the sequence of these songs one of the best is the following:"
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Dr. Alvah H. Doty, Health Officer of the Port of New York, yesterday began his crusade against the plague of mosquitoes at Concord, near Clifton, S.I. Dr. Doty was at Concord until dusk, and he accomplished much toward the carrying out of his plans to render a malarial district healthy."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Transactions on the Stock Exchange yesterday still further dwindled, the total number of shares traded in falling below 375,000 -- of which over 90,000 were Steel common and preferred. The main topic of discussion was still the delay in settlement of the steel strike, though, inconsistently enough, the Steel shares held much firmer than the railroad list."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"SUCCESSFUL book collectors are by no means always those whose libraries contain the greatest number of examples of early printing and artistic book-making, or the longest rows of first editions and autograph copies. A man may have spent a fortune for his books and never really made a lucky find in some dusty little shop."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"George C. Thomas, the Consolidated Exchange broker, who had been notified by Col. Thompson of the Internal Revenue Service to come to the latter's office to earrested for violation of the clause in the War Revenue act relative to the placing of stamps on stock sales, arrived at the Federal Building yesterday just as the clock struck 12."

The first week will be devoted to the national amateur championships and the second week to the international meet, which will include both amateur and professional events."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"You are not expected by the author of ""L19,000"" to be in the least worried about the fate of the personages in his story. You are to take pleasure in his ingenuity, and nothing more. The inclination is to laugh. It is so infinitely ludicrous to mix up the bodies of two dead men in the cabin of a steamer."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Frank Moss, head of the Society for the Prevention of Crime, and the police of the Mercer Street Station were at loggerheads for more than an hour yesterday afternoon, the controversy involving a discussion as to the definition of a poolroom.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"TRENTON, N.J., Aug. 2 -- A serious charge was to-day preferred by Counsellor W. Holt Apgar against the members of the jury which recently convicted Music-dealer H.J. Burtis on a charge of petty larceny and malicious mischief. Mr. Apgar charged them with having violated their oath by convicting Burtis by lot, instead of by ballot."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"It would not be easy to exaggerate either the social or the political importance of the conviction of BISSERT. That the police habitually levy blackmail on disorderly houses and that many Police Captains have only this way of reimbursing themselves for the blackmail levied upon them by Tammany Hall -- these are facts which nobody doubts and which, by the nature of the case, it is extremely difficult to prove."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 2 -- The short-loan market was much easier to-day. The supplies of money were augmented through large disbursements of dividends and also owing to the recent borrowing of L3,500,000 from the Bank of England. The ease is expected to be temporary, inasmuch as the bulk must be repaid by to-morrow."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 2 -- The Barbary Maid, gelding, (Thorpe), won the race for an allaged selling plate, distance six furlongs, at the Goodwood race meeting to-day. Lilly Palmer, (""Clem"" Jenkins), was second, and Kilmantle came in third."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, Aug. 3 -- A bitter discussion arose in the House of Commons last night over the Colonial Office appropriation.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 2 -- Steps toward the consolidation of the various district freight and passenger departments of the railroads, and the subsequent reduction of district forces, which move has been anticipated, are being taken.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"It would be unfair to Mr. John Trotwood Moore to assert that he was no lover of nature and that ""A Summer Hymnal, a Tennessee Romance,"" was the outcome of a realizing sense that the public mind was attuned to a cordial reception of birds and books. ""The Summer Hymnal"" may have been the sincerest outpourings of the author's heart, but the manner of the outpouring is unfortunate."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"To The New York Times Saturday Review Will you not kindly, either editorially or otherwise, give your readers a little dissertation on the business side of authorship? So frequently do I find articles which say that manuscripts should be timely, that the author should submit unreservedly to the decision of the editor, and then end up by saying that the author will succeed if he has business ability!"

""Through the streets of Plymouth poured the vast throng of people."" Along marched Capt. Benjamin Church with his regiment. The centre of excitement was around the gory head of King Philip, which was borne aloft."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"These sermons are quite typical of the modern pulpit spirit which wanders far afield from the Bible for its texts. They are frank, genial attempts to get the nut tram the husk of common things, to find the ""veins of glory and fire"" that transfigure ordinary duties and elevate plain every day behavior into a flattering resemblance to heroism."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"It is hardly to be assumed that the recent action of the National Educational Association has disposed of the question of a National university. That would not have been the case had the action of the association been never so deliberate. Since it was not deliberate at all, but hasty and ignorant, it will not have much influence except on the reputation of the association."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"CHICAGO, Aug. 2 -- George H. Phillips, the corn speculator, gave out a statement to-day, in which he says that the George H.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"BUFFALO, July 31 -- Here is a great exposition, planned to celebrate American achievement, which virtually ignores literary accomplishment. There are book exhibits a few, but there is no historical exhibit to show either the evolution of American bookmaking, or to indicate by any means whatever the richness of the field of American authorship."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Protestant church attendance in New York this Summer is so small as to excite remark.

He has got so far as to secure the pretty complete sway of his party organization, but he is painfully aware that that is not enough."
1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"Very little business was transacted in the outside market yesterday.

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,"LONDON, July 18 -- It is pleasant to remember that Mr. W.J. Stillman lived to read the flattering notices which his autobiography received from nearly all the papers. He had written a number of books, some of which, like his ""Life of Crispi"" and his ""History of the Union of Italy,"" are of great and permanent value, but he had never until his autobiography was published attained any real success in literature."

1901-08-03T00:00:00Z,Within the past few months we have had a good many different judicial rulings touching the vexed question of what constitutes contempt of court. It would seem as if the judicial dignity was becoming more sensitive or that the judicial purview of the right of a court to demand respectful consideration was growing wider.

Although these plans must pass the perilous ""scrutiny of the higher officers of the company,"" it is pleasant to consider them and indulge in the possibly not illusory hope that they may sometime be adopted."
1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"FROM the days when Perseus donned the ""talaria,"" or winged anklets of Mercury, as he set out to conquer the Gorgons, and on his return delivered the beautiful Andromeda from the power of the sea monster sent out by Neptune to ravage the coasts of King Cepheus's dominions, the early history of the garter has never seen light."

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,The most incendiary declaration yet made in connection with the steel strike is the disclaimer of Mr. SHAFFER of responsibility for consequences if the strikers resort to violence. It is all the worse because couched in language affecting concern for the evils which must inevitably result from any breach of the peace.
1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"TO some the Summer of the plains is a monotonous succession of blue sky and fierce south winds. That is because they do not realize all that Summer means to the dweller in the new lands. Or it is because it is the viewpoint of the onlooker, and not of the participant. The true plainsman does not complain of the Summer heat or of the south winds."
1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"Business in the outside market yesterday was on a smaller scale than on the last two or three days, but the total was larger than those of other recent Saturdays.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"There are only two periods in the history of the money metals that can be compared to the present, and to which we may look for any experimental light upon the subject. One of these was the period following the discovery of America and the exploitation of the treasures of Mexico and Peru, and the other the period following the discoveries in California and Australia."

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"BERLIN, Aug. 17. -- Immediately after the funeral of the Dowager Empress Frederick a chorus of criticism of Count von Waldersee broke out in the press. Papers of the most different shades of opinion are weary of von Waldersee's talkativeness, which is regarded as not only in bad taste, in the allusion to other nations whose ""names paled in China,"" but also as magnifying the China campaign far beyond its actual importance."

Our coming house, however, will have no lamps, and, as for the boots, really intelligent people will feel the essential ugliness of wearing the evidence of constant manual toil upon their persons. They will wear sorts of shoes and boots that can be cleaned by wiping in a minute or so."
1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"GANANOQUE, Ontario, Aug. 17. -- With the arrival of the racing crews of the Toronto Canoe Club with their big war canoe to-day, and a number of other racing men who are expected to-morrow, matters will probably liven up at the camp of the American Canoe Association, on Mudlunta Island."

To hear one of these men explain his science, however, it all appears exceptionally simple."

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"It is impossible under ordinary conditions to write to any foreign country and inclose a stamp for a reply. A man may have a foreign stamp or two which he may send to his foreign correspondent, but he cannot supply such needs in any convenient manner.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor of The New York Times: Some of the clergymen of this city have been criticised because they take a vacation. Let us be fair. If they take two months during the Summer, it is but a few days more than fifty-two, which but makes up to them for the Sundays of the year, which are never days of rest to them, as they are to most men."

Dunning of Goshen, ex-Chief Clerk of the New York State Senate, has a fine collection of mounted specimens of birds, and among them is one of a bird that is to-day extinct, so far as any one has been able to discover, although less than fifteen years ago it was abundant on this continent and to the people of this State was as familiar as sparrows now are."

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"AUGUST is the month of highest mortality among city children. The heat gradually weakens the delicate infantile constitutions, and toward the end of August, sometimes even at the beginning of September, the death record of the little victims reaches its maximum.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,THERE is a study of humanity at the steamship piers on steamer day that is peculiar to the outgoing or the incoming of the vessels. There are so many ships plying on the ocean ferries and so many people coming and going that the crowds at the docks make up part of an animated scene of which the ship is but a part and which almost invests the ship with a personality.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,To the Editor of The New York Times: In your issue of to-day you bestow some deserved criticism upon The Toronto Mail and Empire's foolish claim that Americans do not like Rudyard Kipling's recent writings because he brought a lawsuit against an American publisher and has also been an ardent advocate of the Boer war.
1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"BAR HARBOR, Aug. 17. -- The season is rapidly approaching its height, and with the horse show the limit will be reached.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"There cannot be much dispute, we think, in view of recent events, that the Right Hon. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN, M.P., has done the British Empire more harm than any other man who was born into it during the nineteenth century.

1901-08-18T00:00:00Z,"The kinkajou is certainly interesting, and, when in good humor, very lovable, but, having enjoyed an intimate acquaintance with one, I cannot recommend it as a pet for the ordinary mortal.
