2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"FISHER--Naomi. A dear, dear friend who will be forever missed by everyone whose life she touched. Deepest sympathies to her family."
2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Along with jazz and speakeasies, the 1920s were also the heyday of the American carousel. A prime example, restored to its jazz-era glory, now sits on the Brooklyn waterfront. Jane's Carousel (named for Jane Walentas, the artist who rescued and restored it) was built in 1922 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company and installed in a park. Walentas -- whose husband, David, is largely responsible for the gentrification around the Manhattan Bridge -- found it at an auction in 1984 and spent 27 years bringing it back to life. Even as fancy carousels go, Jane's is especially elaborate, with hand-carved horses and detail work in platinum and gold leaf. The architect Jean Nouvel designed the acrylic box that shields riders from the elements and admits sunshine, creating a winter-garden effect when it's cold, with views of the bridges, Manhattan and the traffic on the water. ''What's exciting is to be right on the river, to have the tugboats and ferries going by,'' Walentas says. ''There's a playfulness about the whole thing.'' Number of horses: 48"
2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"See a larger version of the forest from this week. Compare with the enlarged version of last week's image. A thin layer of clouds filters the sunlight, which casts a muted haze on the forest. The sky is dove gray, the air crisp like a tart apple. This week we expected change, and on Monday morning we were not disappointed."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"IN honor of Miami Art Basel, which opens next weekend, the Christian Dior label asked the Berlin artist Anselm Reyle to design a collection of colorful accessories. Of his collaboration with the Avenue Montaigne fashion house, Mr. Reyle notes, ''As an artist, I have a fascination with dubious taste, so collaborating with Dior, a symbol of 'good' taste, was exciting.'' He didn't turn the house on its head, so much as on its side. The neon stitching on Dior's quilted cannage bag has been tilted to reflect the artist's fiddling with tradition. The limited-edition flats, totes and jewelry will be available at a Dior pop-up shop in Miami from Monday to Dec. 10, and then in select Dior boutiques come January. They might be camo, but don't expect to blend in. LILY MIESMER"

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"An article in some editions last Sunday about the Harvard football team's 45-7 victory over Yale described incorrectly the events at halftime after the public-address announcer asked for a moment of silence for the victims of an accident outside the Yale Bowl before the game. Yale's band did indeed perform at halftime (as did Harvard's); the band did not remain quiet for the remainder of halftime. The article also misidentified the team that Harvard defeated the previous week to clinch the Ivy League title. It was Penn, not Princeton."

2011-11-27T00:00:00Z,"ON Nov. 13, the celebrated modernist designer Eva Zeisel turned 105. She marked the occasion by publishing ''Prison Memoir,'' which details the 16 months she spent in a Soviet prison in the 1930s, during which time she tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrists with a copper wire pulled from a toilet. The Hungarian-born designer had been falsely accused of plotting to kill Stalin. She describes her Leningrad prison cell rather cheerily as ''a cupboard.'' ''I started to do gymnastics,'' she writes in the memoir, published this month in the literary journal A Public Space. ''I tried to stand on my head. This was rather easy in the cupboard because there is not too much room to fall.'' Brigid Hughes, the founding editor of A Public Space, visited Ms. Zeisel at her home in Rockland County earlier this year to work on editing. ''She's very, very sharp,'' said Ms. Hughes, who noted that even though Ms. Zeisel's vision and hearing were fading, she was still at work on new designs, including a little ceramic egg holder.

2011-11-28T15:15:24Z,"For a period of time in the early 1960s, a young commercial photographer named William John Kennedy made a habit of shooting a couple of artists he had befriended in New York's gallery scene. He then filed the negatives away in a cardboard box, where they remained for almost 50 years. Now 81 and living in Miami Beach, Kennedy recently unearthed the archive: the artists were Robert Indiana and Andy Warhol, and the period was late 1962 to 1964, the years during which Indiana and Warhol were becoming household names. The photographs, which will be exhibited at the Scope Miami art show during Art Basel Miami Beach, include some of the only known shots of Indiana and Warhol with their iconic works: Indiana with his ""Love"" painting, Warhol with an acetate of Marilyn Monroe. Perhaps more remarkably, though, they capture the artists not fully formed but on the cusp of fame. ""They were in their infancy,"" Kennedy said by phone from Miami. ""But by the end, it would be a miracle if I could shoot one minute because Andy was constantly going to the telephone to answer calls."""

Those words were not from this month's ''60 Minutes'' report raising questions about the Wall Street dealings of top lawmakers, or a new book exploring the same issue.

The movie was nominated for six Academy Awards and won for makeup and original score. Salma Hayek, below, nominated for best actress for her portrayal of Kahlo, has said she pursued the role for eight years. Alfred Molina channels Kahlo's husband, Diego Rivera. ''Ms. Taymor's film, adapted by no fewer than four screenwriters from Hayden Herrera's biography, is as restless and determined as its subject, whose painful, promiscuous life has become, almost 50 years after her death, something of a pop-culture legend,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''But while Kahlo, at least in the account favored by Ms. Herrera and Ms. Taymor, refused to be constrained by her sex, social convention or disability, 'Frida' is corseted by the norms of high-toned, responsible filmmaking, ticking off important events in Kahlo's life without much insight or feeling.'' But, he added, ''when the movie manages to break free -- in bursts of color, imagination, music, sex and over-the-top theatricality -- it honors the artist's brave, anarchic spirit.'' 10:30 A.M.

Right over there: a Nobel-prize-winning economist!) In this humbling company, on this intimidating matter, who am I to tell anyone what to think? And so my plan was, frankly, to avoid the subject. But while there are things a columnist can ignore (if Kim Kardashian ever features in this column, just shoot me), our failing economic ecosystem is not one of them. So for the past several weeks my airplane and bedside reading has consisted of sexy documents like ''A Roadmap for America's Future'' and ''The Way Forward'' and ''The Moment of Truth'' and ''Restoring America's Future'' and ''Living Within Our Means and Investing in the Future.'' I've also reached out to a few economists respected for the integrity of their science and their patience with economic illiterates."
2011-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Earlier this week we published an article about Google Apps, and Google's struggle to displace Microsoft Office and Sharepoint inside large corporations. While Google has worked without a large consulting partner, it should be said that several smaller consultancies are working to encourage companies to adopt Google's cloud-based office productivity software. Among these are Dito, SADA Systems, Appirio and Cloud Sherpas. Each offers a somewhat different approach. SADA is reselling both Microsoft and Google products. Appirio offers Google along with a broad range of other cloud services for business, like Salesforce.com. Dito is making much of moving companies to Google's Chromebooks, which are lightweight laptops built for cloud interactions. Cloud Sherpas is among the largest consultants stressing Apps, and it claims to have moved over 1 million people to Google Apps."

2011-11-28T00:00:00Z,"LOS ANGELES -- Despite much learned talk about the game-changing scientific discoveries in radioactivity it portrays, ''Radiance,'' a new drama by Alan Alda at the Geffen Playhouse here, doesn't emit much in the way of theatrical light. Certainly Mr. Alda, the amiable actor and besotted science buff, does his studious best to illuminate the challenges that Marie Curie, gracefully portrayed by Anna Gunn, faced in pursuing a career in the sciences at a time when it was virtually unheard of for women to take prominent roles in academic or public life. But his dramatization of Curie's personal and professional trials often feels like a talking diorama in a science museum, at least until it makes a sudden leap into juicy, gaslit melodrama in the second act."

2011-11-28T00:00:00Z,"On Friday, after shoppers had battled one another for bargains that might not have existed, balletgoers of many ages gathered at the David H. Koch Theater for a more reliable holiday ritual. As New York City Ballet's ''Nutcracker'' began its annual run of performances there, the tree telescoped on cue, the seven-headed Mouse King was vanquished, snowflakes swirled, and flowers waltzed. The Christmas magic in George Balanchine's imperishable staging, as in Tchaikovsky's score, is built in, guaranteed. Balanchine's inclusion of real children helps to guarantee it. Students from the School of American Ballet are always impeccably rehearsed. The comic details of child behavior in the party scene call for minimal acting, and a strong performance, like that of the gallant Colby Clark as Herr Drosselmeier's nephew, can make a difference. But the seriousness with which all of the children approach their dancing, their mimicry of adult civility, isn't acting. The drama underlying the ballet's fantasy and shifts of scale is really happening: the passing on of tradition. As it was for Balanchine as a child in St. Petersburg, Russia."

Born in Brooklyn, Herb, graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, where he played piccolo in the marching band, and then from NYU Law School. He later joined his father's business building homes and apartment buildings in Rockville Centre and Hewlett Harbor. He was appointed redeveloper as a partner of the firm of Stackler, Frank and Gold to build and complete the Urban Renewal Program for the Village of Rockville Centre, New York, and other projects on Long Island. In 1941 he met Rita Weinstein and when he asked which street he should take to drive her home, she told him to take the long way, and they did: He was married to Rita for 67 years before her passing in 2008. Together, they raised their beautiful son Richard, who sadly passed at the age of 35. Herb was a generous benefactor to countless organizations and individuals throughout the world. He established the Rita Gold Early Childhood Centers at Columbia University's Teachers College and in Tel Aviv. Herb funded many scholarships for young Opera singers, as well as for underprivileged students making it possible for them to go on to higher education. He was also a generous donor to The New York City Opera, Julliard, and The Sarasota Opera. Herb lived life to the fullest, inspiring those around him to strive to fulfill their highest potential. He was a kind, soft-spoken man of keen intellect and quick wit. Herb was a philanthropist and active participant in Jewish causes in the US and Israel, and a caring and generous friend to so many. He has left all of us an extraordinary legacy of learning and commitment to service. He will always be in our hearts. He is survived by his brother Ronny and loving cousins in America and Israel.

Old, who was internationally recognized as one of the founders and standard bearers of the field of tumor immunology. His research over a period of more than 50 years has directly enabled the design and development of tumor-specific vaccines and targeted antibodies. He was dedicated to developing the field of immunology and was a devoted and selfless mentor to hundreds of young researchers. His vision and leadership brought basic and clinical investigators together, across institutional and international borders, to take tumor immunology from animal models into clinical research and the development of promising new cancer therapies. Dr. Old joined MSKCC in 1958, served as associate director of research from 1973 to 1983, and was named to the William E. Snee Chair in Cancer Immunology in 1983. In June 2011 he received the C. Chester Stock Award from MSKCC. Dr. Lloyd also served for 17 years as Director of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and for 30 years as Scientific Director of the Cancer Research Institute. He will be sorely missed by all his colleagues. We extend our sympathies to his family. Craig B. Thompson, MD President, Robert E. Wittes, MD Physician-in-Chief, Thomas J.

For the research, investigators tallied the results of dozens of studies about the effects of exercise on the so-called fat gene, which is believed to increase the risk that carriers will be overweight or obese by 12 percent or more. Scientists first identified this gene, called the ''fat mass and obesity-associated'' gene, or FTO gene, several years ago, and as it turns out, it's distressingly common. By most estimates, about 65 percent of people of European or African descent and perhaps 44 percent of Asians carry some version of the FTO gene."

2011-11-29T00:00:00Z,"The playwright Tony Kushner, below, has been named the recipient of a $100,000 award honoring artists and others for ''socially responsible work'' and challenges to authority, like Mr. Kushner's fight with City University of New York trustees last spring over an honorary degree that they temporarily withheld from him. The Puffin Foundation and the Nation Institute, a nonprofit media center with ties to The Nation, the left-leaning magazine, announced on Monday that Mr. Kushner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''Angels in America'' and other plays, would receive the annual Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship. The award citation credited Mr. Kushner's ''lifetime of artistic work and activism,'' but did not mention the CUNY furor explicitly. But Andy Breslau, president of the Nation Institute, said that ''Tony's refusal to submit to the mischaracterization of his statements on Israel at a moment of great public controversy struck the jury as not only commendable but also in keeping with his career-long commitment to the public responsibilities of the artist.'' CUNY trustees voted in May to shelve an honorary degree that one of its campuses, John Jay College, planned to award to Mr. Kushner after a CUNY trustee said Mr. Kushner had disparaged Israel in past comments, a characterization Mr. Kushner immediately denounced as slander. The executive committee of the board later reversed the decision. In a statement Mr. Kushner said, ''I was surprised -- shocked, even -- that I've been chosen to be the recipient of this year's Puffin/Nation Prize.'' Previous recipients include Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the human-rights activist Michael Ratner."

2011-11-29T00:00:00Z,"Long-lost works by Walt Disney, below, are suddenly sprouting like the bits of a chopped-up broom brought magically to life. An early cartoon drawing by Disney, dating from the early 1920s before Mickey Mouse was a gleam in his eye, will be among the items for sale at a two-day auction in Reno, Nev., The Associated Press reported. The drawing, titled ''Fill Up My Can,'' depicts a cigar-smoking man in a derby hat and bears the prophetic if not rib-tickling caption, ''Develop your sense of humor and it will develop you.'' (Fans will also notice that Disney's autograph hasn't quite developed its signature flourish.) The drawing was owned by Disney's sister, Ruth, and is expected to sell for $35,000 to $50,000 at an auction that starts Tuesday at the Atlantic Casino Resort. On the other side of the Atlantic, an independent British film library says it has found one of the earliest animated shorts to feature Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a Mickey-like prototype created by Disney and Ub Iwerks before the more famous mouse came to prominence. Reuters reported that an Oswald cartoon called ''Hungry Hobos'' was found in the collection of the Huntley Film Archives, which is cataloging 80,000 items in its inventory. The short is expected to sell for $30,000 to $40,000 at a Bonhams auction on Dec. 14 in Los Angeles."

Pocket-friendly, modest, undictatorial, with a bright but quiet voice, it touches on multiple aspects of ballet (music, drama, ballet classicism, spatial architecture and more), engaging readers in a manner so unassuming that they are effortlessly involved in critical thought by way of friendly conversation. Although I have never spoken with Ms. Goldner extensively, in her book she is a true companion: her writing leads us into her temperament and, often enough, her life."

Though perhaps ""debates"" is too high-minded a word, since the most prominent argument has featured Pankaj Mishra accusing Ferguson (in a vituperous London Review of Books review) of being a neo-imperialist, ""white's man burden""-toting Euro-chauvinist, followed by Ferguson threatening to sue Mishra for libel.

He's objecting to the idea, raised by Ferguson's book and emphasized by Donald Kagan's Times review, that European colonialists did good as well as evil, and that the Western imperialist project has to be credited with positive legacies as well as with grave crimes. Here's Delong's retort:"

""Church"" is a burnt red alternative to Wicked (a popular Essie shade), and Reade, a metallic charcoal, was named for the salon's home base. With its five-free formula (no formaldehyde resin, camphor, formaldehyde, toluene or dibutyl phthalate) and easy-to-hold brush (the salon's technicians work from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., so a little attention to ergonomic detail was in order), this new polish deserves a big hand."

Like any good activist, Norquist is a monomaniac about his issue: Everything in American politics revolves around taxes, all good things flow from tax cuts, no deal that increases taxes can ever benefit America, etc. etc. As I said at AEI, I think this view is mistaken, and that focusing obsessively on tax rates has proven to be an insufficient and even counterproductive strategy for actually limiting the size and scope of government. (Steven Hayward elaborates a bit on this argument in his recent essay on conservatism's intellectual blind spots.) And worse, because taxpayers are liable for tomorrow's debts as well as today's tax rates, even the pledge's present success at keeping rates relatively low may look like a pyrrhic victory in the long run."

Founder of Lighting Services Inc, whose company's products illuminate museums and display windows all over the world, died November 29, 2011, in Westport, CT, of complications from cancer. He was 84. A longtime Westport, CT resident, Mr. Gelman had a passion for boating and being on the water. He was a member of the Saugatuck River Sail and Power Squadron and former Commander of Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 72 based in Norwalk, CT. Mr. Gelman was a member of the NY Section of the Illuminating Engineering Society (IESNY) since 1950. He began his career as the Lighting Director of NBC's Tonight Show with Steve Allen. While working at NBC, he met his future wife, Barbara Savini, a production assistant with the program. The two married in 1957. In 1958, he left the network to launch his own consulting firm Lighting Services Inc (LSI) which had a motto of ""everything in lighting from design to installation"". Within a few years, realizing that quality lighting equipment was not available in the field, Mr. Gelman changed focus and Lighting Services Inc became a full-fledged specialty manufacturer of accent and display lighting. Mr. Gelman told friends, ""From day one we decided we wanted to be the best in the business."" When Mr. Gelman walked into a room, the first thing he did was look up at the lights. His passion for lighting ran deep. He thrived in his role as an entrepreneur and innovator in his field, introducing the world to track, accent, and display lighting. Mr. Gelman enjoyed describing the start of LSI, ""I started the company with $400"". In the early years of Lighting Services Inc, Mr. Gelman's Accountant called him up and said, ""Marv, you're not really making any money here, maybe you ought to ""bag-it."" Astonished at what the Accountant said, ""Bag-It what? I refused to ""bag-it"", this is what I wanted to do --- Lighting. So I changed Accountants, I ""bagged"" them."" He often said, ""You have to do what you like, otherwise you waste your whole life."" Installations at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Hong Kong Museum of History and Walt Disney Theme Parks are among those lighted with LSI's fixtures, as are display windows at Tiffany's, Gucci, Bergdorf Goodman and other luxury retailers. Born March 27, 1927, in New York, Marvin was the son of the late Jack and Lena Gelman. During World War II, he received training in electrical engineering while serving in the US Navy. After graduating from New York University, he began graduate studies in stage design and lighting at Columbia University. As a husband, father, and grandfather he was generous and loving. The family enjoyed many years of happiness, laughter and traveling together. Mr. Gelman was predeceased by his wife, Barbara Savini Gelman, who died in 1997. He retired from Lighting Services Inc in 2000 after 42 years as founder and President. He is survived by his daughter, Gretchen Saccone of Monroe, CT; son and daughter-in-law, Daniel and Ellyn Gelman of Westport; his five grandchildren, Chris and Corey Saccone of Monroe and Keith, Dayna, and Craig Gelman of Westport. He is also survived by his sister Rene Gelman MD, of Brookline, MA. Memorial contributions may be made to the Education Trust at the International Association of Lighting Designers. http://www.iald.org/trust/ donatehome.asp IALD Education Trust The Merchandise Mart, Suite 9-104, 200 World Trade Center Chicago, IL 60654."

2011-11-30T00:00:00Z,"OLD--Lloyd, J. The Cancer Research Institute (CRI) grieves the passing of its founding scientific and medical director, Lloyd J. Old, M.D., the Father of Modern Tumor Immunology, who died from prostate cancer Monday morning at age 78. Lloyd was a pioneer with a distinguished scientific career, whose passionate belief that the immune system could be harnessed to control and eventually cure cancer inspired generations of tumor immunologists. From his numerous seminal contributions to our understanding of the immune system and its relationship to cancer, through forty years as director of CRI's scientific programs, to his visionary leadership in bringing together CRI and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR) to form the CRI/LICR Cancer Vaccine Collaborative, a jointly directed global clinical trials network established in 2001 to accelerate development of therapeutic cancer vaccines, Dr. Old transformed the fields of immunology and tumor immunology and made possible many of today's advances in immune system-based treatment of cancer. Although his imprint on the Cancer Research Institute and on the future of cancer treatment is strong, and his legacy of vision and leadership lives on through our work and the work of thousands of scientists who have been touched by Dr. Old's scholarship, generosity, and support, we nevertheless will feel deeply the absence of this caring, considerate, and highly intelligent man for whom we have the profoundest respect and admiration. Our condolences go to Dr. Old's sister, Constance, nephews, Christopher and Albert, niece, Letitia, and to his closest colleagues and many friends.

Murphy, and extend sympathy to his beloved and bereaved family. Over the last 44 years, Mr. Murphy devoted his time, spirit and energy to AHRC New York City and NYSARC Inc. A past president of the New York City Chapter, Jim held various Board Officer positions over the years, and served on and chaired several Board Committees.

At the NYSARC State level, Jim was a member of the Board of Governors for several years, and was a member of NYSARC's Legal Committee. He was a parent advocate who spoke from the heart as only a parent can. But he also spoke with reason and logic, and as a gentleman was able to influence politicians and professionals in the field of developmental and intellectual disabilities, making him a figure that was well respected by Governors, legislators and government officials. In addition to his involvement with AHRC New York City, Jim was a retired Executive Vice President and Director of Public Policy of Fleet Financial Group. From 1980 to 1997 he was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York. He was Vice President of the American Irish Historical Society and Chairman of the advisory board of the CUNY Institute for Irish-American Studies at Lehman College. He served on the Board of Trustees of Mount Sinai Medical School and LaSalle Academy in Manhattan. In 2001, Jim was a recipient of the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Education Association for service to public and non-public education. Jim is survived by his wife, Marge, and children Cathy, Patricia, Christopher, James, Matthew and Michael, and grandchildren. His son, Michael resides in an AHRC group residence. Jim will be remembered by his ""AHRC family"" for giving of himself for over forty years and will be greatly missed.

Old, M.D., the Father of Modern Tumor Immunology, who died from prostate cancer Monday morning at age 78. Lloyd was a pioneer with a distinguished scientific career, whose passionate belief that the immune system could be harnessed to control and eventually cure cancer inspired generations of tumor immunologists. From his numerous seminal contributions to our understanding of the immune system and its relationship to cancer, through forty years as director of CRI's scientific programs, to his visionary leadership in bringing together CRI and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR) to form the CRI/LICR Cancer Vaccine Collaborative, a jointly directed global clinical trials network established in 2001 to accelerate development of therapeutic cancer vaccines, Dr. Old transformed the fields of immunology and tumor immunology and made possible many of today's advances in immune system-based treatment of cancer. Although his imprint on the Cancer Research Institute and on the future of cancer treatment is strong, and his legacy of vision and leadership lives on through our work and the work of thousands of scientists who have been touched by Dr. Old's scholarship, generosity, and support, we nevertheless will feel deeply the absence of this caring, considerate, and highly intelligent man for whom we have the profoundest respect and admiration. Our condolences go to Dr. Old's sister, Constance, nephews, Christopher and Albert, niece, Letitia, and to his closest colleagues and many friends.

And a good pension in the precarious world of the arts is one element that helps keep players ensconced in their chairs, ensuring that handoff of artistic heritage. The storied Philadelphia Orchestra had one of the better pension plans around. But now the orchestra, burdened by tens of millions of dollars in pension obligations it says it cannot afford, is using bankruptcy court to avoid paying for them."

That leads to dinner, followed by bullets and boat chases on the canals of Venice. ''Stargazing is the only reason bonbons like 'The Tourist' are made, dreams of box office bonanzas aside,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Still, there's definitely some amusement in watching Ms. Jolie's character come to the rescue of Mr. Depp's, ''a role reversal the movie only flirts with,'' Ms. Dargis added. ''But oh how much more fun it would have been if Mr. Depp had really played the girl, eyeliner and all.''"

Here is a sampling of those comments, as submitted to nytimes.com/fashion. We ended up giving the kids my last name (I'm the mother) because my extended family is much smaller than my husband's, with far fewer offspring to carry on the name. It came down to throwing out ''tradition'' as the default and instead considering how we can support both heritages in the long term (i.e., which surname needed the help to survive). I hope that one day this won't seem so radical to people -- that surnames will be considered rather than assumed."

The Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors has also complained to the theater, TheaterWorks, noting that the production had casting calls in New York City, a training ground for many Hispanic actors. Mr. Guirgis, who had been discussing his concerns with the play's director, Tazewell Thompson, and executives at TheaterWorks over the last two weeks, said in an interview that he decided to make his concerns public because the TheaterWorks executives ''are in a position of accountability and yet refuse to take responsibility for mistakes in the casting.'' The production is scheduled to end on Sunday, but Mr. Guirgis decided it was still worth speaking up because he hoped other theaters would make the effort to cast Hispanic actors, when available, in the two lead roles."

Founder of Lighting Services Inc, whose company's products illuminate museums and display windows all over the world, died November 29, 2011, in Westport, CT, of complications from cancer. He was 84. A longtime Westport, CT resident, Mr. Gelman had a passion for boating and being on the water. He was a member of the Saugatuck River Sail and Power Squadron and former Commander of Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 72 based in Norwalk, CT. Mr. Gelman was a member of the NY Section of the Illuminating Engineering Society (IESNY) since 1950. He began his career as the Lighting Director of NBC's Tonight Show with Steve Allen. While working at NBC, he met his future wife, Barbara Savini, a production assistant with the program. The two married in 1957. In 1958, he left the network to launch his own consulting firm Lighting Services Inc (LSI) which had a motto of ""everything in lighting from design to installation"". Within a few years, realizing that quality lighting equipment was not available in the field, Mr. Gelman changed focus and Lighting Services Inc became a full-fledged specialty manufacturer of accent and display lighting. Mr. Gelman told friends, ""From day one we decided we wanted to be the best in the business."" When Mr. Gelman walked into a room, the first thing he did was look up at the lights. His passion for lighting ran deep. He thrived in his role as an entrepreneur and innovator in his field, introducing the world to track, accent, and display lighting. Mr. Gelman enjoyed describing the start of LSI, ""I started the company with $400"". In the early years of Lighting Services Inc, Mr. Gelman's Accountant called him up and said, ""Marv, you're not really making any money here, maybe you ought to ""bag-it."" Astonished at what the Accountant said, ""Bag-It what? I refused to ""bag-it"", this is what I wanted to do --- Lighting. So I changed Accountants, I ""bagged"" them."" He often said, ""You have to do what you like, otherwise you waste your whole life."" Installations at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Hong Kong Museum of History and Walt Disney Theme Parks are among those lighted with LSI's fixtures, as are display windows at Tiffany's, Gucci, Bergdorf Goodman and other luxury retailers. Born March 27, 1927, in New York, Marvin was the son of the late Jack and Lena Gelman. During World War II, he received training in electrical engineering while serving in the US Navy. After graduating from New York University, he began graduate studies in stage design and lighting at Columbia University. As a husband, father, and grandfather he was generous and loving. The family enjoyed many years of happiness, laughter and traveling together. Mr. Gelman was predeceased by his wife, Barbara Savini Gelman, who died in 1997. He retired from Lighting Services Inc in 2000 after 42 years as founder and President. He is survived by his daughter, Gretchen Saccone of Monroe, CT; son and daughter-in-law, Daniel and Ellyn Gelman of Westport; his five grandchildren, Chris and Corey Saccone of Monroe and Keith, Dayna, and Craig Gelman of Westport.

To my mind, if a given puzzle met or exceeded the amount of fun I personally have when I do one of David Quarfoot's puzzles, that extra fun could then be measured, like an index, in a relative number of Quarfeet. The greater the number of Quarfeet, the greater the solving fun. I realize that this measurement would have to be entirely subjective, and that that might strike some of you as unfair, but as a general policy, I'd have to say I really don't have any trouble with that. I like Mr. Quarfoot's puzzles, and it's entirely possible that I'm just losing my mind."

In the 19th century, presidents summarized progress at the end of the year rather than the beginning, which gives a little more perspective on things. The phrase ""the State of the Union"" dates from 1934, when Franklin D. Roosevelt used it for the first time. Nor was it spoken, as it has been, generally, since Woodrow Wilson chose to travel down Pennsylvania Avenue and deliver his message verbally in 1913. (Jimmy Carter sent his in in 1981, a confession that things had not gone so well.) Instead, Lincoln composed a long written document, and sent it to Congress."

As a first-time Bloomingdale's visitor, I must admit that the prospect of putting together a selection of seasonally appropriate outfits was daunting; back home in New Zealand, the largest department store is about a quarter of the size of the men's-wear section alone. The hurdles are self-evident: too many options, too much running around between the designers' in-shop shops, a plethora of mediums and larges but few smalls (petite men must buy more clothes, or something). On the flip side, the staff is attentive, the merchandising is worthy of a Milanese boutique's window, and the brands are spectacular. You'll find Polo Ralph Lauren sitting alongside Z Zegna, Salvatore Ferragamo and Ovadia & Sons.

Then unwrap the logs and use a sharp knife to slice off 3/16-inch-thick rounds of the dough. Bake as directed for in the recipe, then form sandwich cookies with the marmalade filling. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Just as tasty, much quicker. You could even skip the marmalade. But I wouldn't."

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"President announced Thursday that he was seeking additional federal money for efforts to prevent and treat AIDS in the United States and globally. In an address to activists, celebrities and lawmakers for the annual World AIDS Day, Mr. Obama said that he would seek $15 million more to support H.I.V. clinics in the United States and $35 million for state drug programs. For international efforts, he set a goal of nearly doubling, to six million, the number of infected people who will get antiretroviral AIDS drugs through a program that his predecessor, George W. Bush, started. Advocacy groups say contributions have suffered as perceptions have taken hold that the epidemic has been arrested. Mr. Obama acknowledged that while the rate of infection has declined elsewhere, in the United States it has remained steady. ''The president just put a powerful down payment toward the end of the AIDS crisis,'' Matthew Kavanagh, director of advocacy for Health GAP, an activist group, said in a statement. And the international group Doctors Without Borders hailed Mr. Obama's financing commitment as ''the shot in the arm that the global H.I.V./AIDS response needs right now,'' and called on Congress ''to turn this commitment into reality.''"

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Charles D. Avery Dennison Corp. mourns the passing of Charles D. ""Chuck"" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. In 1998, he received the Heritage Award in recognition of his outstanding service to Johns Hopkins. He also had a long association with Occidental College, serving as a trustee from 1977 to 1998 and continuing thereafter as a trustee emeritus. He remained an active businessman, civic leader and philanthropist after retiring from Avery Dennison. He invested in real estate and owned and operated a wine company, the noted Jackson Hole restaurant Koshu, and a highly successful stable of thoroughbred horses. At the time of his death, he was a member of the executive board of the Rose Bowl Legacy Campaign for the renovation and preservation of the Rose Bowl, a member of the advisory board of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage and a trustee of Southern California Public Radio. The company expresses its deepest condolences to his wife, Carolyn; his daughters Amanda Daly Miller, Candice Louise Miller, Katherine Ann Miller, Susie Cherrill Otten and Charlotte Juanita Miller; and his grandchildren Laura, David, Eric and John Otten, and Harper, Juliet and Zander Branch. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service is planned for December 12 at 11am at The Langham Huntington, 1401 South Oak Knoll Avenue, Pasadena, and a memorial website: CharlesDMiller.org, is now live. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory can be made to: Charles D. Miller Legacy Fund United Way of Greater Los Angeles, 1150 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, California 90015.

We're not going to balance the budget just by pretending that all they have to do is take out the waste. We're going to have to cut spending. And I'm in favor of cutting spending, capping federal spending as a percentage of G.D.P. at 20 percent or less, and having a balanced budget amendment. The right answer for America is to stop the growth of the federal government, and to start the growth of the private sector. I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.''"

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"YANNETT--Walter M. 82, principal of Syosset High School for fifteen years, passed away peacefully at home on November 27, 2011. Dr. Yannett served as Syosset High School principal from 1970 to 1985. He also was principal of Division Avenue High School in Levittown from 1965 to 1970. He held various positions at high schools in Bethpage, Baldwin and Floral Park, before becoming principal of Division Avenue. He taught for many years as an adjunct professor in the schools of education at St. John's University and Hofstra University. In 1986, he became an assistant dean in the School of Education at Hofstra. Born in 1929, Dr. Yannett was a long-time resident of Seaford. He received his B.S. degree in secondary education, magna cum laude, from Fordham University in 1951. He served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1954 and then began his career in education upon returning from being stationed in Okinawa, Japan. In 1964, he earned a PhD in counselor education from St. John's University. In his early years, he played drums in a small jazz band. His lifelong love of music, especially jazz, made him a strong supporter of the arts in public schools. In 1983, the Nassau County Music Educators Association named him ""Administrator of the Year."" He also was an avid golfer, playing many rounds with friends and family. His other sport's endeavors spanned the athletic spectrum, from coaching young children's basketball teams to serving for over four decades on various committees of the Nassau County Public High School Athletic Association (Section VIII). Walter's warm smile and gentle soul are what drew people to him; from his colleagues to new acquaintances to his family. He was devoted to his three grandchildren, each of whom he showered with love. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Elizabeth, of Seaford; a brother, Frank and sister-in-law Marie, both of Newton, PA; a daughter, Nancy, and her partner Elise Brokaw, both of Lincoln, VT; and a son, Bruce, daughter-in-law Karen, and three beloved grandchildren, Elise, Gregory and Amanda, all of Rye, NY. He is also survived by several nieces and nephews. Walter was predeceased by his sister, Elaine Agnelli. A private ceremony and burial took place earlier this week.

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"How imperfect a pairing it seems: the silent, still, small-scale, black-and-white photograph and the sonorous, tumultuous, extravagant and kaleidoscopic opera. And yet, Times archival pictures from the 1940s through the early 1970s (most by Sam Falk) reveal how perfectly these two media complemented one another. Photographers may not have been able to capture the sweep of a production in a single exposure. But they could record up close the hundreds of interstitial moments that yielded the splendor on stage: principals rehearsing incongruously in street clothes, musicians scrambling to locate their instruments, a lead soprano waiting backstage for a cue, the chorus in metal folding chairs."

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"ROCKVILLE, Md. - Last week, when a former Boston Red Sox infielder faced accusations of insider trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission got credit for levying a $100,000 fine. The Department of Justice in May heralded a guilty plea from a one-time senior executive at the Nasdaq Stock Market who traded on secret information. And earlier this year, after a lawyer was accused of stealing insider tidbits, federal prosecutors in New Jersey boasted of the arrest. But in each case, the federal government was not the first to detect the potential fraud. Rather, the initial alarm bells were sounded by an obscure group of private-sector analysts stationed here in suburban Maryland."

2011-12-02T00:00:00Z,"''Storytelling in Japanese Art,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is a captivating combination of show and tell, read and look. Curatorially speaking, the exhibition takes us gently in hand and, through text panels, captions and diagrams, reveals the narrative side of Japanese art with memorable clarity. It has been organized by Masako Watanabe, a senior research associate in the Met's Asian art department, and while installed in the museum's Japanese permanent-collection galleries, it is a temporary show full of significant loans. Illuminating the tales played out in a lavish assortment of hand scrolls, hanging scrolls, screens and books, the exhibition, with its explications and elucidations, gives didacticism a good name. It deserves return visits, especially for its second rotation, starting Feb. 8, when, due to fragility, several hand scrolls will be wound to different scenes and five screens will be replaced by others."

Born in Toronto on March 17, 1924, he immersed himself in the study of art before and after serving in the Canadian Army. In 1944, a serendipitous encounter with legendary designer Tommi Parzinger at the Museum of Modern Art in New York forever changed both their lives. The two became partners in business as well as life, and together they created Parzinger Originals, a furniture and interior design firm that catered to elite decorators and clients. Their creations continue to inspire and entice savvy dealers and collectors to this day. Like Parzinger, Donald also created extraordinary pieces for the fashionable Madison Avenue retailer Rena Rosenthal. A bold and original abstract painter, he was invited by Hilla Rebay to exhibit at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, the precursor to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in the late 1940s. Following Mr. Parzinger's death in 1981, Donald established his own namesake firm to serve select clients eager to avail themselves of his encyclopedic knowledge of modern design. In addition to being one of the great under-sung maestros of 20th-century design himself, he was a gracious and elegant host and a fixture in his Beekman Place neighborhood, renowned for his wit, warmth and dapper personal style. His life was an object lesson in generosity and gracious living.

2011-12-03T00:00:00Z,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) Matt Damon, his toothy grin hinting at a young Robert F. Kennedy, portrays David Norris, a Democratic Brooklyn son and a favorite in the New York race for the United States Senate. That is, until a damaging photo from his past does in his campaign, and he meets Elise (Emily Blunt, above with Mr. Damon), a dancer who innocently causes him to veer off the path that a team of mystery men have, unbeknownst to David, plotted for him. Their plan does not include Emily, or free will on David's part, for that matter. Now he must decide whether to give in to their machinations -- or reclaim his life. If George Nolfi, who directed this film and wrote the screenplay, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, ''doesn't go deep in 'The Adjustment Bureau,' a drilling down to where it hurts (he would rather entertain than pain you), he skates on the gray-blue surfaces of his film with confidence,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Along with his likable, confidently sexy leads and an excellent troika'' in John Slattery, Anthony Mackie and Terence Stamp, ''Mr. Nolfi keeps the film balanced between sincerity and self-conscious amusement, rarely faltering in tone. With their cool-cat hats and tailored suits, Mr. Mackie, Mr. Slattery and Mr. Stamp look as if they're on hiatus from Mr. Slattery's AMC show, 'Mad Men' (or extras in 'North by Northwest'). Like Mr. Damon and Ms. Blunt they can bring you into this world because Mr. Nolfi never takes his eye off the human stakes.'' 6 P.M.

But now, after several months of restoration work long urged by experts, the paintings, ''Philip III on Horseback'' from 1634-35 and ''Margaret of Austria on Horseback,'' created during the same years, have returned to the company of Velazquez's royal portraits. -The restoration, sponsored by Fundacion Iberdrola and undertaken by Rocio Davila, has not only removed dirt and darkening varnish - which the museum said created a ''veil'' that obscured the sense of pictorial recession in the paintings - but also removed strips that had been added to the left and right side of both portraits in the mid-18th century to make them the same size as other works in a series that Velazquez had painted. The strips undermined Velazquez's composition and the pigments in the strips darkened differently than the those in the original paintings, creating an effect that looked almost as if a broad shaft of light was pouring down on the subjects."

""Chuck"" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. In 1998, he received the Heritage Award in recognition of his outstanding service to Johns Hopkins. He also had a long association with Occidental College, serving as a trustee from 1977 to 1998 and continuing thereafter as a trustee emeritus. He remained an active businessman, civic leader and philanthropist after retiring from Avery Dennison. He invested in real estate and owned and operated a wine company, the noted Jackson Hole restaurant Koshu, and a highly successful stable of thoroughbred horses. At the time of his death, he was a member of the executive board of the Rose Bowl Legacy Campaign for the renovation and preservation of the Rose Bowl, a member of the advisory board of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage and a trustee of Southern California Public Radio. The company expresses its deepest condolences to his wife, Carolyn; his daughters Amanda Daly Miller, Candice Louise Miller, Katherine Ann Miller, Susie Cherrill Otten and Charlotte Juanita Miller; and his grandchildren Laura, David, Eric and John Otten, and Harper, Juliet and Zander Branch.

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"YANNETT--Walter M. 82, principal of Syosset High School for fifteen years, passed away peacefully at home on November 27, 2011. Dr. Yannett served as Syosset High School principal from 1970 to 1985. He also was principal of Division Avenue High School in Levittown from 1965 to 1970. He held various positions at high schools in Bethpage, Baldwin and Floral Park, before becoming principal of Division Avenue. He taught for many years as an adjunct professor in the schools of education at St. John's University and Hofstra University. In 1986, he became an assistant dean in the School of Education at Hofstra. Born in 1929, Dr. Yannett was a long-time resident of Seaford. He received his B.S. degree in secondary education, magna cum laude, from Fordham University in 1951. He served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1954 and then began his career in education upon returning from being stationed in Okinawa, Japan. In 1964, he earned a PhD in counselor education from St. John's University. In his early years, he played drums in a small jazz band. His lifelong love of music, especially jazz, made him a strong supporter of the arts in public schools. In 1983, the Nassau County Music Educators Association named him ""Administrator of the Year."" He also was an avid golfer, playing many rounds with friends and family. His other sport's endeavors spanned the athletic spectrum, from coaching young children's basketball teams to serving for over four decades on various committees of the Nassau County Public High School Athletic Association (Section VIII). Walter's warm smile and gentle soul are what drew people to him; from his colleagues to new acquaintances to his family. He was devoted to his three grandchildren, each of whom he showered with love. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Elizabeth, of Seaford; a brother, Frank and sister-in-law Marie, both of Newton, PA; a daughter, Nancy, and her partner Elise Brokaw, both of Lincoln, VT; and a son, Bruce, daughter-in-law Karen, and three beloved grandchildren, Elise, Gregory and Amanda, all of Rye, NY. He is also survived by several nieces and nephews. Walter was predeceased by his sister, Elaine Agnelli. A private ceremony and burial took place earlier this week. Donations may be made to the Dr. Walter M. Yannett Memorial Fund, which will be used to provide an annual scholarship to a college-bound senior at Syosset High School. Donations should be made payable to Community Funds, Inc. and sent to New York Community Trust, 909 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022."

Stein lived in New York City most of her life. Preceded in death by mother Margaret Bruce Stein and father Benjamin F. Stein, M.D., of Sarasota, Fla. Survived by longtime companion Douglas Stein of New York City, sister Julia Long (Randy) of Weekie Wachee, Fla., and brother John F. Stein (Beth) of Nashville, TN, niece Kim Long and nephews Jonathan Long (Jaime) and Tyler Stein. Stein received a B.A. from Bard College with extensive PhD work at Rutgers University, where she taught literature and writing. She began her journalism career covering rock music for Circus, Creem and others before joining Omni magazine as a founding editor and writer. Former Omni editor and friend Keith Ferrell writes, Stein, during her long tenureat Omni, became one of the very best writers on science, and particularly neuroscience, in the country. Her stewardship of the magazine's legendary interviews is the prime reason they are legendary. She followed science with the assiduousness of a good reporter, and pursued its explication for general audiences with the enthusiasm of an evangelist. A widely published science and technology writer, Stein wrote for the New York Times, Biotechnology Newswatch and UPI, among others. Her book, The Genius Engine, on the complex role of the prefrontal cortex of the human brain was published in 2007. It received praise as a laudable work. A tremendous effort brought out with natural ease and Stein for her ability to present technical information in understandable terms, without being pedantic or overly simple. In addition to her love of writing, reading and good conversation, Stein was an avid hiker and accomplished sailor. There will be a memorial service at a later date. The family requests memorial donations be made to The Nature Conservancy, Bard College English Department or Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)."

Eventually I won't be able to swallow at all and will require a feeding tube. Everyone in my family is gone, so I had been totally alone in my illness. But then I met Danny at our assisted-living facility in May. He had just been transferred here from hospice, and the first time we looked into one another's eyes, our souls locked. I love Danny's quietness and his acceptance of the situation we are in. We decided to get married and vowed to take care of each other to the end. The facility director wanted to throw a party. She took me shopping -- we found a prom dress on sale -- and she did my makeup and hair. We married on July 2, 2011, and all of the residents came. Some even cried during the ceremony, and everyone danced afterward. It was the most beautiful day of my life. I'd been married before, but this was different. I realized, it does not matter when you meet the love of your life -- all that matters is that I got to meet him. Danny Clauson, 53: The very first moment I saw Michelle, I thought, I'm going to marry that woman. I was bowled over by her beauty. And then I fell in love with her spirit. Less than a month later, I asked her to spend the rest of my life with me. I've lived a hard life: I've been married before, but it did not end well. Since then, I've been homeless and am now dying from liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis C. I've suffered a lot and was ready to give up. But ever since I met Michelle, I wake up happy."

The on dit is that metropolitan hotels are now the favored working, socializing and culture-consuming loci of the mediatized professional. But hey, let's not just surf the zeitgeist. Let's hang 10 on the breaking wave of the future: hotels are what neophytes term ''glocal'' phenomena, in that they seamlessly elide down-home verities - a rumpus room for colleagues and pals - with worldwide utilities. However, no longer is it a case of ''All work and no play make Jack a dull boy. . . .'' - we're not talking about wintering over in the Rockies and trying a little ax play here, oh, no. Rather, the aim is to strike out for the known, check into a hotel in your own immediate environs, and then reorient your usual pursuits around this novel situation.

The elder son of Donald Deskey, innovative industrial designer, and Mary Campbell Douthett, pianist, Michael Deskey was born and raised in NYC, going to school first at Dalton and later at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. He was educated further at Yale and M.I.T., with a year of construction work between so that forever after he could talk to engineers and recognize subpar concrete testing. At Harrison & Abramovitz, Architects, in NYC from 1959, he designed laboratories for Brandeis University and New York State at Albany as well as the underground concourse and extension of Rockefeller Center west of Sixth Avenue and the U.N. International School in NYC. He also supervised the construction of the new McGraw-Hill building and the U.N. Library. In 1975 he grew a beard and soon after moved to Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, as the resident architect on the state medical college's education complex. Later he supervised additions to Southern Ocean County Hospital, Manahawkin, NJ, and the construction of headquarters for Philip Morris and Equitable Life Assurance, NYC, and managed the building of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers research facility in Hanover, NH. His last project was supervising the construction of the American Museum of the Moving Image in NYC. Mr. Deskey was a skilled amateur photographer and electronics wizard and a punster. He wrote for ""Films in Review"" and twice fooled the panel on ""To Tell the Truth."" He was articulate, erudite; a lover of cats, women, movies, animation, symphonic music, midcentury modern design, the Vignelli map, Manhattan, a good pot roast, language, Helvetica, the books of John P. Marquand, and crosswords. He had an encyclopedic mind and a dry wit; he was a stickler for detail and beloved for his eccentricity. His brother, D. Stephen Deskey, and his nephews, Derek and Dennis, survive him, as do his last cats, Chloe and Samantha. He is sorely missed by his friends."

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"8:30 P.M. (Cinemax) CEDAR RAPIDS (2011) The skyscrapers and his sparkling hotel swimming pool in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, signify the big time to Tim Lippe (Ed Helms, above center), a 34-year-old insurance salesman and naïf arriving from Brown Valley, Wis., for a convention. An orphan, he has sought fatherly advice from his boss (Stephen Root) and something less maternal from his seventh-grade teacher (Sigourney Weaver). Soon he's trapped between the forces of his suite mate, Ronald Wilkes (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), a man of reason, and of Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly), the gathering's vulgar center of attention. Then there's Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Anne Heche), the melancholy party girl who tugs at his heartstrings. But what Tim has really come for is the Two Diamonds Award, which he is meant to bring back to Brown Valley at whatever cost. ''Part of what's satisfying about 'Cedar Rapids,' which was directed by Miguel Arteta ('The Good Girl') from a smart, generous script by Phil Johnston, is that it takes both Tim and his joy seriously, and without self-congratulatory winks and nudges,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Tim is funny, with his Ken-doll hair and sweater vests, wide-eyed wonder and fear ('There's an Afro-American man standing in my room,' he says with dismay on meeting a suite mate), but he only looks like a punch line.'' She added: ''It's a modest journey of a modest man that Mr. Arteta smartly doesn't inflate.'' Joan may call him Insurance Man, a kind of superhero, ''but Tim isn't super anything (though he proves heroic), and what makes 'Cedar Rapids' a low-wattage pleasure is its insistence that his ordinariness -- with his decency and sense of wonder -- is pretty extraordinary.'' 10 A.M.

When the director Pascal-Alex Vincent caught wind (as all locals eventually do) of these ''hot twins who fight,'' he cast them in his short film ''Bebe Requin,'' which competed at Cannes in 2005, and later as the leads in ''Donne-Moi la Main,'' a movie inspired by their bellicose proclivities. As villains in this month's ''Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,'' the twins will undoubtedly earn even wider recognition.

Even in outer Mongolia, where they lawlessly pan for gold, the resemblance to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is unmistakable. For years, they have furtively worked at abandoned commercial mines and on the edges of active mining sites, sleeping in canvas tents and laboring for 12 hours a day. But the 21st-century gold rush has pushed them into national parks, encroaching on the border with Siberia. Environmentalists say the ninjas are destroying pristine rivers and grasslands with their mining methods, which involve cyanide and mercury. Even the ninjas, many of them out-of-work herders, recognize the damage, but they say there is no other way to earn a livelihood in rural Mongolia. The mining can be dangerous, difficult and cold: at the snow-covered sites where the ninja miners work, temperatures can drop below minus-50.

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"For someone like me, someone like her presents an existential problem. Conditioned as I am to peering under the surfaces of things and sussing out the dark truth, how am I to parse the enigma of transparency - the lack of discernible neuroses, the absence of characterological curveballs - that is Tory Burch? Despite her many roles as a ragingly successful business entrepreneur, divorced mother of three sons and devoted stepmother to three daughters, crack skier and tennis ace, adored friend, philanthropist, consummate hostess and general woman about town, she is disconcertingly all of a piece. There is - but how can this be? Can Dostoyevsky be all wrong? - no lurking secret self, no rattling skeletons. What you see, as God knows how many people have told me about her, ranging from her own mother to the society maven Billy Norwich, is what you get. And what you get, as far as I can tell, having spent some time with her and having talked to numerous people about her, is someone annoyingly close to perfect. Someone it would be nice to dislike, if she were only dislikable. Someone it's impossible not to envy, if only because her life seems sun drenched from the get-go, with a childhood that sounds near magical, spent climbing trees and romping with her brothers and the German shepherds her parents bred on a 35-acre gentleman's farm in Valley Forge, Pa., replete with tennis court and swimming pool. But here I am sitting with her at lunch in early October at one of her favorite haunts - Kelly and Ping on Greene Street in SoHo - and what I can't help noticing immediately is that she really listens, not like a person pretending to be interested until she gets the chance to talk but like someone who's actually intrigued by what you have to say. Right now, for instance, we are discussing the ordeal of clinical depression - one of my favorite subjects. My sense is that bleakness is not a component of Burch's inner landscape (indeed, her sister-in-law Patty Isen tells me that she's ''not that kind of person''), but all the same she seems compassionate, tells me about a dear friend of hers who suffers from the disease. For a moment or two I forget that I am here to interview her, rather than vice versa."

The ring was given to me by someone I love, and I can still see his creased, anxious face the night I opened the box. It was designed by David Webb, a name that had personal associations for me of New York; some borrowed from Vogue and W in the '70s, others from those bird cages of rapture, the ''women's pages'' in newspapers, where praise for Webb's jewels was constant and vaguely haughty. Some years later, in the '90s, if I happened to be in the vicinity of 57th Street and Park Avenue, I would glance toward the David Webb shop, a fortress marked by a sleek nameplate, and think the place was somehow equal to a private bank or club. Which just goes to show you what a myth New York is, or as Truman Capote called it, ''a diamond iceberg.'' It would be years, and the gift of a ring, before I would be able to appreciate the remarkable genius of David Webb."

And this issue contains an extraordinary number of all of the above. Jane Herman and Ethel Park's selection of presents (Page 103) is as delightful and diverse as one could hope for. Their strategy for those on your list? Give a small bundle of items that, taken together, provide charming commentary on the personality of the giftee. They love canary yellow diamonds (hello, Rihanna!) with a crane-shaped bedside lamp, sandals for the beach with a jigsaw puzzle and stormproof matches (monsoon insurance!), local green eggs and Dutch eco magazines. It's an adorable and adult spin on a Christmas stocking. (In the course of their shopping, they unearthed and juxtaposed a vast number of cool items; visit our Web site for even more.) Of course, when we talk about gifts, we also look beyond the wrapping paper. There is the gift of great writing: we are delighted to share a part of Emmanuel Carrère's ''Lives Other Than My Own'' (Page 117), his meditation on loss in the wake of the Asian tsunami of 2004, and to publish Joan Juliet Buck's memoir of a Christmas spent in Venice, fitfully and miserably, with her parents and Peter O'Toole (Page 140).

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"High up in an apartment block in Toronto, Viggo Mortensen was padding around barefoot, cleaning up the kitchen after lunch and speaking, in his soft-voiced way, about his longing for immortality. ''I'm not afraid of death,'' he said, wiping down a counter with a damp cloth, ''but I resent it. I think it's unfair and irritating. Every time I see something beautiful, I not only want to return to it, but it makes me want to see other beautiful things. I know I'm not going to get to all the places I want to go. I'm not going to read all the books I want to read. I'm not going to revisit certain paintings as many times as I would like. There's a limit.'' He paused. ''I mean, I understand limits are good for character and all that, but I would rather live forever.'' Mortensen's combination of cheekbones and limpid-eyed sincerity has tended to inspire a slightly awestruck tone in journalists over the years. Some of their more breathless accounts of his chilled-out, barefoot demeanor have come perilously close to making him sound a bit of a pill: a parody of the soulful gypsy artiste, all flared nostrils and rippling Kant quotations. Happily, he is not really as oppressively soulful or as grandiose as such reports might suggest. He is earnest, God knows, and his pronouncements on life and art verge, occasionally, on the sententious. But he's not a preening nostril-flarer. What he brings to mind, more than anything, is your older brother's hippie friend from childhood - the one who played you your first Velvet Underground album and instructed you in Trotskyist politics. He has the same lank-haired seriousness, and - oddly enough - the same shyness. He also has, for what it's worth, one of the strangest and unsexiest laughs in America: a kind of abrupt, feminine cackle that is liable to make you jump if you're not expecting it."

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt's star turns in ''50/50'' and ''Inception'' may have overshadowed the recent success of his online passion project, hitRECord.org. The Web site invites artists from all walks of life to collaborate with the actor, resulting in music, short films and, now, a picture book called ''The Tiny Book of Tiny Stories'' ($15). The sweetly amateurish story collection is the first in a trilogy of titles from It Books, part of the publishing giant HarperCollins. Here Gordon-Levitt, 30, explains why this book deal is not just a coup for his young company but also an object lesson in how it works. The book is made up of roughly 45 illustrated stories culled from about 8,600 online submissions. Why does it have a predigital, ziney feel even though it came from this newfangled Web concept? I think that has less to do with the methodology and more with my personal taste and also the taste of the artist named Wirrow, who started this ''Tiny Stories'' collaboration in 2010. Wirrow is this artist who lives in England. He never gives out his real name and he never shows his face. He prefers to sort of remain anonymous, although we became friends recently when I was shooting ''The Dark Knight Rises'' in London."

The top contender: green, and more specifically pale, mellow, minty green, introduced in the resort collections as a prelude to spring's more pastel-centric palette (only a few months away). This green's dustier renditions - as seen on the spring runway at Theyskens' Theory - act similar to a khaki or olive green and can be worn as easily. ''We treat it like a neutral,'' says Acne's Jonny Johansson, who did suede leggings in the softest jade hue. ''It's like our gray.'' From the Row, a pair of silk pants in the prettiest sea foam need nothing more than a bit of shine - jacket or jewels - to make them evening-appropriate. ''The mint would look great paired with any metallic, silver or gold,'' say the designers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen about their elegant, Deco-esque pant. Now, that's refreshing.

The following excerpt is adapted from ''Lives Other Than My Own,'' which was published in September by Metropolitan Books. The night before the wave, I remember that Helene and I talked about separating. It wouldn't be complicated; we didn't live together, hadn't had a child and were even able to see ourselves remaining friends, and yet, it was sad. It was Christmas 2004. Here we were in our bungalow at the Hotel Eva Lanka, and we couldn't help remembering a different night, just after we'd met, a night we'd spent marveling that we had found each other and would never part and would grow old together, happy for the rest of our lives. We even talked about having a child, a little girl. We did have that little girl in the end, and we still trust that we'll live out our days together. But after the dazzling confidence of love at first sight came a complex, chaotic year, and what had at first seemed so certain to us (and still seems so now) no longer appeared at all certain or even desirable. Lying side by side, we couldn't bring ourselves to mention that first night. She went out on the terrace to smoke a cigarette. I waited for her, lying on the bed and thinking, If she comes back soon, if we make love, then perhaps we won't separate, perhaps we will grow old together after all. But she did not come back. She remained alone on the terrace and I fell asleep, sad, lonely, convinced that my life could get only worse and worse."

''I didn't throw the ball very well,'' he said after the game, a 35-26 win over Tampa Bay on Nov. 20. ''I'm not trying to be ridiculously humble right now. I'm just frustrated.'' Rodgers's quotation shines a light on a major problem gripping the N.F.L.: ridiculous humility, the absurd self-denigration to which great players succumb when they avoid expressing satisfaction or joy at achieving anything short of seven straight Super Bowl championships. We have grown so used to hearing Tom Brady-types say ''we still have a lot of work to do'' after 38-20 victories that we fail to notice that it has transcended professionalism or constructive criticism, becoming a pantomime of masochistic self denial. With Rodgers at least addressing the ridiculous humility phenomenon and Charles Woodson acknowledging last month that an undefeated season is a desirable goal, the Packers now represent the vanguard of football honesty: the one team daring enough to occasionally express pride. Rodgers should throw for 400 yards against a Giants defense full of rookies and backups. He may still feel frustrated after the game. Imagine how Tom Coughlin will feel. Pick: Packers."

Not on his glossy girls, bien sur. ''We get their hair into amazing condition and give them color that sparkles.'' Fine examples: ''The most beautiful colors, to me, are the ones that respect a woman's natural base,'' Fritas says. ''Many women have bad color, and it's because they strayed too far from what works with their complexion.'' Uniform color is modern, he says, and he prefers warm shades to cool ones. ''I don't do her hair, but I love Vanessa Paradis's coppery cinnamon hue.'' He does do Heidi Klum's signature blond tresses. ''She's adventuresome, so it's fun to work with her.'' Freja Beha wins in the brunette stakes. ''Her color's very natural and always looks cool without being extreme.''"

Not that he is trying to steal Pat Buckley's tiara or anything. ''Hostess books,'' as they're still sometimes called, may be a creaky social nicety associated with the kind of women who spent afternoons at Kenneth having their hair teased, but it's surprising how many people hang on to them out of sheer usefulness - for remembering that the paella was so dreadful it should be taken out of circulation, that the sweet peas merit a replay.

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Charles D. Avery Dennison Corp. mourns the passing of Charles D. ""Chuck"" Miller, visionary business builder and civic leader, who died November 23, 2011 at the age of 83. In his 47-year association with Avery Dennison, Chuck was instrumental in transforming the company from a U.S.-based manufacturer into a global Fortune 500 market leader in pressure-sensitive labeling materials and office products. As chairman for 17 years and CEO for 21, he drove the company's growth with creativity, courage and confidence, and every aspect of the business -- from vision to strategy to execution to culture -- was shaped for the better by his passion and imagination. Corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California bears his name in recognition of his impact. Chuck translated the qualities that made him such an exceptional businessman into a deep commitment to civic leadership. Among the many roles he filled with distinction were: chairman of the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, director of numerous Southern California companies, chairman of United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and co-created with Peter Mullin the Mullin-Miller Million Dollar Match Fund to encourage giving to the United Way Pathways Out of Poverty Plan during the recent severe recession. He also supported a wide range of medical institutions, including Operation Walk, which provides total hip and knee replacements to the impoverished and which he personally nurtured from a local into an international organization. A lifelong lover of athletics, he was one of the first members of the organizing committee that brought the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles, and helped establish the Los Angeles Sports Council and the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (today the LA84 Foundation). He provided extensive support to the U.S. Lacrosse and personally funded the women's varsity lacrosse program at Occidental College, which today is a national power in the sport. A deep believer in liberal arts education, Chuck was especially devoted to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. He served as university trustee and presidential counselor, endowing the Charles D. Miller Professorship in the humanities at the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and creating the Vision Fund, a scholarship program for arts and sciences undergraduates and summer students of the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. In 1998, he received the Heritage Award in recognition of his outstanding service to Johns Hopkins. He also had a long association with Occidental College, serving as a trustee from 1977 to 1998 and continuing thereafter as a trustee emeritus. He remained an active businessman, civic leader and philanthropist after retiring from Avery Dennison. He invested in real estate and owned and operated a wine company, the noted Jackson Hole restaurant Koshu, and a highly successful stable of thoroughbred horses. At the time of his death, he was a member of the executive board of the Rose Bowl Legacy Campaign for the renovation and preservation of the Rose Bowl, a member of the advisory board of the Autry Museum of Western Heritage and a trustee of Southern California Public Radio. The company expresses its deepest condolences to his wife, Carolyn; his daughters Amanda Daly Miller, Candice Louise Miller, Katherine Ann Miller, Susie Cherrill Otten and Charlotte Juanita Miller; and his grandchildren Laura, David, Eric and John Otten, and Harper, Juliet and Zander Branch. Funeral services will be private.

My husband thought he ought to call, anyway. ''Listen to this,'' he began, and as soon as I heard the words ''Dear madam, the prime minister has asked me to inform you . . .''

2011-12-04T00:00:00Z,"Raquel Zimmermann's blond hair and blue eyes do not, for most people, immediately say Brazil. But the model who has been the face of brands like Lanvin, McQueen and Shiseido arrived on the fashion scene from Bom Retiro do Sul, a small town in the south of the country, where boatloads of German immigrants began arriving in the 1800s. (Zimmermann's hometown is not too far from that of Gisele Bundchen, and it's easy to imagine that the two women share a similar gene pool.) The region is so Teutonic, in fact, that her parents now live in a city called Novo Hamburgo, a Bavarian-seeming burg where many of the old buildings are made of timber. Because Zimmermann wasn't raised steeped in samba and coconut water, it came as a surprise when she suggested the Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha as the place she'd like to go to shoot resort wear. ''I figured it was probably time to start exploring my own country,'' says the lanky beauty, who has seen plenty of the rest of the world in her 13 years in front of the camera. About as close to Senegal as it is to Sao Paulo, Noronha is one of the few places on the planet that strikes the right balance between tourist destination and nature preserve, limiting visitors to about 700 a day and strictly overseeing development. It's a fact that was not lost on Zimmermann, whose obvious pride in her country and boundless curiosity - in her spare time she surfs, meditates and does yoga - was positively contagious. Over two days spent tooling around in dune buggies, the island's usual mode of transportation, she was hard to keep up with. She navigated across bumpy roads, took to the sea on a tiny fishing boat, hiked over treacherous terrain, chased after lizards, frolicked on hot, burning beaches and put away bowl after bowl of moqueca, the traditional Brazilian fish stew. And when she learned that there was a famous cave on the island called Buraco da Raquel, literally Raquel's hole, she squealed with delight: ''We have to go there!''"

The sale reflects not only the continuing demand for ultraluxury penthouses, but also the resurgence of a building that had seen some rough early days. The three-bedroom 3,164-square-foot condominium had been under contract in spring 2008 when sales at the building, 15 Union Square West, were first announced. But the market collapsed that fall, the contract fell through, and transactions in the building stalled."

They met after a concert, fell in love and started making clothes. Les Aperizes is Laurence Nguyen and Brian Tamborello's debut spring collection. And like their story, the couple's style is wildly romantic: preciously made petal-collar silk dresses, blouses detailed with hand-embroidered French knots and fluidly tailored trousers (all priced between $240 and $1,350). ''Before ever sketching, we like to talk about a woman as if we're writing a character and imagine what she wears throughout different times in her life,'' says Nguyen, who sees herself as the line's dreamer and Tamborello as its down-to-earth craftsman. Regarding the latter, the cut is slouchy sexy and thoughtfully undone. Tamborello says: ''We ask ourselves, 'Can we picture our clothes on every character? Will they age beautifully with her?' '' Stores like Barneys New York and Ikram in Chicago sure think so. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born, lived and is buried, was a bustling hub of middle-class black life. But as Atlantans raced to the suburbs, this stretch of factories and shotgun houses east of downtown fell into decay. Now, the neighborhood is generating buzz again -- as a cradle of culinary and artistic innovation and as a symbol of gentrification, with a more racially mixed population. Named for a former voting district, the O4W (in Atlanta shorthand) is being recharged by a wave of new art galleries, nightclubs and restaurants. This summer, the area's largest building, a 2.1-million-square-foot former Sears, was sold to developers and is to be turned into an enormous mixed-use space by 2014. ROBBIE BROWN"

2011-12-05T00:00:00Z,"Fado, the Portuguese tradition of elegant, emotive songs filled with tragedy and longing, was named to Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in late November. By happy coincidence the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music had scheduled two nights of fado that began Friday with a concert featuring the United States debut of Camané, 44, a major star in Portugal who is one of his generation's leading fado singers, or fadistas. At this concert fado's past was never far from its present. Camané performs in a genre dominated by women. Fado (which means ''fate'') was defined for decades by its greatest singer, Amália Rodrigues, who died in 1999. It was music forged in the clubs called fado houses in Lisbon, entwining Portuguese song with tinges of Arabic music and echoes of the Portuguese empire returning to that port city: from Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde and perhaps Macao. Fado became the national style of Portugal under the dictatorship that ended in 1974; although it was largely spurned during the 1970s, a younger generation embraced its musicality as the political taint receded."

Well, not exactly. Madonna, the singer and multi-hyphenate whose resume includes such albums as ''Like a Virgin,'' ''Erotica'' and ''Hard Candy,'' the documentary ''Truth or Dare'' and a coffee-table photography book modestly (for her) titled ''Sex,'' will perform at the halftime show of the Super Bowl, which will be on Feb. 5 at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The announcement was made during NBC's ''Sunday Night Football'' broadcast of a game between the Detroit Lions and the New Orleans Saints, confirming reports that emerged in October that the N.F.L. was in discussions with Madonna."

This special issue takes a many-faceted look at a set of technologies that are changing the world in more ways than could ever have been foreseen.

As Theodor Holm Nelson points out in the essay that concludes this issue, we are definitely headed somewhere: ''A wall? A cliff? A new dawn? We must choose wisely, as if we could.''"

''West of Memphis'' is directed by Amy Berg (''Deliver Us From Evil''). Its producers include the ''Lord of the Rings'' director Peter Jackson, as well as Damien Echols, one of the three defendants, who were teenagers in 1994 when they were convicted of killing three 8-year-old boys in West Memphis, Ark. The three defendants were released from prison in August. The feature arrives on the heels of the ''Paradise Lost'' documentary series, produced by HBO and directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, that has also chronicled the case and has occasionally come into conflict with Ms. Berg's film over interview access with key figures in the case. Other out-of-competition premieres will include Stephen Frears's ''Lay the Favorite,'' Spike Lee's ''Red Hook Summer'' and ''Something From Nothing: The Art of Rap,'' a documentary directed by Ice-T."

2011-12-06T00:00:00Z,"The film critic David Denby reportedly broke an industry embargo by publishing his review of David Fincher's ''Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' in this week's issue of The New Yorker, and Sony, the studio releasing the film, is not happy. Other critics had agreed not to write about the film until closer to its Dec. 21 release date. At 2 a.m. on Sunday, Sony sent critics a message reminding them to stick to the terms the studio set and singling out Mr. Denby; Scott Rudin, the producer of ''Dragon Tattoo,'' followed up by sending Mr. Denby a terse e-mail. In Mr. Rudin's view Sony feared that Mr. Denby's early review would force other publications to publish their critiques too far in advance of the movie's opening, and Mr. Denby broke his word to the studio. According to a transcript of the e-mail exchange online at IndieWire, Mr. Denby said his early review had less to do with any code of conduct than with the year-end pileup of quality movies, and The New Yorker's abbreviated production schedule. He liked the movie, calling it a ''bleak but mesmerizing piece of filmmaking.'' That the review is positive is immaterial, Mr. Rudin said, adding that Mr. Denby would be disinvited to advance screenings of any of his movies, including another long-awaited title, ''Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.''"

The desk has letters scratched into its surface, as though they were the carvings of a naughty school child. Mr. Boyce beat out the installation sculptor Karla Black, the video artist Hilary Lloyd and the painter George Shaw. The five-person jury, led by Penelope Curtis, director of Tate Britain, said ''his work uses his knowledge of historic design to create distinctive sculptural installations.'' The prize, which was established in 1984 and named after the 19th-century landscape painter J.M.W. Turner, is given annually to a British artist under 50 for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the 12 months before April 4, 2011.

It typically involves a coterie of the world's hottest models jetting to an exquisitely remote clime - the Seychelles, say, or Botswana - to be photographed, nude, by an elite fashion photographer. The calendar began inauspiciously as a pinup that grease monkeys would post at continental service stations. But just like in the case of Michelin's influential guidebook, it took on a life of its own and now its connection to motoring seems completely incidental. (One must give props to all these European tire makers for their enduring contributions to world culture; the best thing our own Goodyear has come up with so far is a blimp.)"

2011-12-07T15:15:41Z,"Azzedine Alaïa has never obeyed the fashion calendar and shows only when he - and his clothes - are good and ready. In fact, in recent years, the designer, who is now in his 70s, has probably had as many runway presentations as museum exhibitions, including the one that opens this weekend at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands. ""Azzedine Alaïa in the 21st Century"" focuses solely on his output from roughly the past decade, and yet there is more substance there than many designers could ever hope to achieve in a lifetime, including the fierce tailcoat above and a toothsome evening dress with a zipper that spirals suggestively around the body from the neck to the floor. Always the perfectionist in the pursuit of beauty (he's often referred to as a ""sculptor of women's bodies""), Alaïa apparently recut or totally remade many of the pieces in the show to the exact proportions of the mannequins. In an open love letter to the designer, Mark Wilson, who curated the exhibition, writes, ""I'm sure that certain people may wonder why we are doing this one more time?"" referring to a massive Alaïa exhibition at the Groninger Museum back in in 1997-98. Wilson promptly answers his own question: ""Because you are the last great couturier working today."""
2011-12-07T15:15:04Z,"The members of the electronic dance music group Underworld have been named the musical directors for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London, organizers announced on Wednesday.

It is not the first time Mr. Boyle has chosen Mr. Smith and Mr. Hyde to provide the soundtrack for one of his projects. The group is perhaps best known for its dance track ""Born Slippy,"" which first appeared in a scene from Mr. Boyle's 1996 film ""Trainspotting."" Since then, they have created music for four other projects by Mr. Boyle, including a National Theater production of ""Frankenstein"" that received high praise from critics. Mr. Boyle said the hiring of Underworld to write music for the Games was ""the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle"" and praised the duo's creative range. Mr. Hyde said the chance to compose for the Olympics was a great honor. ""We want to leave people with a musical memory of the show rather than a purely visual one,"" he said in a statement."

The studded peep-toe booties, satin flats, polka-dot platforms and bow-embellished kitten heels carry many of the brand's signatures, but share none of them collectively. What all of the shoes do share is a handwritten time stamp - a numerical record of the amount of time it took to make each pair. For example, the sequence etched into a pair of silver chain wedge heels is 47.41'50"", denoting 47 hours, 41 minutes and 50 seconds. ""When we talk about luxury and time, it's clear that there's a strong connection between the two,"" says Maria Grazia Chiuri, one of the house's two co-designers. ""Time is the new luxury, and luxury does not exist without time and the consciousness of a unique tradition."" Classic Italian craftsmanship still exists (Valentino is known for its old Florentine factories), but in an age of fast everything it's easy to forget our Old World cobblers: the one devoted to flowers, the one who specializes in crystals and another with expertise in lace, for example. Pierpaolo Piccioli, Chiuri's design partner, adds, ""It's nice to know that you're buying a kind of cultural process."" Milled plexiglass and velvet wedges marked 38H? At $1,295, that's $34 an hour, if you break it down. And yes, it's worth it."

''In the old days, they'd warm the drink by putting a hot poker into the glass,'' said Matthew Piacentini, who owns the Beagle in the East Village, which just started serving what he calls ''twilight toddies.'' Bartenders steam the drinks in an espresso machine. ''That way, you heat them without diluting them too much,'' Mr. Piacentini said. Because balancing the flavors in drinks without ice is exacting, he said, the toddies are generally not offered after 7:30 p.m., when the bar and restaurant get busy.

This, in theory, would give downtrodden shareholders a premium return - one that they have been hungering for since the board turned down Microsoft's offer to buy the company at $31 a share in 2008. A full sale would also relieve the Yahoo board of the headache-inducing task of rebuilding the Yahoo business and hiring a new chief executive."

Oysters, smoked salmon or other smoked fish, mushrooms, barbecue, cheeses, steak, offal, game, roast chicken, Caesar salad, chocolate cake, the list goes on and on. Dark, dried fruit poached in spiced lapsang souchong, a smoky black tea, and flamed with Scotch becomes almost liquid fruitcake for the holiday season.

Merck's step suggests that the pharmaceutical industry's center of gravity is shifting eastward accordingly.

Mr. Obama correctly framed the choice for voters: The country can return to policies that stacked the deck for the wealthy and left everyone else to fend for themselves, creating what he called ''you're on your own economics.''

Shawn Armbrust, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, said, ''After serving nearly 27 years for crimes that he didn't commit, Mr. Haynesworth has had to register as a sex offender and abide by degrading conditions while the Court of Appeals took nearly nine months to conclude that the attorney general and the prosecutors were right that Mr. Haynesworth didn't commit these crimes.''"

2011-12-07T00:00:00Z,"In the art room at P.S. 188 in Bayside, Queens, a group of 9-year-olds was busily putting the finishing touches on an enormous poster for the fourth-grade play. Its topic: saving the Earth. Down the hall in the music room, beneath portraits of Mozart and Bach, classmates were breaking into a spirited rendition of ''Hear Those Bells'' on fluorescent-colored recorders. Cheerleaders in the gym were perfecting a victory chant, jumping, twisting and stamping their feet. And in the library, children in a Suzuki violin class were toiling away at ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,'' while their music teacher, a professional violist from Iceland, coached them ''to stand straight and tall.'' All of this concentrated learning -- activities parents commonly think of as enrichment -- was taking place not after school hours, but during recess, the once-unstructured midday break that for some elementary school students is slowly being squeezed out of the day."

The vodka starts in Missouri, where it is distilled from corn mixed with organic upstate New York wheat. The overproof distillate is shipped to Brooklyn Republic's Clinton Hill plant, where it is brought down to 80 proof with filtered Brooklyn tap water, then filtered several more times before being sealed in handsome bottles.

I had the passion, to be sure, even if my after-work bartending adventures only sporadically get beyond the pour-bourbon-on-top-of-ice stage. And the mission had seemed simple enough. The idea was to attempt to make a few recipes from the most buzzed-about cocktail guide in the country, ''The PDT Cocktail Book'' (Sterling Epicure; $24.95) by Jim Meehan. It's a mesmerizing volume. Start flipping through it and you can't help but be transported, sort of like Jack Nicholson in ''The Shining,'' to some faraway Jazz Age bacchanal where the bartenders muddle blueberries with half an ounce of Crème Yvette, pour in some Cognac and Champagne, and top off this ambrosial sip with an edible orchid. (At PDT, in the East Village, they really do that. See Page 147: the Imperial Blueberry Fizz. Sigh.) What would happen if I tried to conjure up a few of these speakeasy dreams in my own home, in the gridlocked, Yellowtail-friendly suburbs?"

The Roots, led by Ahmir (Questlove) Thompson on drums and the rapper Black Thought, are determined to focus attention on the bleak prospects of poor urban youth. They uphold pre-gangsta ideals of hip-hop as a history and outcry, while they reinvent hip-hop as music for a live band rather than for D.J.'s and programmers. They delve thoroughly into an African-American heritage of funk and soul, and they apply a fan's and a curator's curiosity to genres from indie-rock to Afro-beat. They mingle personal and political messages, reach out to older generations, reverse-engineer vintage songs and fearlessly experiment in their own music.

Nudo Panettone, $25 plus shipping for 35.27 ounces, must be ordered by Dec. 19 for delivery before Christmas, from nudo-italia.com; if any are available after that date, they can be ordered for later delivery.

She was born in New York City on December 3, 1927, the daughter of Phillip and Lillian Leff. She graduated from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Sarah Lawrence College. She was the cherished wife of Jerome Siegel, adored mother of Michael Levin and Laurence de Segonzac-Levin, Stephen and Amy Levin, Robin Levin, William and Sharon Levin, Henry and Talia Siegel, Elizabeth and David Carpenter, and Carol Siegel, dear sister of Joseph Leff and sister-in-law Juanita, double first cousin to life long confidantes Marjorie Miller and Maxine Myers, devoted grandmother of Alex, Max-Andre, Sebastien, Samantha, Eli, Noah, Sarah, Rachel, Matthew, David, Emma, Hannah, Alexis, Jayden, Ellah, Tessa, Adam and mentor to Luis Batista. In her lifelong pursuit of artistic excellence, Ruth founded and led Art Latitude Gallery and the Ruth Siegel Art Gallery, where she nurtured and brought to prominence major young American artists. She contributed as a board member of MoMA PS1 and the Museum of Arts and Design, as well as the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies and Channel 13 Art Auctions.

Ruth was an active supporter of the Democratic Party, hosting former President William Clinton and Hillary Clinton at her home on several occasions. She was selected to be a member of the delegation accompanying Vice President Al Gore to Warsaw in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Ruth was also a generous contributor to national, state and local candidates. In the realm of health care, Ruth was on the Board of Patient Care of New York Presbyterian Hospital, and with Jerome endowed the Stroke Center at White Plains Hospital and child care services in La Romana, Dominican Republic. In the field of medical research, she and Jerome were early and devoted supporters of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, endowing a Chair of Virology. As a champion tennis player, in a career filled with trophies, she belonged to Beach Point Club and New Rochelle Tennis Club, added golf to her many athletic accomplishments at Quaker Ridge Golf Club, and excelled in bridge and duplicate bridge with Jerome at The Harmonie Club and the Regency Whist Club. Forty-four years ago Ruthie married her soul mate Jerome and they have been dancing on top of the world ever since. Always smiling, Ruth strove each day to ensure the happiness of her family and epitomized grace under pressure. Her radiant beauty, optimism, exquisite style and grace, joy for life, spirit of adventure, exuberance and, above all, her endless love of family and friends, will live in our hearts forever. Funeral Services will be held at Westchester Reform Temple, Scarsdale, New York on Thursday, December 8, 2011 at 12:30pm.

2011-12-08T00:00:00Z,"Browns (4-8) at Steelers (9-3) 8:20 p.m. Eastern, NFL Network Line: Steelers by 11 The Browns' signature play this season has been the dropped pass. Browns receivers have dropped 35 passes, the highest figure in the league, according to Stats LLC. They have collectively dropped more passes than all but one of their receivers has caught. Greg Little leads the team with 15 drops, and few were borderline cases of an off-target pass glancing off his outstretched fingertips. Little's hands and stomach seem to magnetically repel footballs. Running back Montario Hardesty is more culpable than Little, who at least leads the team with 50 receptions. Hardesty has 12 catches and 6 drops, most of them on dump-off passes that travel with all the distance and velocity of a stuffed bunny tossed to a toddler. If the Browns' receivers had caught half the passes they dropped this season, Colt McCoy's completion percentage would be nearly 4 points higher, and more important, the Browns may have won close games against the Rams and the Bengals."

2011-12-08T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Ruth (nee Leff), died at home peacefully on December 5, 2011 at the age of 84 after a courageous battle with pancreatic cancer. Our beloved Ruthie was the lodestar of family and friends, a passionate supporter of the arts, politics, her alma mater Sarah Lawrence, hospital research and patient care in New York, Israel and the Dominican Republic, a fiercely competitive athlete, a beautiful and graceful woman. She was born in New York City on December 3, 1927, the daughter of Phillip and Lillian Leff. She graduated from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Sarah Lawrence College. She was the cherished wife of Jerome Siegel, adored mother of Michael Levin and Laurence de Segonzac-Levin, Stephen and Amy Levin, Robin Levin, William and Sharon Levin, Henry and Talia Siegel, Elizabeth and David Carpenter, and Carol Siegel, dear sister of Joseph Leff and sister-in-law Juanita, double first cousin to life long confidantes Marjorie Miller and Maxine Myers, devoted grandmother of Alex, Max-Andre, Sebastien, Samantha, Eli, Noah, Sarah, Rachel, Matthew, David, Emma, Hannah, Alexis, Jayden, Ellah, Tessa, Adam and mentor to Luis Batista. In her lifelong pursuit of artistic excellence, Ruth founded and led Art Latitude Gallery and the Ruth Siegel Art Gallery, where she nurtured and brought to prominence major young American artists. She contributed as a board member of MoMA PS1 and the Museum of Arts and Design, as well as the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies and Channel 13 Art Auctions. She was a tireless advocate for educational opportunity, as a teacher of young children, as a member of the Board of Trustees for Sarah Lawrence College, where she endowed The Ruth Leff Siegel Center, as a supporter of Westchester Community College and its Siegel Cafe, and as a founding supporter of the Hogar del Nino in the Dominican Republic. Ruth was an active supporter of the Democratic Party, hosting former President William Clinton and Hillary Clinton at her home on several occasions. She was selected to be a member of the delegation accompanying Vice President Al Gore to Warsaw in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Ruth was also a generous contributor to national, state and local candidates. In the realm of health care, Ruth was on the Board of Patient Care of New York Presbyterian Hospital, and with Jerome endowed the Stroke Center at White Plains Hospital and child care services in La Romana, Dominican Republic. In the field of medical research, she and Jerome were early and devoted supporters of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, endowing a Chair of Virology. As a champion tennis player, in a career filled with trophies, she belonged to Beach Point Club and New Rochelle Tennis Club, added golf to her many athletic accomplishments at Quaker Ridge Golf Club, and excelled in bridge and duplicate bridge with Jerome at The Harmonie Club and the Regency Whist Club. Forty-four years ago Ruthie married her soul mate Jerome and they have been dancing on top of the world ever since. Always smiling, Ruth strove each day to ensure the happiness of her family and epitomized grace under pressure. Her radiant beauty, optimism, exquisite style and grace, joy for life, spirit of adventure, exuberance and, above all, her endless love of family and friends, will live in our hearts forever. Funeral Services will be held at Westchester Reform Temple, Scarsdale, New York on Thursday, December 8, 2011 at 12:30pm. Donations in her memory may be made to The Pancreas Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital."

2011-12-08T00:00:00Z,"LENOFF--Jerome H.,born April 7th, 1927, passed surrounded by family in his Pleasantville, NY home on Tuesday, December 6th. A World War II naval veteran, Jerry, as he was known to family and friends, attended the Parsons School of Design on the GI Bill, which launched him into a career in advertising. He worked on Madison Avenue as an award-winning art director and created many memorable campaigns for iconic brands, thoroughly enjoying the creative industry in which he chose to spend his entire career. He retired in 1989 to pursue his other creative loves. He was an accomplished watercolorist, showing his work in galleries throughout Westchester, a photographer and an award-winning gardener. In all these pursuits, he loved capturing the small moments of beauty in the world that often go unnoticed, whether it be the dunes on a Cape Cod beach or the irises from his own garden. He brought these same sensibilities of observing and embracing the world around him to his family. Married for almost 62 years, he supported his wife Audrey as she pursued her own career in education, and celebrated his two children, Michael and Leslee as they went on to careers and families of their own. He was the proud grandfather of Joshua, Jacqueline, Zachary and Julianna and father in-law to Angie and Tom. Private services will be held. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Phelps Hospice or Pleasantville Community Synagogue."

A World War II naval veteran, Jerry, as he was known to family and friends, attended the Parsons School of Design on the GI Bill, which launched him into a career in advertising. He worked on Madison Avenue as an award-winning art director and created many memorable campaigns for iconic brands, thoroughly enjoying the creative industry in which he chose to spend his entire career. He retired in 1989 to pursue his other creative loves. He was an accomplished watercolorist, showing his work in galleries throughout Westchester, a photographer and an award-winning gardener. In all these pursuits, he loved capturing the small moments of beauty in the world that often go unnoticed, whether it be the dunes on a Cape Cod beach or the irises from his own garden. He brought these same sensibilities of observing and embracing the world around him to his family. Married for almost 62 years, he supported his wife Audrey as she pursued her own career in education, and celebrated his two children, Michael and Leslee as they went on to careers and families of their own. He was the proud grandfather of Joshua, Jacqueline, Zachary and Julianna and father in-law to Angie and Tom. Private services will be held. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations to Phelps Hospice or Pleasantville Community Synagogue."

Will Ferrell (above, with Ms. Mitchell) and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the men vying for Melinda's affections in these two separate visions in this Woody Allen movie. '' 'Melinda and Melinda' is perhaps best thought of as an offering to the memories of Ernst Lubitsch and George S. Kaufman, half-forgotten culture heroes whose examples of crisp sophistication deserve to be kept alive for future generations,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But the real reason to appreciate Mr. Allen ''is as an unrivaled pornographer,'' Mr. Scott added. ''I'm not talking about sex; there is some bed hopping in 'Melinda and Melinda,' but the camera always stops at the bedroom door. These days, in any case, the kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes.'' 8:45 A.M.

Mr. Beane also sought inspiration from various literary adaptation of the tale."

2011-12-09T00:00:00Z,"An article on Nov. 26 about the tax strategies used by the businessman and philanthropist Ronald S.

It tries to look at why so many Egyptians voted for Islamic parties, and my bottom-line feeling is that Americans are feeling a bit more panicky than is justified. It's not that Egyptians seek a harsh Islamic regime; rather they think the Islamic candidates have a better record working in their neighborhoods and may be a little less likely to take bribes than other candidates. Plenty of the hand-wringing seems to be coming from Americans who've never actually met a Muslim Brotherhood member or a Salafi, and I'd suggest not overdoing the rhetoric. The picture is more complicated than some Americans seem to think (although I must acknowledge that plenty of Egyptian liberals are worried as well). Read the column and post your thoughts."

2011-12-10T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--C. Gorham (Doc), 90, of Vero Beach, FL, died peacefully on December 8, 2011, of heart failure. Mr. Phillips was the son of Margaret Cook Atwell and Charles Swayne Phillips of Montclair, NJ, where Mr. Phillips was born and resided until his retirement. He attended the Montclair public schools and graduated from Williams College in 1943 where he was president of Phi Beta Kappa and winner of the Dewey Award for excellence. In 1942, he married his high school sweetheart, Martha Belden, and served from 1943 through 1946 in the Army Air Corps. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1948 and established a thriving career at the prominent New York law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood (now Dewey & LeBoeuf), retiring in 1990 as Chairman of the Management Committee. As a young attorney, he worked closely with Governor Thomas E. Dewey and helped develop some of his firm's most prominent clients, including American Can Company, Sinclair Oil Corporation, and Continental Oil Company. In his final decade at Dewey he worked with his partner, Joseph Califano, and others on the implementation of the long-term strategy that has helped propel Dewey & LeBoeuf to the top rank of international firms. He is survived by his wife and four children: Webster B. Phillips, of Montclair; Charles G. Phillips III, of Manhattan; Tacey P. Carroll, of Bronxville, NY; and Tyler A. Phillips of Sonoma, CA; ten grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. In retirement, Mr. Phillips served as Class Agent for the Williams Alumni Fund, winning five consecutive awards for highest participation. He was a skilled public speaker whose presentations always reflected his wonderful sense of humor. His appreciation of humor led him to compile several anthologies of his favorite jokes. He was a trustee of the Montclair Golf Club and the Riomar Club, the Kimberley School, and the Montclair Art Museum, and served on many civic and corporate boards. After his retirement, Mr. Phillips continued his interest in stamp collecting, earned master points in bridge, wrote reminiscences for friends and family, and, with his wife, was an avid traveler. He was a master needle pointer, whose projects included making the cushion that is on the main altar at Westminster Abbey and, with colleagues, the kneeler for the Dean of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate are Maggie and Grace, their exasperated wives, who decide to give their husbands a week's break from fidelity, which the men gleefully accept, heading with a coterie of sidekicks (Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell and J B Smoove) to hit the singles scene. First stop, Applebee's. And Nicky Whelan is Leigh, the comely barista Rick (Mr. Wilson, above left, with Mr. Sudeikis) can't take his eyes off. ''In 'Hall Pass' the Farrellys are exploring nominally adult realms, like marital fatigue and cheating, but too often these apparent good intentions get the best of them and their timing,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. ''Mr. Wilson, a naturally amusing screen presence, looks uneasy delivering relationship lines that could have been fed to him by Dr. Phil. He and the big-baby-faced Mr. Sudeikis were born to trade quips and suffer mutual comic humiliation.'' Still, she added, ''the Farrellys aren't the only contemporary filmmakers who have a tough time making marriage funny, even if it is heartening to see them try.'' 8 P.M.

The appeal must be approved by United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who in September dismissed nine of the 11 counts filed by the trustee against the Mets' owners. At the time, he ruled that Irving H. Picard, the trustee, had to prove that Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the Mets' owners, willfully turned a blind eye to indications of possible fraud in Madoff's operation during their years of investing with him. ''Willful blindness'' is a higher legal standard to meet than the one that Picard has argued for. The Mets' owners have denied being aware of any red flags about Madoff."

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"CRANBERG--Lawrence M.,PhD. Lawrence Cranberg, 94, passed away on November 21, 2011 surrounded by his loving family. Cancer was the cause of death. Lawrence, a true patriot, was born on the 4th of July in 1917 in Bronx, New York, the eldest child of Fanny Rubenstein and Hyman Cranberg Polish and Russian immigrants. Lawrence married Charlotte Mount on October 31, 1953 in New Mexico at the Old Santa Fe Courthouse. A nuclear physicist, inventor and entrepreneur, Dr. Cranberg's career spanned seven decades, but the wonder and beauty of science was always on his mind. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School at age 16, he matriculated from the City College of New York, Harvard University, and The University of Pennsylvania. His career in science began in 1940 at the Signal Corps. Engineering Labs where he was a Senior Physicist. Dr. Cranberg developed systems of target detection and location-based use of infra-red radiation, a precursor technology to today's autofocus cameras. He later joined the Los Alamos National Laboratory where he became a fellow of the Atomic Energy Commission. At Los Alamos, he was a protege of Hans Bethe, and conducted groundbreaking research on high energy neutrons. Dr. Cranberg was appointed to the US delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy at Geneva in 1955 where he reported on his work. Among his many widely-cited publications were papers in The Scientific American and Physics Today. Dr. Cranberg also generously shared his intuitive insights with colleagues; one such insight directly led to the discovery of the neutrino. Dr. Cranberg was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1958 his nomination made by 1995 Nobelist and neutrino pioneer Frederick Reines and J.M.B. Kellogg. Once introduced as ""Mr. Nanosecond"" by Sir Denys Wilkinson to a London physics conference, Dr. Cranberg developed the means to measure a billionth of second before ""nanotechnology"" was a word; his ""time-of-flight"" method of measuring neutron spectra became the foundation for neutron spectrometry. Following a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962, Dr. Cranberg was instrumental in securing a large federal grant to the University of Virginia to build and to become founding director of its Physics Accelerator Laboratory. He was a devoted scientist and teacher. Thirty years later, one of his grateful graduate students would endow a scholarship and faculty research in his name at George Mason University, remarking that Dr. Cranberg inspired him by exemplifying the work ethic of American scientists. Dr. Cranberg didn't hesitate to fight for justice whether it be the case of his own academic freedom, or his involvement in the lawsuit that eventually forced UVA to accept women into its formerly all-male undergraduate school. In 1971, after winning an AAUP hearing that declared his academic freedom had been invaded, Dr. Cranberg moved to Austin where he joined a small high-tech company, eventually starting his own firm to develop fast-neutron techniques for the treatment of cancer. He was always grateful for the welcome arms of the private sector and of Texas, calling it ""The Land of Milk and Honey"". In 1975, Dr. Cranberg applied the laws of physics to fire-building and invented the Texas Fireframe grate. Later dubbed ""The Physicist's Fire"" by Time magazine, his invention was featured in news stories on CBS and BBC. His company is now run by his daughter. An advocate for social causes throughout his life, Dr. Cranberg fought for racial equality in Virginia (he also recruited the first black graduate physics student at UVA), for the freedom of Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov and for scientists and inventors not properly credited for their work. He wrote incisively about topics from the ethical problems of scientists to the pseudoscientific basis of Marxism. Dr. Cranberg's candidacy for the U.S. Senate from Texas was inspired by his desire for science to better inform decisions in and of the law. Dr. Cranberg's capacity for indignation at injustice was matched only by his optimistic belief in his ability to fight for change and to make a difference. Dr. Cranberg was a loving, devoted husband, father and grandfather: his last words were ""I'm the richest man in the world."" His enthusiasm, generosity, sense of humor and his quest for knowledge, truth, and justice are just a few of the qualities that his family, friends and colleagues will always remember him for. Dr. Cranberg is survived by Charlotte, wife of 58 years; son Alex of Austin, Texas; daughter Nicole and husband Giff Crosby of Cos Cob, Connecticut; and grandchildren Jacob, Hannah and Clare. Other surviving family members include brother, Gilbert Cranberg of Sarasota, Florida and sister, Sylvia Troy of Beverly Shores, Indiana. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorial donations be made to the Niels Bohr Physics Library Center for History of Physics: https://donate.aip.org/ Please type ""In Honor of Lawrence Cranberg"" in the comments box. A memorial service will be held by the family at a later date. To share memories, please visit http://texasfireframe.com/ fireplace-grate-blog/ 2011/11/24/remembering-lawrence-cranberg/"

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"SCHUMANN--Robert Ford, born July 25, 1921, in Montclair, NJ, son of Florence Ford and John J. Schumann, Jr., former President and Chairman of GMAC, died peacefully on December 8, 2011. He was 90 years old. He attended public schools and Montclair Academy before attending Governor Dummer Academy in the class of 1940. He received his B. A. degree from Wesleyan University in 1944 and later an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. After working for United Airlines and two Buick dealerships, he obtained his own dealership in Binghamton, NY, known as Schumann Buick in 1949, later known as Schumann-Van Atta Buick. He served on the Board of Columbia Mutual Life Insurance for many years and also on the Advisory Board of the Lincoln-First Bank. A fifty-year resident of Binghamton, he was involved with many charities including Broome County United Way as President and Vice Chair of Campaigns. He served on the Advisory Board of Lourdes Hospital, was the first President of the Broome County Zoological Society, was on the Board of Roberson Museum of Arts and Science, and also on the Roberson Foundation Board. He spent every summer of his life and the last 10 years at his family's home in Madison, Connecticut. In Connecticut he served on the Board of the Florence Griswold Museum and Bob was one of the early supporters and members of the citizens' group that formed in 2001, which over nine years crusaded successfully to protect the land of the old Griswold airport in Madison from development. A passionate birder from childhood, Schumann spent many hours in quiet observation of birds, their habits and their habitats, and especially loved their songs. He served for many years on the Boards of the National Audubon Society and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. He served on the board and was President of the Schumann Foundation, headquartered in Montclair, NJ, which was created by his parents in 1962. It is now known as The Schumann Media Center and is headed by Bill Moyers. In honor of his length of service, the Foundation established a Chair at Wesleyan University known as The Robert Schumann Environmental Studies Program. He is survived by his wife Marilyn Hotchkiss Schumann and their combined families, to whom he was a loving husband, father and grandfather: their sons Robert Ford Schumann, Jr., David Dickinson Schumann, and Edgar James Hotchkiss, and their daughters Mary James Schumann Hurley, Lola Ford Schumann, Carol Hotchkiss Potts, Linda Hotchkiss, and Barbara Hotchkiss. He is also survived by seven grandchildren: Timothy Chad Hotchkiss, Brook Schumann, Robin Ford Schumann, Tague Webster Hurley, Robert Ford Hurley, Eliza Hope Hotchkiss-Yager and Judah Briggs Thissell, and two great-granddaughters; and by his brother Ward Ford Schumann, of Aspen, Colorado. He leaves behind many friends and admirers who will forever miss his kindness and generosity, and his standards of commitment to the values he strongly believed in.

The recent release of the well-received ''Senna'' documentary has generated increased interest and perhaps provided the impetus for the re-release of ''Memories of Senna'' by Christopher Hilton. The book, first published in 2003, is essentially an oral history of Senna's career, culled from 120 people who knew him and raced against him. Their voices piece together a mosaic that's enjoyable for its nuance. There are plenty of boilerplate recollections of Senna's talent, religious faith, intellect and professionalism (during an age of the playboy racecar driver). But Senna's singular skill, as identified by race engineers and teammates, was his superior concentration and memory."

Yates the same way the Broncos have thrived during the Tim Tebow experiment and the 49ers have made peace with the Alex Smith enigma: they avoid turnovers, pass judiciously if not always successfully and treat punts as opportunities for the defense, not as failures. It is not optimal football strategy, but it is better than going into denial like the Colts, the Bears and the Eagles, who pretend everything is status quo while backup quarterbacks stagger beneath oversized expectations. Risk-averse investments make great short-term strategies, and with the Texans poised to win their first division title with a victory and a Titans loss, their conservative offense will pay all of the dividends they really need. Pick: Texans"

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"''Definitive'' is an ambitious goal, but one this hefty book tackles with élan -- perhaps the way a 1965 Gordon-Keeble might tackle a winding country road. I'd never heard of a Gordon-Keeble until I picked up ''Car,'' but there it is, parked among the hundreds of automobiles, both well loved and obscure, in this volume. They range from the primitive Grenville Steam Carriage of 1880 to the futuristic Alfa Romeo/Bertone Pandion of 2010, and readers will be hard-pressed to think of a make or model that isn't here, or at least represented by a close relative."
2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"As a travel writer for a luxury magazine, I get to sleep in exotic locations on top of memory-foam mattresses with 800-thread-count sheets. It is a major indulgence, since for most of my childhood and my early teens, I slept on the floor on wet sheets and a rubber mat. I grew up in the 1980s in a town called Garividi, on the eastern coast of India. Garividi was slightly more advanced than a village because it had an iron ore factory, but it didn't have pharmacies selling Pull-Ups or doctors providing medication for chronic bed-wetters like me. And so, four to five nights a week, until high school, I woke up with a wet blanket under me and guilt over my head."

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"FOR more than a decade, Autumn de Wilde has been one of indie rock's go-to portraitists. ''The people who didn't love being photographed -- word got around that I made it easier on them,'' said Ms. de Wilde, a Los Angeles photographer who has captured more unlikely stars than the Hubble Space Telescope, including Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie and the Decemberists. Her photographs and music videos don't sport an identifying visual stamp so much as a disquieting intimacy. They also tend to avoid two clichés of music portraiture: cool detachment and oddball energy. That much, at least, is evident in Ms. de Wilde's portraits of the art-pop chameleon Beck Hansen, which are collected in her latest book, ''Beck'' (Chronicle, $35). The volume stretches across their 16-year friendship. One reason Beck, above, is such a successful subject, Ms. de Wilde said, is his ability to darken playful scenarios with a touch of menace, like Bill Murray. And her own success? ''I'm able to make things colorful without making them sickeningly sweet.'' JONATHAN L. FISCHER"

''It may have been the first boutique hotel in London,'' he said, recalling that the front-desk man in the Nico era wore a cropped Vivienne Westwood top with feather trim. To me, the Portobello, in Notting Hill, is actually the un-boutique hotel. It doesn't charge for Wi-Fi, and you can get porridge any time you want it. Somebody in the management thought to add a small carton of milk to the familiar bottles in the mini bar (with a cereal bowl in the cupboard). In other words, the hotel gives you exactly what you need, and doesn't try to be stylish or hip. It just is."

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"DUNN--Patricia C.,Climbed from an entry-level position as a secretarial assistant to become the Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-based Barclays Global Investors (BGI) as it developed into the world's largest institutional money manager and subsequently served as the Non-Executive Chairman of the largest information technology company in the world, died on Sunday morning December 4th at her home in Orinda, CA. She was 58. The cause was ovarian cancer, according to William Jahnke, her husband of 30 years. Dunn was diagnosed with three different types of cancer over a three-year span starting in 2002, but remained active in various philanthropic causes until recently. Dunn's ascent in the investment and information technology worlds was remarkable; academically all she had was a degree in journalism from the University of California, Berkeley - no degree in business, economics, finance, engineering, or any other hard science. Her success in the professional and private life was due in part to her generous and gracious manner, her personal magnetism and the respectful manner in which she conducted her life. In 2006 Dunn found herself at the center of a media firestorm regarding an investigation by Hewlett-Packard to find the source of leaks to the press. Although the company later acknowledged she did not authorize, direct, or conduct the investigation she was asked to resign from the board because her continued presence had become a distraction given the attention to the matter by the media. Dunn graciously complied mounting an aggressive defense, which included testifying on Capitol Hill and, after being charged with four felonies, an appearance on 60 Minutes. All charges were later dropped in ""the interest of justice"" by a California Superior Court Judge before a scheduled preliminary hearing was held. Not only was the case against Dunn weak, there was evidence Dunn had been scapegoated. Dunn, a national merit scholar, attended the University of Oregon. She transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1975 with a degree in journalism. After being name CEO of Barclay's Global Advisors in 1998 she debuted at No. 11 on Fortune magazine's annual list of the most powerful women in business. At the height of media attention to the HP leak investigation story, the Bay Area Business Counsel inducted Dunn into its Hall of Fame for her contributions to the business community and philanthropic causes. At the time Dunn was the youngest recipient of the award and the only woman to be individually inducted in the Council's 64-year history. Dunn, who was legendarily even-tempered, collaborative and focused in her business dealings, was equally tenacious as a cancer patient. By some accounts, she underwent more chemotherapy at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center than anyone else in the institution's history, outliving the three-year life expectancy for her type of ovarian cancer by nearly five years. Dunn and her husband endowed a chair at UCSF's Department of Surgery and also funded clinical trials of an ovarian cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania in which, in some cases, she participated. Besides her husband Bill Jahnke, who is a former chief executive of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Dunn is survived by two daughters, Janai Brengman and Michelle Cox, a son, Michael Jahnke, and ten grandchildren, as well as a brother, Paul Dunn, and a sister, Debbie Lammers and her husband Chris, along with their children Paul Dunn, Jr. and Laura, Stephen and Kelly Lammers.

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"From tribesmen to billionaire philanthropists, the social value of generosity is already well known. But new research suggests it also matters much more intimately than we imagined, even down to our most personal relationships. Researchers from the University of Virginia's National Marriage Project recently studied the role of generosity in the marriages of 2,870 men and women. Generosity was defined as ''the virtue of giving good things to one's spouse freely and abundantly'' -- like simply making them coffee in the morning -- and researchers quizzed men and women on how often they behaved generously toward their partners. How often did they express affection? How willing were they to forgive?"

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"Stevens Pass, a snow-smothered ski area 78 miles east of Seattle that is beloved by Northwesterners, was sold last month. It wasn't big news, unless you noticed the buyer: CNL Lifestyle Properties. Stevens Pass is the 17th ski resort in which CNL Lifestyle Properties has full ownership or is a major investor. This Orlando-based company has in the last decade quietly surpassed the giants Vail Resorts and Intrawest to become the largest owner of ski resorts in the nation. Often, CNL buys the properties and then leases them back to the former owners. Its resorts include marquee names like Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado, Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine and Northstar California and Sierra at Tahoe in California. Last year nearly one in 10 visits to ski areas nationwide was to a CNL Lifestyle Properties mountain."

Some of these ventures succeeded, and some, like Tucker's, ultimately failed."

The Sablich brothers will provide fantasy football advice throughout the season on this blog and on Twitter (@5thDownFantasy). At the risk of being struck down from the heavens, we're here to say that we're down on Tim Tebow (DEN vs. Chicago) in Week 14. One reason is that Tebow's legs might not be able to save him against the Bears' sixth-ranked run defense. Chicago has held opposing teams' ground games to just under 100 yards a game this season. The Bears' pass defense is also better than you might think. If you take away the major beat-downs from Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees and Cam Newton this season, the Bears are coughing up just 12 fantasy points on average to opposing quarterbacks. Thus, Tebow is among our unfavorable matchup picks for Week 14."

He grew up in Clifton, NJ, graduated from Montclair Academy in 1940, and was a member of the Harvard College Class of 1944, graduating in 1946 after a WWII tour of domestic duty in the United States Army. He married Josephine Batchelder in 1947 and their sons John Arthur Jr. and Paul Batchelder were born in 1949 and 1953. John's entire working career was spent managing the family textile business in Paterson, NJ, keeping it alive and prosperous long after much of the American textile industry had either failed or moved offshore. He and his wife raised the family in Montclair, NJ. He was a champion skeet shooter, a middle handicap golfer at the Montclair Golf Club, a skilled poker player, an opera lover, a voracious reader, and, led by his wife, a frequent European traveler. More importantly, he was a loving and dedicated - and beloved - husband, father, and friend. He was particularly active with and loyal to Harvard, president of various alumni organizations, interviewing applicants and recruiting athletes for decades, and following Harvard athletics. He was happy and proud that his sons and granddaughter, Jessica, were able to follow in his Harvard footsteps. John was predeceased by his grandson, Willy, in 1996 and by his wife of 54 years, Jo, in 2001. He is survived by his sons and daughters-in-law, John and Deborah and Paul and Anne Hays, his grandchildren, Jessica (Orthman), Trent, Joshua and Matthew, his brother-in-law, Harry Batchelder, his dear friend, Elizabeth Wolf, and by innumerable friends and former colleagues. John Cosentino was a wonderful man. We'll have a small, private celebration of his life in the near future and he will be in our hearts forever."

2011-12-11T00:00:00Z,"So many books have been written about the Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Camaro that devoted readers may wonder if the same information is being exhumed over and over. In the case of two new books on these well-covered subjects, it turns out that readers are, in fact, being presented repackaged material. In ''Camaro: Five Generations of Performance,'' Darwin Holmstrom is updating his 2007 book that covered the Camaro's first four generations. Mr. Holmstrom's writing is heavily weighted toward the Camaro's early years. Camaros of the 1960s, for instance, get nearly half of the 348 pages, while the fifth generation gets barely 15 pages, many of them devoted to really large photographs. (For a more comprehensive treatment of the fifth-gen car, Tom Peters, Camaro's design chief, recommends Larry Edsall's ''Camaro: A Legend Reborn,'' published by Motorbooks in 2009.)"

In the course of the semester my students have learned how to read religion clause cases against the background of long-standing debates in philosophy and theology about the relationship between religious imperatives and the obligations of democratic citizenship. They have become adept at recognizing the arguments behind the arguments the justices are making explicitly. They can see how a case ostensibly about vouchers or school prayer or Christmas trees on courthouse steps is really about whether principle or history should inform a court's decisions. They can see how a case about head coverings or beards in the military (a topic that has surfaced once again) turns on the distinctions set down in John Locke's ""Letter Concerning Toleration"" (1689), a tract the justices may never have read. They can see how the majority and dissenting opinions in a free exercise case often reflect a tension between negative and positive liberty as these terms are defined by Isaiah Berlin, an author the justices will likely not have referenced. They can see how the entire history of religion-clause jurisprudence at once illustrates and is an extended critique of John Rawls's attempt in ""Political Liberalism"" to devise a form of government that will be fair to religion while at the same time keeping it at arm's length."

In hopes of getting a handle on this potentially threatening surge of information, the government has started a campaign that aims to quash what it calls ""rumors"" - statements that it says threaten the public order but that it has not bothered to define. After a series of public opinion disasters this past year, the Communist Party has been pressuring social media providers to weed out allegations it finds threatening, and state media have tried to whip up fear over their malignant social effects.The party's fever over rumors began in August, following the July 23 high-speed rail collision in Wenzhou. The government took a public opinion beating over the crash, in large part because social media harnessed anger over the bungled rescue effort, the safety of the high-speed rail network and corruption in the Railways Ministry. Once party leaders wrested back control of the story, they pushed all relevant facts into the darkness, leaving only rumors to sate the public's appetite for the truth. And this summer two other embarrassing public opinion defeats for China's leadership originally took off on the Internet: the Guo Meimei affair, which exposed irregularities at the government-run Red Cross Society of China, and the massive and well-organized public demonstrations against a chemical project in Dalian."

They had fled the pogroms in the shtetl Sobilivka, where previously the great excitement, as Sholem Aleichem recounted, was waiting for the daily train to arrive. They settled in Philadelphia, where the Portnoy girls, listed on the ship's manifest as Esther, Anne, and Feiga, grew up as Freda, Anna, and Fay. Their fourth sister, Shirley, was born here. Herman sold newspapers, cigars and Tootsie Rolls from a stand in a Center City office building, where Eva peddled goods floor to floor from a basket. School was their daughters' babysitter; Fay started Kindergarten while still only three years old. You had to be six to go, but the teachers knew the circumstances, Freda, the oldest, later recalled. Fay went to Kindergarten for a long time, on account of that! Freda married Manuel Fives, Anna married Al Roseman, Fay married Sidney Rosenfeld, and Shirley married Irv Zuckerman. The four sisters had 10 children, and scores of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We are engineers, doctors, educators, photographers, communicators, business owners, investors, and salesmen, spread across the United States. We would not be here but for the courage of the Portnoy family, who came to America as strangers in a strange land and made it their home."

2011-12-12T00:00:00Z,"The Champagne was flat: ''New Year's Eve'' was No. 1 at North American theaters over the weekend with about $13.7 million in ticket sales. But it failed to meet the prerelease estimates of analysts, who had anticipated sales of over $20 million. Warner Brothers had hoped that this romantic comedy, which cost about $55 million to produce and tens of millions more to market, would soar on the backs of its star-speckled cast; a similar endeavor last year, ''Valentine's Day,'' was a global hit. But that movie featured stars like Julia Roberts and Jamie Foxx. ''New Year's Eve'' included actors better known for TV -- Ashton Kutcher, Lea Michele, Sofia Vergara -- and some whose careers appear to be ice cold (Hilary Swank, Halle Berry)."
2011-12-12T00:00:00Z,"In its final week of repertory in America, the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, dancing six works in three programs at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from Wednesday to Saturday, kept hitting high after high. The highs kept extending our sense both of these dancers, an exceptionally attractive, diverse and skilled group, and of Cunningham himself. On Friday and Saturday the triple bill included ''Pond Way'' (1998), ''RainForest'' (1968) and ''Split Sides'' (2003). At each performance, toward the end of ''Split Sides,'' gasps attended an extraordinary solo danced by Silas Riener. As this marvel of both tautness and pliancy moved from position to position, often while changing balance on one leg, he must have done 15 successive acts that were physically astonishing and 50 that went beyond any choreographic precedent. Much of ''Split Sides'' is about maintaining equilibrium while the body is tilting one way or another: this solo takes that challenge to new virtuoso extremes, phenomenal in terms of sheer gymnastics as well as rhythm, shape and linear complexity."

He grew up in Clifton, NJ, graduated from Montclair Academy in 1940, and was a member of the Harvard College Class of 1944, graduating in 1946 after a WWII tour of domestic duty in the United States Army. He married Josephine Batchelder in 1947 and their sons John Arthur Jr. and Paul Batchelder were born in 1949 and 1953.

He and his wife raised the family in Montclair, NJ. He was a champion skeet shooter, a middle handicap golfer at the Montclair Golf Club, a skilled poker player, an opera lover, a voracious reader, and, led by his wife, a frequent European traveler. More importantly, he was a loving and dedicated - and beloved - husband, father, and friend. He was particularly active with and loyal to Harvard, president of various alumni organizations, interviewing applicants and recruiting athletes for decades, and following Harvard athletics. He was happy and proud that his sons and granddaughter, Jessica, were able to follow in his Harvard footsteps. John was predeceased by his grandson, Willy, in 1996 and by his wife of 54 years, Jo, in 2001.

In ""Kempinski (2007),"" which was on view last year at the New Museum, Beloufa uses a simple tweak in tense to build an eerie alternate reality. Shot at night in Mali, ""Kempinski"" features interviews with local inhabitants in rural settings - in a crowd of oxen, in bushes, in dusty courtyards - who speak about things from telepathic communication with stars, animals and machines to teleportation via light and sound, as if they were present-day realities. The scenes are lit by handheld, corded fluorescent lights that could, if you squint, be mistaken for alien technology, and the subjects' assertions register as farcical deadpan: Beloufa's tone of choice. The narration plays on a viewer's superficial ideas of where primitive magic and futuristic science might meet, hinging on that rhetorical switch from ""will be"" to ""is."""

Trip Gabriel's writeup for the Times does a good job of capturing the droning deadliness of the affair, the painful seminar-room quality, the absence any spark in the candidates's answers to the exquisitely-polite questions. (""After an hour and a half, when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined, the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief."") If Gingrich made good on his pledge to teach an online class while in the Oval Office, I imagine that it would turn out something like this. And if Huntsman's supporters want to know why their man has struggled to inspire any excitement or strong support, despite an impressive record and solid conservative bona fides, the answer begins with the fact that he just spent 90 minutes on a stage with the candidate leading in the polls and never once said anything that might actually make some real news for his own struggling campaign.

Oscars awarded in recent decades must be returned to the Academy rather than sold on the open market, but older statuettes are generally not subject to the restriction.

They settled in Philadelphia, where the Portnoy girls, listed on the ship's manifest as Esther, Anne, and Feiga, grew up as Freda, Anna, and Fay. Their fourth sister, Shirley, was born here. Herman sold newspapers, cigars and Tootsie Rolls from a stand in a Center City office building, where Eva peddled goods floor to floor from a basket. School was their daughters' babysitter; Fay started Kindergarten while still only three years old. You had to be six to go, but the teachers knew the circumstances, Freda, the oldest, later recalled. Fay went to Kindergarten for a long time, on account of that! Freda married Manuel Fives, Anna married Al Roseman, Fay married Sidney Rosenfeld, and Shirley married Irv Zuckerman.

He married Josephine Batchelder in 1947 and their sons John Arthur Jr. and Paul Batchelder were born in 1949 and 1953. John's entire working career was spent managing the family textile business in Paterson, NJ, keeping it alive and prosperous long after much of the American textile industry had either failed or moved offshore. He and his wife raised the family in Montclair, NJ. He was a champion skeet shooter, a middle handicap golfer at the Montclair Golf Club, a skilled poker player, an opera lover, a voracious reader, and, led by his wife, a frequent European traveler. More importantly, he was a loving and dedicated - and beloved - husband, father, and friend. He was particularly active with and loyal to Harvard, president of various alumni organizations, interviewing applicants and recruiting athletes for decades, and following Harvard athletics. He was happy and proud that his sons and granddaughter, Jessica, were able to follow in his Harvard footsteps. John was predeceased by his grandson, Willy, in 1996 and by his wife of 54 years, Jo, in 2001.

Because the entrepreneurs, Beth Heller and Tamara Quinn, linked their yoga business to referrals from Fertility Centers of Illinois, from which they subleased quarters in a rented building on the Chicago River, they temporarily relocated their business while the similarly displaced fertility clinic reconfigured and rebuilt the first floor offices after the July 2010 flood. This past July, the water damage from the second flood was not as severe. The company was able to stay open during the repairs, which required cutting out the bottom foot of some walls and bringing in industrial blowers.

Customers who then purchased the same item from Amazon received a 5 percent discount, up to $5. (The deal was available only from Friday night through Saturday, and only for certain kinds of products.) For its initiative, Amazon has been greeted with a barrage of rotten tomatoes, from the press and from small businesses and their sympathizers. (Gawker, for one, described it as ''a Christmas attack on local shops'' and a ''cheap, sad thing.'') On Thursday, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, the top Republican on the Small Business Committee, joined the fray. ''Incentivizing consumers to spy on local shops is a bridge too far,'' she said in a statement.

Here are his seven tips to get that shot of your family lit by hearth, menorah or blinking Christmas tree lights. Get more stops. ''The easiest way is to get a very bright lens,'' said Mr. Laforet, meaning using a lens that lets in a lot of light, which is described by an ''f'' number. It's counterintuitive, but the lower the number, the more light a lens lets in. He said to look for at least an f 2.0, but if you can afford it, get an f 1.2. The hitch is that the faster the lens the more it costs. To go from an f 1.8 50mm lens to an f 1.4 lens almost doubles the price. ''Those lenses tend to be more expensive, but they get some great images,'' he said."

The popularity of marijuana, which is now more prevalent among 10th graders than cigarette smoking, reflects what researchers and drug officials say is a growing perception among teenagers that habitual marijuana use carries little risk of harm. That perception, experts say, is fueled in part by wider familiarity with medicinal marijuana and greater ease in obtaining it."

For the magazine's cover story this week, Jonathan Mahler went there to investigate the city's plan to revive itself with a publicly subsidized golf course and luxury-housing development in the very place where factories once provided thousands of blue-collar workers with a way of life. Slowly, since the 1960s, Benton Harbor has lost all its factories and half its population; those who remain subsist on a per capita income of $10,000. The city's finances are so wrecked that the state government sent in an emergency manager who answers to no one locally. Putting a golf course in the midst of all this is, as Jon observes, ""almost a caricature of economic disparity."""

One of the producers, Thomas Viertel, said in an interview that the libretto has been ''totally rewritten to emphasize different plotlines and different relationships'' - chiefly, strengthening a romantic subplot between the main character Alex, the working-class welder who dreams of becoming a dancer (and who was played by Jennifer Beals in the movie), and Nick, a wealthy young man whose family owns the steel plant."

2011-12-16T00:00:00Z,"It's the dream of every art collector to buy a painting from a little-known artist for $100 and later sell it for $1 million. But how does that artist feel? Some think it unfair that artists typically do not directly benefit when a particular work escalates in value, and a bill introduced Thursday by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, and Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, seeks to redress that. With the support of organizations like the Visual Artists and Galleries Association and the Artists Rights Society, the lawmakers propose setting aside 7 percent of the price of artworks that are resold for more than $10,000 at auction houses. Half of the commission would go to the artist and the other half to nonprofit art museums. The legislation, which would apply only to the resale of work, models itself on laws - more commonly known as droit de suite - already on the books in dozens of countries. The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works also provides for a resale royalty. Previous attempts to enact a national royalty resale law have failed. At the moment, California is the only state that requires resellers to pay royalties to the artist. This fall, three class-action suits were brought by artists against Sotheby's, Christie's and the online auction site eBay for failure to pay royalties under the California law. The auction houses, as well as museums and galleries, have traditionally opposed the idea of resale royalties, calling it a tax that increases the cost of doing business. Mr. Nadler said that ''visual artists deserve a share in the sales and resales of their creative works.''"

She was predeceased by her brother Dr. Robin Caird Watson of New York, NY, but is survived by her husband Dr. Gerald F. Whalen of Shrewsbury, NJ, and by her four children: Dr. Giles F. Whalen of Sutton, MA, Daniel W. Whalen of Rumson, NJ, Sarah V. Robinson of South Salem, NY and Philippa C. Burke of New York, NY. She is also survived by nine grandchildren. She was born December 3, 1925, the first child of Eleanor Lloyd Watson and William Watson in London, England, and was raised there with her younger brother, Robin. She graduated as a physician from the University of Aberdeen and at the age of 21 returned to London as a pediatric specialist at the Great Ormand Street Childrens Hospital. While there she met a visiting American neurosurgeon, Gerald Whalen, who swept her off her feet. They were married on May 9, 1953 in the chapel of Portuguese embassy in London and sailed for New York later that year. The couple settled in Shrewsbury where Elizabeth raised her children and made her home for 56 years. Her genuine warmth drew people to her naturally and her life was devoted to family and friends. She delighted in the things that make life joyous but was a steadying, ethical influence for all around her and always someone to turn to for wisdom and perspective. She loved learning, children, gardening, friends, travel, china, holidays, cooking and family dinners. She had a generous spirit, saw the good in all people and was a living example of human decency. She made her home a place of grace and light that was both refuge and beacon. Although her spirit still shines brightly for those who loved her, her illness had dimmed her presence for too long. She has been much missed, was much loved, and will long be remembered. A memorial service will be held on January 7, 2012 at Christ Church in Shrewsbury, NJ at 11am.

The installation, called ''Meeting Room,'' would involve building three low-walled structures within the roughly one-acre space of the square, each to be made from salvaged local stone and intended to suggest the foundations of vanished centuries-old buildings that can still be found throughout New England.

Jason Garrett's late-game over-complications have become the stuff of legend, but let's listen in on Raheem Morris's clock-management dissertation after the Buccaneers' loss to the Titans a few weeks ago: ''We spike the ball after every first down you get. You pick up a first down, you have to go spike it, you have no timeouts left. Every first down after that point has got to be a spiked ball.'' Somewhere, Herm Edwards, and only Herm Edwards, is nodding in approval. Clock-management issues have become increasingly moot during the Buccaneers' seven-game losing streak as 37-9 and 41-14 losses have piled up. Josh Freeman has been battling both inconsistency and shoulder and finger injuries, and the Buccaneers' defense often caves in at the red zone, having allowed 14 touchdowns in their opponents' last 17 trips inside the 20. With Freeman spraying passes and the Bucs waving opponents into the end zone like parking lot attendants, Garrett can enjoy a consequence-free last-second timeout spree if he chooses. Pick: Cowboys"

Not that that makes a good constructor; hitting for the cycle is not really any more important than producing a puzzle that happens to be a pangram.

2011-12-18T13:07:29Z,"Bells are ringing in Hollywood, but they're not the Christmas kind. Two big sequels, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,"" delivered shaky results over the weekend, alarming studios about a continued downturn at the North American box office. ""A Game of Shadows"" (Warner Brothers) was No. 1 with about $40 million in ticket sales. Analysts had expected that film, which cost $125 million to make, to take in over $50 million; the first installment in this franchise opened with $62 million in 2009. ""Chipwrecked"" (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $23.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. That result was 52 percent below the opening weekend total for the last Chipmunks movie in 2009. ""Chip-Wrecked"" cost an estimated $80 million to make. A variety of factors could have dented interest: sequel fatigue, family film overload, higher ticket prices, a lack of overall momentum at the box office. Elsewhere, Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" (Paramount) was a powerful third, taking in about $13 million in limited release on 425 Imax screens. That result set an Imax record and positioned ""Ghost Protocol"" as a potential blockbuster and career rebound for Mr. Cruise as it expands nationwide on Wednesday. ""New Year's Eve"" (Warner) was fourth with about $7.4 million in ticket sales, lifting its two-week total to $24.8 million. ""The Sitter"" (Fox) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4.4 million for a two-week total of $17.7 million."

Overpursuing will be punished, and the Giants must contain Helu if they hope to keep him from continuing his streak of three games with 100 or more yards.

Myanmar has been under military rule in one form or another since 1962, but since the elections, tourists have begun to trickle in, eager to be among the first few to explore the country as it opens. ''The country is a traveler's paradise with all the treasures of Southeast Asia but without all the tourists,'' Mr. Mott wrote. ''For the early riser, novice monks with their saffron robes are there to see, in perfect composition for a photographer. Wherever you go you will rarely have a smile unreturned.

Known as Dud, he was a leading ophthalmologist as well as a true renaissance man, who loved literature and the arts as much as medicine and science. Born in New York City, he earned masters and medical degrees from Emory University. Dud served two years in the Army during World War II and achieved the rank of Captain. He did his residency at New York University Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital, ultimately becoming the Kirby Professor and Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology in 1959, a position he would hold until 2000, and remained a full professor until 2006. Dud not only trained generations of future ophthalmologists and undertook and supported significant medical research, but also became a world-famous surgeon specializing in diseases of the eye muscle. Dud was a leader of many medical organizations, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Board of Ophthalmology; authored or co-authored several books and over 100 articles in his field; and received numerous awards, including the American Medical Association Knapp Medal for Contributions to Ophthalmology and the Emory Medal, the highest distinction conferred by Emory University. Dud was a member of the Century Association in New York City, and the Cosmos Club in Washington, DC. He was married for 58 years to the late Rose-Helen Breinin, an art historian.

He was born in Beverly, MA to Sterlyn R. and A. Louise (Smith) Morgan. His lifelong fascination with all forms of classical music was sparked by the fact that both his father and grandfather were musicians. Entering Columbia College in 1956 proved a transforming experience through all the college and New York offered. Mr. Morgan taught social studies in the City's junior high school system for over thirty years, learning from his students as he taught them. Upon his retirement, he pursued his interest in painting, primarily at the National Academy Museum and School under Ms. Michele Licalsi and the Art Student League, most recently with Mr. William Scharf. He also enjoyed a long association with the Ward-Nasse Gallery on Prince Street. An avid traveler, he covered many miles in forty eight states and six continents, missing only Australia. An engaging person with wide ranging interests, he was blessed with many circles of friends. Mr. Morgan is survived by two sisters - Nancy Morgan of Danvers, MA (currently here), and Faye (Morgan) Rees of Halfmoon, NY - and a cousin Robert Smith of Ipswich, MA.

Rather than being tucked away, the kitchen is out in the open and cradled by a bar where people eat, drink and watch every culinary move. ''We think that in a normal restaurant setting, the chef plays such a removed role from experience of the diner,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''Our relationship with the person eating doesn't stop when we are done plating the food.'' The two greet the guests and cook and serve artful dishes like pressed duck leg coupled with savory granola and 72-hour slow-cooked wagyu beef dusted with a blackened kale ash.

''Ben Brantley is a great critic, always thoughtful, always able to put his finger on the one thing lacking that might have put a show over the top. But in this case Brantley's longing for the tragedy of a Judy Garland or Liza Minnelli is understandable but misguided. Their sadness resonated with audiences, particularly gay men, who could never be who they were in their time or place, the same sadness as the blues before the civil rights movement. Hugh Jackman's joy, and what resonates with audiences is, in fact, the opposite. Hugh Jackman could be gay -- it wouldn't matter. And that is what he is trying to say.''"

2011-12-18T00:00:00Z,"MOTHER MARY MAGDALENE had a dilemma. She had started a new Roman Catholic order, the Community of Compassion, in Fort Worth, and she needed something for the sisters to wear. ''You can't just go to the store and buy a habit,'' she said. ''Every order has to have a distinct one, and you're not supposed to copy anyone else.'' Not only that, many old habits (some of them gorgeous) have been lost forever when their order died out. Mother Mary's research led her to the Web site of Julia Sherman, a New York artist who had photographed the nun dolls at Cross in the Woods museum in Indian Wells, Mich.

2011-12-18T00:00:00Z,"Jason and Justin Sablich are here to help you with your fantasy football team. The Sablich brothers will provide fantasy football advice throughout the season on this blog and on Twitter (@5thDownFantasy). Cam Newton (CAR) vs. Houston - Newton, who went undrafted in most leagues, has surprisingly carried the many fantasy teams that were lucky enough to grab him off the waiver wire early this season. But just when you need him the most, if you're in one of the many leagues starting their fantasy playoffs this week, he gets his toughest matchup (statistically) of the season in Week 15. The Texans stop the run and pass almost equally well, ranking fourth in the league against the ground game and third against the pass. No quarterback has posted more than 20 fantasy points on them since Drew Brees back in Week 3."

2011-12-18T00:00:00Z,"FUR is a much more common sight in Russia than it is in the United States -- clearly, groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals haven't been able to make as many inroads. In December, ads for fur shows can be seen throughout Moscow. A typical mink coat sells for $3,000, while a sable coat can go for around $30,000. Some of the coats are made in Russia, but many brands have moved production to countries like China, where labor is cheaper. Regardless of their coats' source, Russians have shown little sign of loosening their hold on a fashion born of harsh weather and long tradition."

On weekends, thousands of them -- as well as motorcycles and pickups and pretty much anything with wheels -- descend on this barren stretch 150 miles east of San Diego. Glamis has been a mecca for sand racing since the 1950s. But these are not the dune buggies of ''Scooby-Doo.'' These vehicles -- some of them customized at a cost of $200,000 -- can go 120 m.p.h. The weekend after Thanksgiving is traditionally one of the most popular; this year, 142,000 people showed up: professional drivers, thrill-seekers, families watching the races and deep-frying turkeys under giant umbrellas. There's no prize money, and no one is really in charge. After sundown, things tend to get a little debauched, according to Phil Pendergist, a Glamis regular.

Wilson, 86, died Tuesday, November 29 at his home in Princeton, NJ, from a stroke following years of struggle with Alzheimer's Disease. Wilson was born in Montclair, NJ in 1925, and graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1943. He enlisted in the US Army Air Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant as a B-17 navigator. After graduating from Yale in 1949, he started at Life Magazine as a reporter working in New York and Detroit, then became a foreign correspondent, covering the Korean War and French Indochina War. In 1956 he was named Life's Washington bureau chief. Wilson joined John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960, and was appointed deputy director of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1961. He was the last surviving member of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (ExCOMM), a specially-created policy group that advised President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Wilson advocated releasing reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile sites being built in Cuba, secretly taken by an American U-2 spy plane. Publication of the classified photos was approved by ExCOMM and credited with turning the tide of British press opinion decisively in favor of the US. He left USIA in 1965 to became general manager of Time-Life International. In 1968, Wilson worked briefly on Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, and in 1970 was named Time Inc. Corporate Vice President for Public Affairs, from which he tired in 1989. In 1987, Wilson and former Time magazine business editor George Taber, launched NJBIZ, a paper covering business in New Jersey. NJBIZ was acquired in 2005 by Journal Publications Inc. of Harrisburg, PA. After Communism's collapse in the Soviet Union and its client countries, Wilson and James L. Greenfield co-founded the Independent Journalism Foundation in 1991, which operates training programs for journalists in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. Wilson is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Susan M. Neuberger, a son, Dwight M. Wilson of Berkeley, CA, two daughters, Katherine L. Wilson of Newton, MA, and Penelope Wilson of The Bronx, NY, and five grandchildren. A Service of Remembrance will be held on Saturday, January 28, 2012 at the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville in Lawrenceville, NJ. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Donald M. Wilson Fellowship, of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, in Washington, D.C."

2011-12-18T00:00:00Z,"HART--Suzanne Louise, 41, was killed in an elevator accident on Wednesday, December 14, 2011 in New York, New York. Suzanne was born on August 25, 1970, in Columbus, Ohio. She grew up in Central Ohio, suburban Chicago, and Palos Verdes Estates, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Suzanne graduated from Palos Verdes High School and earned a degree in Fine Art and International Relations from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Suzanne began her career as a printmaker in SoHo and entered the advertising business as a graphic artist. She proved to be a quick study and found that she had a strong affinity for leading teams, developing ad concepts and campaigns, and pitching them to clients and prospects. Suzanne was a natural connector of people, both personally and professionally, and she derived great satisfaction from bringing together people from very different disciplines and backgrounds to create something that none of them could have created on their own. She was a tireless and dedicated worker, and she maintained her cheerful disposition, optimistic outlook, and playful sense of humor in even the most stressful of times. Suzanne was equally energetic outside of the office. She was particularly interested in landscape architecture and design, and she recently completed a two year landscape design program through the New York Botanical Garden in her spare time. She was particularly proud of the work she did in the backyard of the Brooklyn Heights home she shared with Christian Dickson, an associate with Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA) in New York. In addition to Chris, the love of her life, Suzanne also leaves behind a large and loving family: her father, Alex W.

Hart of Chappaqua, New York; brother Gregory Edward Hart and his girlfriend Tara Cadenelli of Portland, Oregon; and stepsister Kiersten Wolf Petrucci, her husband Andrew Petrucci, and their son Collin Petrucci of Alexandria, Virginia. Suzanne was preceded in death by her mother, Fyanne Edwards Hart, in 1992, and, despite her young age, became the glue that held the family together for the past 19 years. Like her mother before her, Suzanne had a genuine affection for people that led to the development of a wide circle of friends. And despite growing up in the Midwest and on the West Coast, she loved New York and the friends and colleagues she became close to during the last 15 years of her tragically shortened life. Suzanne was a ray of sunshine wherever she went, and though she has left us in body, her spirit will live on through the many people she loved and who loved her so deeply. A memorial service celebrating Suzanne's life will be held on Monday, December 19th, 2011, at 10:30am eastern standard time, at 300 Madison Avenue in New York City. Please enter through the private entrance at Madison and 41st Street. A private burial will be held in her parent's hometown, Lancaster, Ohio, at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent to either the New York Botanical Society (www.nybg.org) or the Suzanne L. Hart Memorial Scholarship Fund at Knox College (please contact Beverly Holmes at bholmes@knox.edu or 309 341-7755 for more information)."

But I spend enough time in other people's cities to know that certain zones get tagged as tourist traps for a reason: they have attractions worth seeing. Such is the case in the heart of Manhattan. Midtown is so full of marketing come-ons and overpriced souvenirs that many New Yorkers try to avoid it entirely. (Yes, I like comedy, but no, I don't need to get asked as much by eight guys promoting clubs.) Being frugal in Midtown calls for more than a laundry list of $10 meals, strategies for cheap theater tickets, tricks to find affordable hotels and advice on discount passes (though those will help, too). It calls for a strategy."

2011-12-19T14:13:37Z,"The deaths of Vaclav Havel and Kim Jong Il within a 24-hour span are more than a reminder of the extremes of heroism and iniquity that coexist in human affairs. They're a reminder of how much successful political heroism depends, in the end, on the ability to prick the conscience of iniquity, and to remind even the worst regimes and most compromised authorities that there are moral absolutes which they transgress at their peril. The great success of the Velvet Revolution, like the successes of Gandhi and Mandela and Martin Luther King and so many other icons of peaceful revolution, was achieved by public argument as well as by public protest, and by the fact that the bureaucrats and apparatchiks and generals the revolutionaries were confronting weren't willing to take the most absolute and unthinkable steps to retain their privileges and defend their power. (In David Chappell's ""A Stone of Hope,"" a history of religion and the civil rights movement, there's a fascinating account of how this worked in the white South - the way that the Christian appeals of King and Ralph Abernathy and Co. persuaded many white Christians that they had a moral obligation to stand by and let the revolution happen, rather than defend Jim Crow to the end.) When civil disobedience works, it does so by reminding the inhumane of their inhumanity, and by finding the vulnerabilities in what seem like permanently hardened hearts. In this sense, there's a circular quality to any successful peaceful revolt: No De Klerk without Mandela but also no Mandela (as we know Mandela) without De Klerk; no Gorbachev without Sakharov and Walesa and Havel, but no Havel and Walesa (as we know them) without Gorbachev."

2011-12-19T00:00:00Z,"HART--Suzanne Louise, 41, was killed in an elevator accident on Wednesday, December 14, 2011 in New York, New York. Suzanne was born on August 25, 1970, in Columbus, Ohio. She grew up in Central Ohio, suburban Chicago, and Palos Verdes Estates, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Suzanne graduated from Palos Verdes High School and earned a degree in Fine Art and International Relations from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Suzanne began her career as a printmaker in SoHo and entered the advertising business as a graphic artist. She proved to be a quick study and found that she had a strong affinity for leading teams, developing ad concepts and campaigns, and pitching them to clients and prospects. Suzanne was a natural connector of people, both personally and professionally, and she derived great satisfaction from bringing together people from very different disciplines and backgrounds to create something that none of them could have created on their own. She was a tireless and dedicated worker, and she maintained her cheerful disposition, optimistic outlook, and playful sense of humor in even the most stressful of times. Suzanne was equally energetic outside of the office. She was particularly interested in landscape architecture and design, and she recently completed a two year landscape design program through the New York Botanical Garden in her spare time. She was particularly proud of the work she did in the backyard of the Brooklyn Heights home she shared with Christian Dickson, an associate with Robert A.M. Stern Architects (RAMSA) in New York. In addition to Chris, the love of her life, Suzanne also leaves behind a large and loving family: her father, Alex W. ""Pete"" Hart and stepmother Mary Templeton Hart, of Naples, FL; brother Alex Paul Hart, his wife Desiree Joy Hart, and their children Alex W. and Lauren Hart of Atlanta, Georgia; brother Michael Howard Hart, his wife Patti Zogheb Hart, and their children Hannah, Emma, and Michael G. Hart of Chappaqua, New York; brother Gregory Edward Hart and his girlfriend Tara Cadenelli of Portland, Oregon; and stepsister Kiersten Wolf Petrucci, her husband Andrew Petrucci, and their son Collin Petrucci of Alexandria, Virginia. Suzanne was preceded in death by her mother, Fyanne Edwards Hart, in 1992, and, despite her young age, became the glue that held the family together for the past 19 years. Like her mother before her, Suzanne had a genuine affection for people that led to the development of a wide circle of friends. And despite growing up in the Midwest and on the West Coast, she loved New York and the friends and colleagues she became close to during the last 15 years of her tragically shortened life. Suzanne was a ray of sunshine wherever she went, and though she has left us in body, her spirit will live on through the many people she loved and who loved her so deeply. A memorial service celebrating Suzanne's life will be held on Monday, December 19th, 2011, at 10:30am eastern standard time, at 300 Madison Avenue in New York City. Please enter through the private entrance at Madison and 41st Street. A private burial will be held in her parent's hometown, Lancaster, Ohio, at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent to either the New York Botanical Society (www.nybg.org) or the Suzanne L. Hart Memorial Scholarship Fund at Knox College (please contact Beverly Holmes at bholmes@knox.edu or 309 341-7755 for more information)."

2011-12-19T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13, 49) CHARLES & RAY EAMES: THE ARCHITECT AND THE PAINTER From the 1940s through the late '70s the Eameses, above -- he was trained as an architect; she was an artist -- ran a design studio in Venice, Calif., that made history. Best known for their beautiful, functional and inexpensive furniture, most notably their signature molded plywood ''Eames chair,'' the couple influenced movements in post-World War II American life, from the development of Modernism to the rise of the computer age. Their motto was ''the best for the least for the most,'' a representation of their utopian ideal of capitalist mass production. In this ''American Masters'' presentation Jason Cohn and Bill Jersey parse the lives of Charles and Ray Eames, not least their eccentricity, the loyalty they inspired in young designers, his infidelity and a partnership ultimately weakened by a loss of common creative purpose. ''All of which is to say that they were human, and the most gratifying thing about 'Eames' is that it shows, in marvelous detail, how their work was an extension of themselves and how their distinct personalities melded into a unique and protean force,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times when the documentary was released theatrically last month. ''The film is also appropriately busy and abundant: full of objects, information, stories and people, organized with hectic elegance.'' 11:15 A.M. (HBO Signature) GREENBERG (2010) Ben Stiller, left, plays Roger Greenberg, a 40-year-old former musician who, after a mental breakdown, house-sits in the large Los Angeles home of his vacationing brother in this film from Noah Baumbach. Greta Gerwig portrays Florence Marr, the brother's 25-year-old assistant and Roger's on-again, off-again love interest in his quest to recapture his youth. ''Mr. Stiller, suppressing his well-honed sketch comedian's urge to wink at the audience, turns Roger into a walking challenge to the Hollywood axiom that a movie's protagonist must be likable,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times. Only at the end does Mr. Baumbach reveal that the film has been ''a romantic comedy all along,'' he added. ''And suddenly a movie about a man who is defiantly difficult to like becomes very hard not to love.''"

2011-12-19T00:00:00Z,"Bells are ringing in Hollywood, but they're not the Christmas kind. Two big sequels, ''Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows'' and ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked,'' delivered shaky results over the weekend, alarming studios about a continued downturn at the North American box office. ''A Game of Shadows'' (Warner Brothers) was No. 1 with about $40 million in ticket sales. Analysts had expected that film, which cost $125 million to make, to take in over $50 million; the first installment in this franchise opened with $62 million in 2009. ''Chipwrecked'' (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $23.5 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. That result was 52 percent below the opening weekend total for the last Chipmunks movie in 2009. ''Chip-Wrecked'' cost an estimated $80 million to make. A variety of factors could have dented interest: sequel fatigue, family film overload, higher ticket prices, a lack of overall momentum at the box office. Elsewhere, Tom Cruise's ''Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol'' (Paramount) was a powerful third, taking in about $13 million in limited release on 425 Imax screens. That result set an Imax record and positioned ''Ghost Protocol'' as a potential blockbuster and career rebound for Mr. Cruise as it expands nationwide on Wednesday. ''New Year's Eve'' (Warner) was fourth with about $7.4 million in ticket sales, lifting its two-week total to $24.8 million. ''The Sitter'' (Fox) was fifth, taking in an estimated $4.4 million for a two-week total of $17.7 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

None of those conspiracy theorists explained why so many original users of the Fire put mixed to negative reviews on Amazon's own site. The uproar underlined yet again how people have deep-seated but contradictory feelings about their devices. In one sense, they demand a lot; in another, they are very forgiving. No one would put up with a new car that did not drive well, but people expect technology to be balky, at least in the beginning.

He was the beloved husband of the late Mary, father of David and Michael, and grandfather of Joshua, Alexander and Julian. He was born to Erna and Hermann van Biema in 1920 in Hannover, Germany. His parents sent him to live in safety with relatives in the U.S in 1936, and were able to join him only years later. He thrived in the face of this adversity, attaining an M.S. in chemical engineering at Purdue University, with the help of a scholarship from the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. He traveled frequently and with pleasure, including puddle-jumping to remote tapioca factories in Brazil for General Foods Corp. He went on to manage the import and export of fine chemicals for several firms. In 1951, Gerhard married Mary Epstein, his life partner and best friend for 49 years. Settling in Tenafly, NJ, he volunteered to improve public education, as a Board of Education member and President, and as leader of the Citizens Education Council. He loved his family, art and music, strolling out-doors, a spirited debate around the kitchen table, and the occasional bad pun. He was a wonderful, dedicated son, father, husband, and citizen; a wise and analytical advisor; and terrific company. He was quietly and deeply passionate about many things he believed in and cared about, including the country that took him in, and his grandchildren, who made his eyes light up through his last days.

2011-12-19T00:00:00Z,"From my seat on the aisle in the orchestra section at the Metropolitan Opera House I saw only one family get up and leave during the third act of Engelbert Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel'' at its season premiere on Friday night. That seemed noteworthy because onstage, in a kitchen filled with lost children baked into gingerbread, a frumpy, gluttonous witch was compelling a little girl to help fatten her brother for the oven, between unsubtle hints that the girl was destined for the same fate. Brrr. Grimm's fairy tales are hardly kids' stuff: a point that Humperdinck's buoyantly luscious music, Adelheid Wette's slightly softened libretto and David Pountney's quippy English translation don't disguise. Richard Jones, the director, cleverly based his imaginative 2007 production around the relatable notion of gnawing hunger; two acts set in kitchens frame a central scene set in a haunted forest that magically transforms into a whimsical dining room."

Welles received the Oscar in 1942 for his work on the script for ""Citizen Kane."" It was thought to be lost and later replaced. But eventually the original turned up in the hands of a cinematographer who said he had received it from Welles as a gift, and, after a court fight, it was turned over to Welles's daughter Beatrice.

The four days of sales at Christie's became the most valuable private jewelry sale in history ($137.2 million) and the most valuable private collection of fashion ever sold ($5.5 million). The first online-only Christie's sale drew 57,000 bids and reaped $9.5 million. The complete collection sold out, a testament to both the star's magnetism and the quality of the merchandise. All the proceeds benefit the Elizabeth Taylor Trust, which manages the Taylor estate.  Taylor was well-known in her later years for her fund-raising and activism for AIDS research. A portion of the profit generated by Christie's sale of exhibition tickets (58,000 people saw the exhibit in its international travels), event  sponsorship and the ongoing sales of ""select publications,"" will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. The auction house also raised $170,00 through the sale of a deluxe limited edition boxed set of the catalogs on the first evening of the auction, which will also go to the foundation.  Some highlights from the later sales: those Vuitton trunks, with the violet-colored tags reading ""Mine!"" sold for $245,500, the top figure for the accessories sale. The Andy Warhol lithograph signed and dedicated by the artist went for $662,000. A (quite hideous) beaded Versace bolero jacket featuring rhinestone images of Taylor in some of her famous roles fetched $128,500. Even rocks Taylor never actually wore went for big sums: a large gray ""scholar's rock"" netted $386,500, more than 30 times its estimate of $8,000 to $12,000. Christie's will complete the dispersal of the Taylor collections in the new year with sales of her Old Master paintings (Jan. 25 in New York), including a Frans Hals portrait (not of Taylor), and her Impressionist and modern art collection (London, Feb. 7 and 8). Chris Wilding, Taylor's son and a trustee of the foundation, said, ""My mother always acknowledged that she was merely the temporary custodian of the incredible things she owned. Today, I think she would be happy to know that her collections will continue to enrich the lives of those who have acquired pieces."""

Those songwriters, of course, were John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles, above. Now Mr. McCartney, at 69, says he is putting out an album of standards from his youth, calling them ''the songs which inspired the songs.'' The album also includes two original songs in the style of pre-rock standards. Mr. McCartney announced on Monday that he would release the new album on Feb. 7, saying it was time ''the songs me and John based quite a few of our things on'' received the attention they deserve. ''When I kind of got into songwriting, I realized how well structured these songs were, and I think I took a lot of my lessons from them,'' Mr. McCartney said in the announcement. The song list for the album has yet to be released. Mr. McCartney said it includes classic American compositions by songwriters like Cole Porter and Harold Arlen, many of which he heard his father, a jazz musician, play on the piano in their home. He said he recorded the songs over the last year at the Capitol studios in Los Angeles with Diana Krall and her band. He did the vocals himself but, for the first time in his long career, left all the instrumental work to others. Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder play on the two original songs, he said. JAMES C.

I knew I wanted it to be something special and seasonal, but the constraints posed by the party (it was held at the Center for Fiction, a lovely place, but one not equipped with a full bar or full kitchen) demanded that I keep it simple. Not a worry, as I'm inclined to keep it simple where cocktails are concerned. The classic rye Manhattan was my starting point. What if I replaced the sweet vermouth with ginger syrup? That worked fine, but something was missing. I was testing the drink in a friend's kitchen in New Hampshire over Thanksgiving weekend. A bowlful of clementines (one of my favorite winter treats) sat on the counter. Freshly squeezed clementine juice - and a generous dousing of Angostura bitters - brought the whole thing together. It's easy to make ginger syrup: I prepare a basic sugar-and-water simple syrup, in which I steep peeled, fresh ginger long enough that its strong, spicy bite really comes through. But you can skip this step altogether and buy the excellent ready-made ginger syrup from Brooklyn's Morris Kitchen. As a nod to the bitters and the clementine, I christened the drink the Bitter Darling. It was a hit. And even though I invented it especially for one party, I'm sure it'll be a mainstay of my winter-cocktail repertory."

To keep the good times from stopping, Dorian wishes to preserve his youthful looks forever, so he makes a deal with the devil: for the price of his soul he will show no signs of aging, but a painted portrait of him will reflect the toll of time and a life of indulgence. The portrait becomes as grotesque as his excesses, and when Dorian falls in love with a woman, he must keep the painting a secret. The movie is based on a novel by Oscar Wilde."

It is in the West Bank, not in Israel. The article also misstated the number of prisoners released in the first part of the swap, in October. It was 477 -- not 1,027, which was the total number released over both phases of the swap. And the article misstated Israeli charges against one of the freed prisoners, Izzedine Abu Sneineh, who had been arrested three years ago at age 15.

2011-12-21T00:00:00Z,"We often think of the Super Bowl winner as a dominant team that had an inevitable rise to power, but that's not often the case. In fact, last season, the Packers surprised everybody -- well, almost everybody -- by winning the Super Bowl as a No. 6 seed. Who wasn't surprised? In November, Toni Monkovic noted that the Packers were a sleeper because of their great points differential. Before the playoffs, Jason Lisk predicted that the sixth-seeded Packers would go to the Super Bowl for similar reasons. History tells us that it's not always the team with the best record that wins the Super Bowl. In the A.F.C., four teams have clinched the playoffs, while Denver and the Jets would be in with two wins, or one win and some help. (There's a mathematical possibility that the Jets could lose the tiebreaker even if they win both games, but it's remote.) In the N.F.C., three teams have clinched a playoff spot, and the Falcons and the Lions are just one win (or no wins and some help) away from earning a playoff berth. The final spot goes to the N.F.C.

2011-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The financially troubled Mets announced Tuesday that they were eliminating their minor league team in the Class A Gulf Coast League. That move could save them between $750,000 and $800,000, according to executives with other franchises who are familiar with the cost of running those teams. According to Jim Duquette, who was the Mets' farm director and their general manager and now is an analyst on Sirius XM's MLB Network Radio, the move saves money but may also reflect a new drafting philosophy. The Gulf Coast League is usually for draftees out of high school and for international signees. Most college draftees go straight to the New York-Penn League or the Florida State League, where the Mets retain affiliates."

I remember the smell of Christmas morning toast, slathered in butter and marmalade, set against the scent of mangrove and mud flat.

2011-12-21T00:00:00Z,"The whimsical secret of Audrey Hepburn's royal status may be the heart of William Wyler's ''Roman Holiday,'' but for years the romantic comedy concealed another more troubling truth: the film was missing the screenwriting credit of Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted writer and its original author, and instead attributed his work to Ian McLellan Hunter. Now, nearly 60 years after the 1953 release of ''Roman Holiday,'' the Writers Guild of America, West said it had restored Trumbo's credit following the efforts of Trumbo's and Hunter's sons. Trumbo, who died in 1976, was one of 10 filmmakers - the so-called Hollywood Ten - who were cited for contempt of Congress in 1947 when they refused to testify about their political beliefs before the House Un-American Activities Committee; he served 11 months in prison and was effectively unable to continue working in the film industry. After Trumbo wrote the screenplay for ''Roman Holiday'' in exile in Mexico, Hunter, who was later blacklisted himself, served as a front writer, receiving the payment for the work (which he passed along to Trumbo) as well as the writing credit (which he shared with another writer, John Dighton)."
2011-12-21T00:00:00Z,"In the classic Monty Python sketch ''Upper-Class Twit of the Year,'' a group of bumbling aristocrats compete on an obstacle course full of challenges both athletic (leaping over books of matches) and misanthropic (kicking beggars, insulting waiters). The competitor Oliver St. John-Mollusc, ''thought by many to be this year's outstanding twit,'' somehow runs himself over with a convertible midway through the race. John Cleese, as the play-by-play announcer, later says of Oliver, ''He's dead, but he's not necessarily out of it.'' Oliver's fate neatly sums up the current state of the Philadelphia Eagles. They were thought by many to be this year's outstanding twit, and they possessed a remarkable capacity for running themselves over. Yet they are not necessarily out of it."

(Factoring in the audiences that watched the show on DVR in the following seven days, that number grows to 12.4 million.)

The problem, to be clear, doesn't lie in the particular stance that the House Republicans have taken over the last week, insisting on a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut rather than two-month extension agreed to in the Senate. (On the merits, the House is right to want a full-year extension, the Senate's punt was an embarrassment, and the compromise that may be in the offing looks like better policy than a purely short-term deal.) Rather, it lies in the fact that we've been having drawn-out negotiations about the issue at all. Republicans should have just taken yes for answer, embraced a bipartisan tax cut, declared victory and gone home for Christmas. Instead, a Republican Party that blithely voted to extend the Bush tax cuts without any offsets suddenly became very, very concerned about ""paying for"" a far more modest measure, and a G.O.P. that's supposedly committed to the lowest possible middle class tax burden decided that it needed to extract concessions from a Democratic president in exchange for supporting ... a middle class tax cut."

Socolow, the director since 1997 of the MacArthur Foundation fellowship program known as the ''genius'' awards, will retire sometime in the next several months, foundation officials are expected to announce Thursday. While he wielded influence in the selection process and delighted in making the telephone calls to the winners, he did not directly choose them. Some 850 people in fields from poetry to physics have been named fellows since 1981. Those lucky winners not only had the prestige of the so-called ''genius'' awards (a term the foundation discourages), they also receive a no-strings-attached $500,000 fellowship from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago. The idea of the program was to liberate creative people in a broad swath of fields - from the well-known to the little-known - to do their work without worrying about resources."

Individually, they're working on related forms of minimalism, an old idea, but they're post-genre people, interested in the dirty magic of warping and transforming sounds and languages you might already know. Hubble makes music about small phrases and layered rhythms and tiny melodic variations: adding or bending some notes in a chain.

But eventually the original turned up in the hands of a cinematographer who said he had received it from Welles as a gift, and, after a court fight, it was turned over to Welles's daughter Beatrice. When the original first went on the block, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences went to court to try to stop the sale, but lost. Sotheby's later tried to sell it, but ended that effort when an undisclosed reserve price was not met. And, now, finally the Oscar has been sold in an auction that, according to Sanders, included an underbid from the magician David Copperfield.

Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said: ''It's almost impossible not to take liberties when putting this tale on screen. The novel is a leviathan of a read, thick with allegory, Scripture and some of the most poetic and dense writing in the English language. It's not exactly an easy fit for television.''
