2009-01-25T00:00:00Z,"OLSON--Jesse. The officers and staff of 1199 SEIU, United Healthcare Workers East, mourn the January 19 death of former Exec. VP Jesse Olson. Olson personified the dedication and commitment of the inspired generation that built our union. He was a key leader in the union's growth from a 5,000-member New York City pharmacy union in 1959 to what is now a 300,000member health care union ranging from Massachusetts to Maryland. For several decades Olson was one of the central figures assisting 1199 founder Leon Davis in the union's rapid growth. As head of the union's professional and technical division, he led in organizing and dramatically improving the salaries and benefits of 30,000 New York City health care workers ranging from x-ray techs to switchboard operators. Born in Manhattan in 1924, Olson served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. He joined 1199 in 1948 as a pharmacist and became an active shop steward. When the union began a major organizing drive in New York's hospitals in 1959, Olson took a pay cut of $65 a week to join the union staff as an organizer. He later said he did it in order to do ''Gods work'' by helping organize exploited hospital employees who were then called New York's ''forgotten workers.'' When he retired in 1998 after a 50-year union career, Olson said he was proud of assembling a top notch staff of dedicated organizers and of participating in the union's civil rights activities. He was part of the union honor guard defending Paul Robeson in the great singer's violence marred 1949 concert in Peekskill, NY, joined civil rights marchers in Selma, AL in 1965, and was able to vote for Barack Obama last November. Olson, 84, died near his home in Cranbury, NJ. Survivors include his wife of 58 years, Adele; children Paul and Nina; and two grandchildren.

Wayne Myers was born in New York on December 13, 1931 and graduated from The Bronx High School of Science. He went on to obtain a B.S.

The leadership, staff, and global community of the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourn the passing of our dear and most beloved friend, Gerald Blumberg. Jerry was dedicated to the Weizmann Institute both in spirit and in deed, professionally and personally. Jerry's work as an attorney led him to the Weizmann Institute, but in the more than 35 years that followed, it was Jerry himself who took the lead. As an authority in estate planning and charitable giving, Jerry lent his legal expertise to the American Committee. He was a former American Committee Vice President, an Honorary Vice Chairman, and a member of the President's Circle; he was also a Governor Emeritus of the Weizmann Institute. In him, the Weizmann Institute found a transformational figure whose passion would be inherited by his son, Larry-who now serves as the American Committee's National Chairman. Jerry's three decades of involvement embodied and fueled inspiration and innovation, now passed down from generation to generation. His legacy will forever be felt, and his spirit lives on through his children and grandchildren. We send heartfelt condolences to Jerry's wife, Rhoda, and the entire family.

After attending Cornell and the University of Florida, Rod married Bunny Halwer in 1942. They were a devoted couple for the next 66 years until her passing. After military service in WWII, Rod and Bunny lived in Manhattan, where they were early members of the Stuyvesant Town community. Rod became an export executive, traveling the world on business in the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, an era when travel in South America, Eastern Europe, India, and Asia was far more adventurous than today. But the main focus of Rod's life was his marriage and family. Rod and Bunny were inseparable; in later years she even accompanied him on his business trips overseas. They enjoyed the theater, bridge, and spending time with their many dear friends. After retiring in the early 1980's they continued to enjoy those relationships at Heritage Village in Southbury, Connecticut, and in West Palm Beach, Florida. Rod particularly enjoyed being part of local theater productions and poetry readings. With his deep, mellifluous voice, many thought he might have had a career as a professional singer. In 2006 Rod and Bunny moved to Oak Tree Villa, in Scotts Valley California, where Rod passed away just a few weeks before his 92nd birthday. Along with his marvelous baritone, Rod will be remembered by all who loved him for his kindness and generosity of spirit. Always the first to reach out a hand to those in need, he could always be counted on to come through when his friends or family needed help or support. He is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Dr. Les Elkind and Francine Genta of Santa Cruz, California, grandchildren Maren Giuliano, Gabriel Browne, Joshua DeCristo, and Laughlin Elkind, nephew Larry Elkind, of Hollywood, Florida, and a growing number of great-grandchildren.

So I was more than pleasantly surprised to discover that Nomi's sleek, angular, dressed-to-the-nines ghost is now making an appearance on the men's runways. Gareth Pugh wrapped up the week with a debut collection that featured a posse of cyber-goth wanderers, some of whom wore glossy coats and jackets that could have come from an outer space visitor -- or from Nomi's closet."

2009-01-26T12:27:45Z,"Pfizer's $68 billion deal to buy the rival drug maker Wyeth ranks among the largest pharmaceutical deals of all time. The acquisition, which is being paid for in cash and Pfizer stock, also breaks a long-running drought in the merger world, which hasn't seen such a large transaction (excluding spinoffs) since a group of banks bid nearly $96 billion for ABN Amro in April 2007."

Who wore them best? You tell us."
2009-01-26T11:55:15Z,"Barack Obama has said that his priority in the war on terrorism is Afghanistan, and is poised to increase troop levels there, perhaps by as many as 30,000.

2009-01-26T10:58:34Z,"One of the knocks on ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is that while it has charmed most critics and many awards bestowers, it really hasn't done the kind of business that demonstrates it is really connecting. You can put that one away. In week 11 of its release, it went wide and large, racking up more than $10.5 million for a cumulative box office of almost $56 million and counting.

2009-01-27T16:11:07Z,"I could have stayed and watched the Chanel show again. In theory, anything as repetitive as an all-white fashion show, staged before a white background of paper cutouts, should have been boring. Our brains demand a little more stimulation-because that's what we get most days-and when we see an all-white or all-black show, the effect wears off pretty quickly. But it seems to me that the Chanel show wasn't really about white (or black and white) clothes, any more than it was about paper, although writing paper was Karl Lagerfeld's starting point. The reason I could have stayed for an encore was that the collection expresses perfectly the difference between haute couture and ready-to-wear. Couture offers someone like Lagerfeld the luxury of concentrating on a single idea. The whiteness of the show-the white wool suits edged with tiny white braid, the white plisse chiffon spilling from vented white sleeves, the white plastic flowers embroidered on white silk-reinforced that notion. Lagerfeld was like a fly that dropped onto a leaf and then surveyed all. But the leaf told him everything."

2009-01-28T09:52:23Z,"UPDATE: A lawyer for John Landis has told The Associated Press that he would sue to stop production of the “Thriller” musical if necessary. In a statement, James L. Nederlander said, “I’m confident that these past differences can be worked out.”ORIGINAL POST: Having filmed Michael Jackson dancing in a graveyard, the filmmaker John Landis now seeks to bring the King of Pop somewhere equally as frightening: a court of law. Last week, Mr. Landis, the director and co-writer of the video for Mr. Jackson’s “Thriller,” filed suit against Mr. Jackson for unpaid profits from the video and a making-of documentary, Variety reported. The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, says that for the past four years Mr. Jackson and his company Optimum Productions have failed to pay Mr. Landis money he is owed from these film projects or to account for the profits. On Monday, the Nederlander Organization announced that it had acquired the rights to produce a musical based on “Thriller” and its video, an homage to horror movies in which Mr. Jackson turns into a werewolf and a zombie."

2009-01-28T12:30:45Z,"And how many years must Bob Dylan wait before he licenses one of his most beloved ballads for use in a British television commercial? The answer, my friends, is 47. Mr. Dylan, the trickster troubadour, has once again baffled his fans by giving permission for his protest song “Blowin’ in the Wind” to be used in an advertisement for the Co-operative Group, Agence France-Presse reported. The song, which Mr. Dylan began performing in 1962 and appears on the 1963 Columbia Records album “The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan,” is the first that he’s allowed for use in British commercials; the company, which operates supermarkets as well as travel, legal and funeral services, is a proponent of ethical and accountable trading practices.

He was drafted out of Notre Dame in the third round by the Colts in 1997, only to be released after the 2000 season. That was followed by a stint at a Rams training camp, a couple of games with the Edmonton Eskimos of the C.F.L. and then three seasons in Denver, where he rose from reserve to starting defensive end.

""I initially quit just to paint and spend more time in my studio -- but things took a different turn.""Or different turns: her fashion label Octopi recently unveiled its exquisite spring 2009 collection, and she's half of the electronic duo Free Blood, which just released its party-starting debut album, ""The Singles"" (Rong/DFA Records).

2009-01-29T05:36:15Z,"My Thursday column argues that we need an investigative commission looking at torture and other abuses, and that the chance is slipping away. President Obama and some other Democrats are worried of antagonizing Republicans whom they will need to advance the Obama agenda, but it should be possible to devise a commission that has enough Republicans high up that it will never be perceived as a witch hunt. That's why I came up with the idea for a McCain-Scowcroft Commission -- and please offer your own ideas for the leadership and membership."
2009-01-29T05:35:23Z,"An open secret: In press boxes throughout the country, when we sportswriters really need to see what happened, we watch on television, too. Why?

2009-01-29T03:00:00Z,"Amouage is a niche house - and a very expensive one, at that - that is run out of London but has its roots in the Middle East. Those roots are essentially two: the house's wealthy Omani financial backers (the royal family, actually) and its Arabian peninsula olfactory aesthetic. I have often found that Amouage scents bear more of Arab culture's obsession with incense than I can assimilate (Arabia is one of the great originators of the use of incense), heavy and thick, perhaps mixed with smoky, all-but-charred roses, the whole contraption's volume set to ""Overwhelm."" (The grimace-inducing French corollary is animalic notes: the civet fecal smell of Jicky; Jicky's armpit-and-dirty-underwear grandson, Kouros; and so on. The American contribution to this list would be the army of American perfumes smelling of scrubbed shower tile and aluminum foil -- though, for the record, this genre was created, inconceivably, by a French perfumer.)"

2009-01-29T00:00:00Z,"The owner of a leather-goods factory was sentenced to a year in prison Tuesday for harboring and concealing illegal immigrants at the plant, which agents raided in 2007. The man, Francesco Insolia, pleaded guilty in November. He said in court he took full responsibility for not taking any action after being informed that illegal immigrants were working in his factory in New Bedford. “I’m responsible for the conduct,” Mr. Insolia said. “Never in my worst nightmare would I think I’d find myself in the position I am in today.” Mr. Insolia’s company, Michael Bianco Inc., was ordered to pay $1 million for 18 counts of knowingly hiring illegal immigrants from 2004 to late 2006. When the factory was raided in March 2007, federal authorities arrested 361 workers, most of them from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras."
2009-01-29T00:00:00Z,"The pilots of two Phoenix news helicopters had so many distractions that they lost track of each other, resulting in a midair collision that killed four, a National Transportation Safety Board panel said. The panel said the probable cause of the accident in July 2007 was that the two helicopters drifted too close together because the pilots were focused on watching a police car chase and reporting the event for their television stations. The five-member board unanimously recommended that television stations no longer have helicopter pilots also report while they fly unless the stations can demonstrate that the pilots can do both safely. One of the Phoenix stations involved in the crash now has a second pilot do reporting, while the other station no longer has pilots report as they fly, investigators said."

Mr. Warr said that the charges had nothing to do with his role as mayor and that he would continue to run Gulfport, a coastal city of about 73,000 people. The Warrs are accused of seeking a grant for a storm-damaged beachfront home they owned but did not live in. The government is seeking forfeiture of $222,798. Mr. Warr, 45, and his wife, 43, also are accused of making false claims to their insurance company."
2009-01-29T00:00:00Z,"A resolution congratulating Barack Obama on his election as president was rejected by a committee of the Arkansas House of Representatives after lawmakers objected to language in the measure that referred to the United States as “a nation founded by slave owners.” Eight of the 11 members of the panel, the State Agencies Committee, who opposed the resolution were Republicans, and one Republican joined five Democrats in supporting it. Two Democrats abstained. Opponents said the measure inaccurately presumed that all the nation’s founders were slaveholders. The resolution’s sponsor, Representative Stephanie Flowers, Democrat of Pine Bluff and the daughter of a pioneering black Arkansas lawyer and judge, said that “it’s unfortunate that we can’t accept the truth of our history,” and that she saw “no reason” to rewrite passages that some Republicans said were “divisive.”."
2009-01-29T00:00:00Z,"The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, which regulates fishing in federal waters in the gulf, approved regulations that would for the first time allow aquaculture in federal waters of the United States. The move, contested by environmental groups, must be confirmed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees fisheries councils nationwide. Shellfish aquaculture is common in state waters, which typically extend to three miles offshore, and there are some small finfish operations there. But finfish aquaculture in federal waters has been delayed by, among other things, the slow progress in the Congress of regulatory legislation. Critics of finfish aquaculture say the farms can spread diseases and note that the demand for fish pellets used to feed farmed fish is sharply depleting wild stocks of fish like menhaden. Advocates say the farms could help reduce fish imports, which account for 80 percent or more of fish eaten in the United States."

In 1980, Larry began his career as an airline industry executive when he joined the Los Angeles-based Flying Tigers as its General Counsel. Flying Tigers was, at that time, the world's largest all-cargo airline. In 1986, Stephen M. Wolf became the airlines Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In 1988, Larry moved to Chicago, where he joined United Airlines as Executive Vice President and General Counsel, serving again under Stephen M. Wolf, the Chief Executive Officer. Larry helped navigate United through a period of tremendous growth and transformation that ultimately resulted in an employee buyout of the company in 1994. Larry then became of counsel to the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LP, in its Chicago office, until March 1996 when he joined the Virginia-based, US Airways, again under the leadership of Mr. Wolf. Since retirement from US Airways in 2002, Larry had been a Senior Strategic Advisor with the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, in their New York City office. From the time Larry was a young boy he had a passion for the airline industry--he spent time at Los Angeles International Airport watching airplanes take off and land. He pored over airline schedules and collected airline memorabilia. He always felt fortunate to have transformed a childhood love of airplanes into a lasting and singular career in aviation. Larry leaves his beloved wife of 41 years, Sherrie, his two adored sons, Daniel, a Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Benjamin, a partner in the law firm, Sidley Austin LLP, Daniels wife, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Ph.D., also a Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Benjamins wife, Melissa Kotlen Nagin, a lactation consultant and writer for About.com; five precious and beloved grandchildren: Zachary Samuel Nagin, Sarah Rose Nagin, Alexander Gabriel Nagin, Julius Brown Nagin, and Avishai Brown Nagin; his adored sister Fredericka and her children, David Miller (Judy Miller M.D.), Deborah Miller and Jennifer Tidstrand (Douglas Tid strand).

While Joe was attending Medical School, Anna did research at the pioneering immunological laboratory of Albert Sabin at Bellevue. During WWII while Joe ran the medical services at Walters Army Base in Texas, Anna set up one of the first early childhood education programs in Texas. Anna was a radical and original thinker but also extremely practical and immensely charming and intelligent. Anna maintained her intense curiosity and enthusiasm into advanced age. After WWII Anna worked tirelessly in Sunnyside, Queens as a community activist, advocating rational choice within the public schools, based on pedagogy rather than political ideology. In the late fifties, Anna became a science teacher in the public schools. She was a wonderful, inspiring and charismatic teacher. She completed her Ph.D. in microbiology and then worked on infectious diseases at Haskins Laboratory at Pace University with Seymour Hutner. Anna had a rich life and has left an inspiring legacy. Aside from her achievements as a scientist: Anna loved music, she was an accomplished pianist, a wicked scrabble player, visually sophisticated and advanced in her taste, a wonderful and adventurous cook, and most importantly a warm compassionate friend who always encouraged others to pursue their dreams. She was a beacon of light and deeply loved by all who knew her. The service is Thursday, 12:45pm at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In lieu of flowers donations in Anna's memory can be sent to: The Mt. Sinai Visiting Doctors Program, One Gustave Levy Place, Box 1216, NYC, NY 10024."

So I have to cover all the areas with my album. You get Lil Wayne’s take on the new president, Lil Wayne’s take on money, the economy, Lil Wayne’s take on women, Lil Wayne’s take on whatever.” When Ms. Couric asks Lil Wayne, who has rapped about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, what question he would put to former President Bush about it, he answered: “I’m a gangster, and gangsters don’t ask questions.” But they do answer them, apparently. Watch a preview of the interview here."

The question, which had nothing to do with my lesson, was a good one. Wine has a constant presence in the epic poem, whose most famous image is probably Homer's evocation of the ""wine-dark sea"" that Odysseus sails in search of his native Ithaka. Sometimes it is mere tonic on an impossibly long journey home from the Trojan War, but on occasion wine is more powerful than the sword, as when Odysseus escapes from the Cyclops by getting him drunk. Homer may have been blind, but his taste buds were alive to wine, and he reserved his richest adjectives for it: heady, mellow, ruddy, shining, glowing, seasoned, hearty, honeyed, glistening, heart-warming, and, of course, irresistible."

Sovak was 67. The holder of 22 biomedical and technical patents, Dr. Sovak's contributions encompassed the discovery of the most widely used non-ionic radiographic contrast media for diagnostic imaging and the groundbreaking synthesis of a novel compound that made possible the production of the first protease inhibitor HIV drug, Nelfinavir. Beyond his medical discoveries, his revolutionary break - resistant chain for power saws is today an industry standard used by firemen around the world and his line of fine crafted etching presses are considered by artists to be the best in class. A citizen of the world, Dr. Sovak was the eldest son of a family of renowned intellectuals and pillars of Prague's cultural community between the wars. Fleeing communist Czechoslovakia in 1963 after receiving M.D. from Charles University in Prague, he undertook radiology training at the University of Copenhagen and later Temple University in Philadelphia, the recipient of a James Picker Foundation Fellowship, finally joining the faculty of the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Sovak published over 170 articles, book chapters, abstracts and monographs, and served as chairman of numerous international symposia. In 1981 he established Biophysica Inc., a developmental laboratory in La Jolla, California where he dedicated himself to research in medical imaging, cytostatics and phytochemicals for cancer therapy. An active member of several professional organizations, he was awarded the Harry Fischer Prize in 1995 in recognition of his substantive contributions to diagnostic radiology. In 1990, Dr. Sovak was summoned to Prague to aid the Czech government (National Council) in the post-communist restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry and formulation of first national health care laws. There, he undertook the revitalization of Interpharma Praha, a then defunct former producer of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and drove it to become an internationally prominent research and manufacturing entity engaged in the development of novel agents for the therapy of resistant Prostate Cancer. A gifted book designer, typographer and publisher of bibliophilic limited editions, Dr. Sovak excelled at matching unusual manuscripts with original art created specifically for the books, designed as art objects, through Ettan Press. A polymath, he drifted deftly from his native Czech to English, German, Danish, Swedish, French, Italian and Spanish with a working knowledge of Japanese. Perhaps nothing better defined this Renaissance man than his receipt of a PEN literary award for his translation of Czech poet Vitezslav Nezvals Antilyric (Sun and Moon Press, Los Angeles) in September 2002, the same month that he authored an internationally acclaimed lead manuscript on prostate cancer in the prestigious US publication, Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI). Throughout his life Sovak strove to recapture and advance the cultural traditions that had formed his early years. The tragic circumstances of his exile, sense of isolation and perception of the disappearance of humanism, so dear to his heart, had a lifelong impact upon him and his work. It was his firm belief that his successes reflected the unique freedoms and opportunities afforded to him by America, his adopted country. He is survived by his brother Mojmir Sovak, his wife Dietlind Antretter and their twin boys, Maximilian and Eliot. The family wishes that donations be made to advance cancer research and the work of Dr. Robert Nagourney through the Nagourney Institute, 750 East 29th Street, Long Beach, CA 90806."

2009-01-30T00:00:00Z,"NAGIN--Lawrence M.,died on Wednesday, January 28, 2009, of complications from cancer. Larry, a third-generation Californian, was born on February 14, 1941, in San Francisco; the son of Maurine M. Nagin and David L. Nagin. Within a few months, Larry moved with his family, including his loving sister, Fredericka, and his beloved ''Ria'', Marie E. Jacobs, to Los Angeles. Larry attended public schools in the City of Los Angeles and received a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations from the University of Southern California in 1962. He then attended The University of California, Hastings College of the Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in 1965. He became a Member of the State Bar of California, and remained a member for more than 42 years. From 1966 to 1968, Larry served as a Deputy Public Defender for the County of Los Angeles. From 1968 to 1974, Larry was in private practice in the City of Beverly Hills. From 1974 to 1980, Larry served as Special Counsel to the City Attorney of the City of Los Angeles, and then Senior Assistant City Attorney representing the Los Angeles Department of Airports. In 1980, Larry began his career as an airline industry executive when he joined the Los Angeles-based Flying Tigers as its General Counsel. Flying Tigers was, at that time, the world's largest all-cargo airline. In 1986, Stephen M. Wolf became the airlines Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In 1988, Larry moved to Chicago, where he joined United Airlines as Executive Vice President and General Counsel, serving again under Stephen M. Wolf, the Chief Executive Officer. Larry helped navigate United through a period of tremendous growth and transformation that ultimately resulted in an employee buyout of the company in 1994. Larry then became of counsel to the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LP, in its Chicago office, until March 1996 when he joined the Virginia-based, US Airways, again under the leadership of Mr. Wolf. Since retirement from US Airways in 2002, Larry had been a Senior Strategic Advisor with the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, in their New York City office. From the time Larry was a young boy he had a passion for the airline industry--he spent time at Los Angeles International Airport watching airplanes take off and land. He pored over airline schedules and collected airline memorabilia. He always felt fortunate to have transformed a childhood love of airplanes into a lasting and singular career in aviation. Larry leaves his beloved wife of 41 years, Sherrie, his two adored sons, Daniel, a Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Benjamin, a partner in the law firm, Sidley Austin LLP, Daniels wife, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Ph.D., also a Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Benjamins wife, Melissa Kotlen Nagin, a lactation consultant and writer for About.com; five precious and beloved grandchildren: Zachary Samuel Nagin, Sarah Rose Nagin, Alexander Gabriel Nagin, Julius Brown Nagin, and Avishai Brown Nagin; his adored sister Fredericka and her children, David Miller (Judy Miller M.D.), Deborah Miller and Jennifer Tidstrand (Douglas Tid strand). In addition, he is survived by his loving brother-inlaw, Robert Gandin, DDS, his loving sisters-in-law, Mindy Gandin, Louise Feinberg, Marsha Gandin, and many dear nieces and nephews. Services will be held on Friday, January 30, 2009, at 9:30am at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Street at 81st Street, New York, NY.

2009-01-31T11:27:35Z,"Re ""Standing Between Enemies"" (Jan. 11): Sorry, your explanation doesn't carry water.Hamas wants to kill every Jew, and its leaders have said so. The Fatah leaders have decided that rather than fight Israel, they will build a country for their citizens, and Israel is helping them toward that end. Hamas should do the same, and The Times should face these hard facts and call a spade a spade.When you hide behind civilians, civilians will get killed. They are terrorists and cowards - no more than that.Richard FentonBoca Raton, Fla., Jan. 12, 2009 Your column about The Times's evenhanded coverage of the Israel-Palestinian conflict is ironic because the column itself is pro-Palestinian.Why doesn't the paragraph that begins ""But the readers I am hearing from are not ready to accept that notion"" end with something negative about the Palestinians, just like the first sentence does about the Israelis?You could have written: ""Supporters of the Palestinians are offended at the mention of the unprovoked killing of at least 18 Israelis since 2001 by Hamas rockets, the thousands of rockets fired into Israeli cities or the misuse of the millions in aid by the Palestinian leadership to buy weapons instead of providing infrastructure and employment.""Later, you quote Patrick Witty, a photo editor, as saying, ""There's nothing fair in war photography."" But you don't mention a significant fact. It's no surprise that the barrage of rockets launched will result in more Palestinian deaths since Israel builds bomb shelters while Hamas launches rockets from sites near United Nations schools.Debbie FeldmanDavid FeldmanScotch Plains, N.J., Jan. 12, 2009 ● You are not correct when you say that Times reporters are doing the best they can counting bodies with counts provided by hospitals, agencies and so on, and choosing the ones the editors and writers think most credible.Nor is The Times fair when it publishes a picture of a person holding a dead child. Pictures influence people, as do statistics about those apparently killed when a bomb went off, not on a house where those people hid, but on a neighboring street (which one has to glean reading other articles).""Hamas militants are fighting in civilian clothes; even the police have been ordered to take off their uniforms,"" Steven Erlanger reports on Page 1 of the Jan. 11 paper. The article also talks of a ""Hamas tactic of asking civilians to stand on the roofs of buildings so Israeli pilots will not bomb.""How is a count of so-called civilians killed, no matter who reports it, an accurate account? What kind of a civilization puts its civilians in such jeopardy?Israel is castigated for not having enough casualties. But Israel has built bomb shelters to protect its people, while Hamas has dug tunnels for transmitting weapons and deliberately puts people in harm's way.The Times should send reporters to see how Israel has prepared for assaults and send photographers to show Israeli citizens maimed by Hamas bombing. The Times won't even need to whine that its photographers can't enter the war zone to do so. Have an equal number of civilian atrocities pictured, if you are so bent on equality.Marilyn ShapiroBloomfield Hills, Mich., Jan. 11, 2009 ● While you try eloquently to make the case that the Times coverage of the Gaza conflict is fair and balanced, I believe you fall short. ""But most of the destruction is in Gaza, and news photographs are not about blame but about showing what happened,"" you write, and add that ""fear in Israel is more difficult to capture with a camera.""You do not, however, address the more fundamental question of why photos of Gaza destruction almost always appear as a front-page banner while any Israeli photos that The Times does manage to get are buried in the middle of the paper.Do you believe that showing what happened, almost always inflammatory to the Arab world, merits front-page placement while Israeli suffering or destruction is less front-page worthy? Or perhaps The Times would rather not offend those in Arab or Muslim countries rather than balance its front-page ""damage only"" photos.Avram T. GelbBrooklyn, Jan. 11, 2009 ● I don't think that you avoid ""bias"" by giving ""equal"" coverage to ""both sides"" of an issue. Indeed, not all arguments are equally accurate, right and instructive.True, we are trapped in the world of interpretation; for us human beings, there are no ultimate, absolute truths. But there are better arguments than others, otherwise all arguments would be equally devoid of any content - or worse, everything is possible. For example, if someone thinks the Holocaust was right, and I think that it was unacceptable, we would each be entitled to our ""opinion."" But does fairness work this way?Absolutely not: not all arguments are equal, and there are definitely wrong ones. So how do you distinguish between a better argument? A better argument is the one that is more complex, that instead of passion and simplistic racial, national or hatred overtones, presents clear arguments, a history of the problem at hand, and a detailed context in which the issue discussed has been and is embedded.Maricler MostoSan Diego, Jan. 11, 2009 ● While I agree with you that reporting from a war zone, particularly in the Middle East, will get you blame from all sides, I respectfully disagree that ""news photographs are not about blame."" They may not be created as such, but for many the visual prompt is the first thing they see and for some helps assign blame before the article is even read.Steven M. ClaytonOcean, N.J., Jan. 11, 2009 ● You write that The Times ""has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job"" regarding reporting on the situation in Gaza. I believe that in general that is correct. But to report the number of civilian Palestinian deaths without an attempt to determine how many of the civilians were with members of Hamas at the time of an attack by Israel supports an anti-Israeli position.The world needs all the facts when it comes to civilian deaths in this particular situation to understand how Hamas operates in violation of human rights. Phil SandineWashington Crossing, Pa., Jan. 11, 2009● You give a scrupulously honest, detailed and documented analysis of the fairness issue concerning Times coverage of the war in Gaza. It is of utmost importance that this matter be addressed in a manner convincing to anyone who is seeking the truth and is not an unmovable partisan of either side.Israeli and Hamas leaders and their supporters are using every conceivable argument to try to win the battle for public opinion, to ""prove"" that the other side is wholly to blame for this conflict.The sad, horrible reality is that both sides are to blame for this wretched, unnecessary war. Both sides had long been preparing for it. Each side, by acts committed before and since this all-out bloodletting began, is guilty of terrorism, unspeakable atrocities and war crimes.How can either side believe it can attain a true victory? Both have already lost too much in dead and wounded, in physical resources and in the respect of the rest of the world. They need to get back to the negotiating table.Landrum R. BollingWashington, Jan. 12, 2009The writer is a senior adviser to Mercy Corps on humanitarian assistance programs in the Middle East.●●Re ""Leaps of Faith, and the Trouble That Followed"" (Jan. 18): I enjoyed your thoughtful piece on the difficulties of establishing the truth for the purposes of journalism. As a former professor of Roman history at the Université de Montréal who has devoted the last couple of decades to studying how civil war came about and brought the Roman Republic to an end, I would slightly alter the advice that you cited from Ronald Reagan: Never trust, and always verify.Another politician, Julius Caesar, wrote an account of his violation of Roman law and ethical standards that has succeeded in misleading generations of readers. Trust in his account is misplaced. No source, however well placed, can be taken on faith.In his ""Civil War,"" Caesar selectively narrates events so as to leave readers with the impression that he invaded Italy crossing the Rubicon in response to an emergency decree passed against him by the Senate of Rome. Logistics, however, demonstrate that his army was already on the march.Even more significantly, Caesar was not above threatening physical violence upon any tribune of the plebs who might choose to oppose him. He omits the threats that he uttered. Instead, he claims that his enemies had left the Treasury of Rome unlocked when they abandoned the city two months earlier.Of course, there was criticism at the time and thereafter. Voices like those of Cicero and Cato the Younger were effectively dragooned into service or silenced. But even in Caesar's camp there were those who recognized that not all was right. Despite his reverence for the master, Asinius Pollio noted that Caesar's narrative of the civil war years was marred by factual ""errors.""Surprisingly, however, scholars have largely accepted the ""great man's"" self-portrait as an accurate representation of historical reality. Few are the voices that dissent. Perhaps the desire for figures that are larger than life and mythological in nature may account for this failing.In the wake of the Bush era and its claims of ""great men"" and ""decisive battles,"" we would do well to be wary of any simplistic vision of reality.Nor should we ever let our guard down and trust someone on the sole basis of his or her own testimony. That is how democracies come to an end.Richard WestallRome, Jan. 18, 2009 ● I have been reading The Times since I was 12 (I'm now 61). I am aghast that seasoned people could make what I think are rookie mistakes.Particularly disturbing is the fake letter to the editor. Wasn't Sarah Palin tricked by a fake phone call from the French president? There were so many warning signs in the letter that I cannot believe your editor did not pick up the phone to verify.Also, the reporters' or editors' excuses for the erroneous stories wouldn't get by a fifth grade teacher. This was shameful and inexcusable for a paper I have revered my entire adult life.Jonathan BrombergFlagstaff, Ariz., Jan. 21, 2009 ● I read your criticism of the Thayer Evans article about the recruitment of Jamarkus McFarland. While I appreciate the effort to correct the obvious mistruths of the ""party,"" the effort does not begin to address the other major problems with the article.The article made damaging accusations of cheating on the part of the University of Texas and painted the University of Oklahoma in a positive light. It referred to an ""interest-free loan for a former classmate"" if McFarland chose Texas. Was that independently corroborated? Who offered what and when? How much? What were the conditions? The article also indicates that Texas Coach Mack Brown was bragging about the size of his house. Coach Brown is known in the world of college football as a humble, respectful person. This quote seems very out of character for such a classy individual. Why was Coach Brown not contacted to respond to this allegation?You cannot un-ring a bell. The damage is done. Without a full investigation into all of the allegations made in this one-sided article, you still have not done your due diligence. Kent AftergutDallas, Jan. 18, 2009 ● Thayer Evans wrote things that were damaging to the University of Texas without verifying whether they were true. There were contradictions in the article that a junior high student would have questioned. First, McFarland's mother stated that she loved the persistence of the Oklahoma University recruiter but almost canceled the trip to University of Texas because the Longhorns were bugging her too much. That makes no sense.Second, regarding the wild party in Dallas after the Texas-O.U. game: McFarland was a guest of O.U. at that game, so how did he end up at a Texas party? Where was his mother during the party? Where was the party? You say, ""The reporter did not ask who invited the young man to the party, who accompanied him or who else might have witnessed the lurid events.""Was the phone call regarding the interest-free loan investigated? Was the classmate of McFarland's mother called for verification? And the most unbelievable part was Texas Coach Mack Brown's supposed comment: ""Whose house do you like better, Bob Stoops's, Les Miles's or mine?"" Are you serious? Do you know anything about Mack Brown? He would never make such a comment. Roger ThompsonAustin, Tex., Jan. 18, 2009 ● Journalism today is at a crossroads, and what has happened at the Times in recent months did not help the situation. Journalism is an important function in a Democratic society, and journalists must do all they can to maintain credibility.The mistakes you describe that were made by Times journalists are troubling, because the reporters and editors did not do their job and check what their sources said.I applaud your column for examining the mistakes that were made and including an explanation of why certain decisions were made.We must remember that what is printed affects people and their lives. Thus, we must verify what is told to us to make sure what is reported is truthful. This lies at the very core of journalism itself.Ryan VivianBaton Rouge, La., Jan. 18, 2009"

Upon moving to New York in 1972 Doris furthered her filmmaking visions and became recognized as a pioneer of video art. She produced over 70 films.

This lead to the ''By Herself'' series which focused on moments, realizations, and decisions in women's lives. In 1993 she produced a documentary about the Chelsea Hotel which was her home until 2004. Over the years she received many civic honors for her art and lifetime achievement. Her artwork is in numerous public and museum collections worldwide including: Museum of Modern Art, New York, Smithsonian, Washington, DC, British Film Institute, London.

An original member and shareholder of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Capozza was a strong advocate for modernization and members' rights. In the year 2000, he worked with Chairman Rappaport to establish the Exchange's first electronic trading system. Subsequently, he fought hard to protect members' equity rights as the Exchange made the transition into the era of electronic trading, undertook an IPO, and was ultimately sold to the Chicago Mercantile Ex change. The son of Italian immigrants, Capozza grew up in Tarrytown, NY where his father, Frank, established Frank's Fuel Company, and where his mother, Anna, kept the company books. Young Cataldo drove one of the company's fuel delivery trucks throughout the NY area often having to battle his way down the streets in some of the rougher neighborhoods. He later attended NYU where he earned a degree in economics and business. It was, perhaps, this blend of energies that enabled him to fight for ''a level playing field'' in his dual careers as a real estate entrepreneur and as a commodities trader. When asked by his brother Joe how he wanted to be remembered in this life, Capozza replied: ''As a warrior for all those who in fairness and integrity-pursue the American Dream.'' He is survived by his beloved wife, Suzanne; his sons Seth and Brad; his brother Joe; eight cherished nieces and nephews; and three grandchildren: Christian, Leeann and John.

2009-02-01T00:00:00Z,"PROOF It is unlikely that a modern-day Aristotle would ever find himself in a fraternity house playing beer pong to the sounds of Lynyrd Skynyrd. But the historian James Davidson describes the ancient Greek symposium, a ''classic moderate drinking party'' common to the wealthier households of Athens, during which men of stature would engage in lively debate with bowls of wine dispensed under the careful watch of a symposiarch (a sort of strict toastmaster). The most famous of these is recounted in Plato's ''Symposium,'' where Socrates and his friends, still hung over from the night before, decide on an evening of light drinking. The temperance pays off: in the ensuing discussion, they summon an overarching vision of love that has endured in the Western imagination for more than two millennia."

Its 4-cylinder engine -- Honda enthusiasts referred to it by its engine code: F20C -- was only 2 liters, but made 240 horsepower. It had a redline of 9,000 r.p.m., and the car was most effective the closer you drove to that engine speed, which was a loud proposition."

Grace in 1976 and elected Vice Chairman in 1981. He retired from W.R. Grace in 1986.

But now, even the charade of the Ascender (a Chevy TrailBlazer) and i-Series trucks (a k a, the Chevy Colorado) comes to an end. Isuzu entered the United States in 1981 and enjoyed modest success with vehicles like the Impulse -- a Giorgetto Giugiaro design that featured ''handling by Lotus'' -- and the Trooper S.U.V. Isuzu's famous ad campaign, which featured the actor David Leisure as smarmy pitchman Joe Isuzu, is probably better remembered than the actual cars it was designed to sell. In one spot for the P'up truck -- one of the few nameplates in the truck world to include punctuation -- Mr. Leisure's pathologically lying character offers customers ''3.9 percent financing or 500 pounds of bananas.'' In another spot that now seems horribly inappropriate, an Isuzu Trooper is compared to a Cherokee -- but not a Jeep, an actual Native American on a horse.

Women, with few exceptions, give the weather its due with the proper clothing and boots, although they're not always waterproof.

''Several of my co-workers wanted to go, too, but when it came down to it, I guess they saw how cold it was going to be and changed their minds. But I was determined to go, so I drove up by myself from Charlotte the Saturday before. The inauguration meant a lot to me. I got there at 7:30, and I stood on this little brick wall the whole time. For the first couple of hours, I probably could have sat down, but I didn't want to. So many people were there, regardless of their race. Yes, he is the first African-American president. But he also just seems like a really serious person who's willing to try to do the best he can for our country. That picture was taken right after he was sworn in. For me, that was the finishing moment -- that this is real; this is the truth. At that moment, I was just thanking God it had happened.'' As told to Austin Considine"

It is with great sadness that we inform Colgate people around the world that John Watkins, a long-time and beloved Colgate leader who contributed greatly to the company's strategy and success, passed away on Thursday, January 22. His health and spirits had been good in recent years, more than twenty years after a tragic surf accident that left him physically paralyzed at the height of his career, but undiminished in his wit, wisdom and loyalty to Colgate. A native of Wales, John's illustrious career with Colgate began in 1964 and saw his rapid rise through marketing positions in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America, before he assumed leadership of ColgatePalmolive Italy in 1974. Returning to New York in 1979, he briefly headed Colgate's U.S. Household Products Division and later became the leader of all product management activities for Colgate's U.S. business. With his appointment as Group Vice President for Corporate Strategy and Worldwide Business Planning in 1981, the predecessor group to Global Marketing, he helped develop the strategy that would lead to Colgate's sharp worldwide category focus, financial discipline and subsequent success. Named a Corporate Officer beginning in 1981 and Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Strategic and Business Development Officer in 1984, he expanded his key leadership role on the senior team reporting to the CEO. With his tragic accident in 1987, John and his wife Jo embarked on a new phase in their lives, persevering in a recovery that restored his speech and respiratory functions. With his characteristic Welsh determination, he maintained his Colgate connections and his business interests, sharing his extensive experience as a university lecturer in Florida. A memorial service will be held on Friday, February 6 at 4pm, Saint Christopher's by the Sea Episcopal Church, 95 Harbor Drive, Key Biscayne, FL 33149. Colgate people join Jo and the family in fond and grateful remembrance of John, a true friend to Colgate, and extend our deepest condolences. In loving Memory from Colgate People Everywhere"

Touted by some as a forerunner of the kind of concept musical later refined by Stephen Sondheim, ''Allegro'' might be described as a thematic fusion of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' (the show has a supernatural element) and the 1981 Sondheim-George Furth musical ''Merrily We Roll Along'' (a successful man becomes disillusioned with the urban high life)."

2009-02-02T00:00:00Z,"Lukas Foss, a prolific and versatile composer who was also a respected pianist and conductor, died at his home in Manhattan on Sunday. He was 86, and also had a home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. His wife, Cornelia, announced his death. Although he was a German émigré, Mr. Foss was, from the start of his composing career, considered an important voice in the burgeoning world of American composition, along with Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Elliott Carter and Leonard Bernstein. And like Bernstein, he enthusiastically championed the works of his colleagues. But where Bernstein, in his compositions, melded jazz and theater music with a lush symphonic neo-Romanticism -- or wrote theater music outright -- Mr. Foss preferred to explore the byways of the avant-garde, focusing at different times on techniques from serialism and electronic music to Minimalism and improvisation. But as he moved from style to style, his voice remained distinctive, partly because he distrusted rules and never fully adhered to those of the approaches he adopted, and partly because a current of mercurial wit ran through his work."

Our beautiful, colorful light, who brightened our lives for well nigh 40 years, has gone dim, after shimmering for many months beyond reasonable expectations solely because of her unquenchable will to attend Bettina's bat mitzvah and super human tender loving care by her family, doctors and nurses. A perfect match to start with, Carol and Lynn were blessed with Jennifer and Ian, each so rare a gem. That magnificent foursome then set about spinning their magnificent cocoon, bringing into its special and distinctive warmth, Gary and Suzy, and then Bettina, Jonathan, William, Charlie, Natalia and Augie. Together they created the winner of the Family Super Bowl. Carol and Lynn's romance did not need castles rising in Spain, just one another holding hands, either walking down a shop-lined street or through a flea market, or watching a movie. Carol--a great friend with a delightful sense of humor, who did nothing with less than a full heart and always with great taste, had a keen eye for beauty and impeccable quality--both in people and in possessions from A-Z, and was the hostess with the mostest. As a daughter to her adored mother Betty, sister to Blanche and Fran, as a wife, mother, grandmother and aunt, Carol, like Abu Ben Adam, led all the rest.

Within weeks nearly two million children in 44 states had received the inoculations. Based on David M. Oshinsky's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ''Polio: An American Story,'' this ''American Experience'' documentary from Sarah Colt chronicles the bitter battle between Salk and his rival, Albert Sabin, that resulted in the eradication of the virus in the United States.

Describing the award in her eBay listing as “a rare, once in a lifetime, opportunity for the true theater buff,” the estate has set the starting bid for the trophy at $10,000 (with an option for a lucky collector to buy it outright for $20,000); they have also thrown in sketches of the costumes she created for Ben Vereen and Stubby Kaye. “Grind,” a musical set in a 1933 Chicago burlesque house, with a book by Fay Kanin, lyrics by Ellen Fitzhugh and music by Larry Grossman, ran for just over two months at the Mark Hellinger Theater in 1985; in his review of the show, Frank Rich wrote that “when ‘Grind’ grinds to its halt just before intermission, ignorance at this show is bliss.”"

After attending 17 days straight of fashion shows, first at Fashion Rio, then at São Paulo Fashion Week and finally at the couture in Paris, I was no longer in the mood to be giving any designer the benefit of the doubt.Holding Berlin Fashion Week to the same standards as the couture shows clearly makes no sense, but the show audiences seemed to be confused, acting as if they were guests at an exclusive soiree in the Paris Ritz.

And it's just one in a huge rollout of lounges happening over the next several months from Washington Dulles to Bombay. At a time when most carriers are cutting back, this is also a bit of encouraging news for the dismal business of aviation. (Of course, airlines never mind spending on the premium classes - they know which side their bread is buttered on.) And sure, not a lot of people are flying first right now, but before anyone starts hating on the forward cabins, keep in mind that you can get into the new lounge if you're a Frequent Traveler (35,000 miles a year) on any Star Alliance carrier. And for those of us hopelessly stuck in the back of the plane, Lufthansa is also bringing back on-board broadband Internet access in every class.

2009-02-03T03:00:59Z,"This season, The New York Times Magazine worked behind the scenes at the Paris Haute Couture with the photographer Ellen von Unwerth. We traveled from show to show with a mini-studio -- a seamless backdrop and a couple of lights -- to create quick and dirty tableaux vivants amid the chaos of the backstage. Look for von Unwerth's photos in the Sunday Magazine in the weeks to come. In the meantime, here's how it all went down. The three-day week started out at Dior, in a tent pitched in the gardens at the Musée Rodin (where Tom Ford used to stage his collections for Yves Saint Laurent). The collection, we were informed, was inspired in part by Dutch portraiture and also by a visit to the Dior archive where John Galliano had been so struck by the construction of some of the dresses he saw that he decided to ""turn them inside out."" All was surprisingly calm backstage. As the models had their hair laced into corset-like up dos, the voluminous dresses trickled in from the atelier one by one -- each more enormous and more elaborate than the next. (They are heavy, too. When one poor woman tripped through our makeshift studio, the dress she was carrying landed right on me. I still have a huge yellow bruise.) Pat McGrath's makeup was more subdued this year -- some seasons you can hardly tell one model from the next under all the glitter and false eyelashes -- but as the show was about to begin, calm gave way to chaos. ""I'm not Olga, I'm Myf!"" a model, apparently named Myf and not Olga, exclaimed after being scolded for not getting into her proper place in the lineup."

Sandy, as he was known to everyone, was born the first of two children to Harry and Rae Davidow on November 11, 1919 in Patchogue, Long Island, NY. In the winter of 1947, he married Saundra Newman of Brooklyn, and they had three loving children, Arline, Michele and Harry. In the forties, Sandy answered his country's call to arms with the Army's 45th Regiment Thunderbirds for four years of honorable service. The war took him through four invasions and across two continents. He pushed off from North Africa, battled his way into Anzio and marched up to Munich, where he was a part of the force that liberated Dachau. Sandy was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts for his meritorious service in combat, and he received a rosary from Pope Pius XII as one of the first soldiers to enter Vatican City. He later bestowed this gift to a Catholic army brother, to whom the item held greater meaning. These actions came to define Sandy's character for friends and family. Following the war, Sandy went to St. John's Law School on the G.I. Bill and became a juris doctor in Suffolk County. Subsequently, he joined his father's law firm, founded in 1913, and it was known thereafter as Davidow & Davidow. Later in life, Sandy traveled the world, exploring far-off cultures, making new friends and connecting with distant family. He and his wife also took a winter residence in Palm Beach, FL and shared decades of fond memories with the friends they made there. When Sandy wasn't in Florida, he was at his Manhattan residence with his wife and family, enjoying the cultural offerings of Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the city's fine art museums. Sanford L. Davidow was among the last members of the Greatest Generation. He will be missed by all. Services will be held at noon on Tuesday February 3 at Temple Beth- El, 45 Oak St., in Patchogue, NY (631-475-1882) and will be followed by internment at Wellwood Cemetery on Wellwood Ave. in Pinelawn, NY (718-920-0500).

Manny was a Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in the Korean War and also served as a Major in the Reserves for 18 years. He received his B.S. from Syracuse University, where he also met wife Rhoda. In 1968, he moved the small Bronx family business begun by his father, to Greenwich, CT, and founded Shemin Nurseries, creating the nation's first ''one stop'' wholesale nursery distribution center, expanding it worldwide to over 30 distribution centers in the U.S. and Holland. Manny remained on its Board of Directors and as special consultant to the president until his death. Manny took a strong interest in encouraging development of Israel's agricultural industry to focus on high-value products competitive on world markets. With partner Dr. Issac Nir, he co-founded Genesis Seeds in the Negev, pioneering one of the largest organic seed producers in the world, literally making the desert bloom. He established an agribusiness course at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and in April 2006 was awarded the Certificate of Honor by its Agricultural Science faculty, for long-term contributions to agricultural research, and education of generations of scientists. Manny also served as an advisor to Israel's Ministry of Agriculture, including consulting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He also endowed a scholarship fund in Israel to train agriculturalists in the latest business and scientific techniques. Manny served on the Board of Trustees of Syracuse University for 16 years and on its Executive Committee for nine years. He established an entrepreneurship program for veterans at Syracuse's Whitman School of Management. He also served on the Board of Temple Sholom in Greenwich. In Florida, he and Rhoda sponsored annual Shemin Trialogue forums at Florida Atlantic University to foster communication between Christians, Muslims and Jews. He was a Trustee of the Boca Raton Museum of Art. Manny is survived by Rhoda, his wife of 57 years; his four daughters Sara Cass, Suzanne Katz, Grace Goldstein, and Leslie Lester; 10 grandchildren; and sisters Elsie Roth and Ina Bass.

Sandy, as he was known to everyone, was born the first of two children to Harry and Rae Davidow on November 11, 1919 in Patchogue, Long Island, NY. In the winter of 1947, he married Saundra Newman of Brooklyn, and they had three loving children, Arline, Michele and Harry. In the forties, Sandy answered his country's call to arms with the Army's 45th Regiment Thunderbirds for four years of honorable service. The war took him through four invasions and across two continents. He pushed off from North Africa, battled his way into Anzio and marched up to Munich, where he was a part of the force that liberated Dachau. Sandy was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts for his meritorious service in combat, and he received a rosary from Pope Pius XII as one of the first soldiers to enter Vatican City. He later bestowed this gift to a Catholic army brother, to whom the item held greater meaning. These actions came to define Sandy's character for friends and family. Following the war, Sandy went to St. John's Law School on the G.I. Bill and became a juris doctor in Suffolk County. Subsequently, he joined his father's law firm, founded in 1913, and it was known thereafter as Davidow & Davidow. Later in life, Sandy traveled the world, exploring far-off cultures, making new friends and connecting with distant family. He and his wife also took a winter residence in Palm Beach, FL and shared decades of fond memories with the friends they made there. When Sandy wasn't in Florida, he was at his Manhattan residence with his wife and family, enjoying the cultural offerings of Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the city's fine art museums. Sanford L. Davidow was among the last members of the Greatest Generation. He will be missed by all. Services will be held at noon on Tuesday February 3 at Temple Beth- El, 45 Oak St., in Patchogue, NY (631-475-1882) and will be followed by internment at Wellwood Cemetery on Wellwood Ave. in Pinelawn, NY (718-920-0500).

Hence, after a month's long political showdown, this island nation has two people claiming to be the president, two others claiming to be the capital's mayor and a population that is divided, confused and anxious."

The festival, which had scheduled Death Cab for Cutie, Snoop Dogg, Ryan Adams, Dashboard Confessional, Girl Talk, Broken Social Scene, Matisyahu and others, had been scheduled for March 6 to 8 at Bicentennial Park. ''Unfortunately, during these difficult economic times and facing a first year in a new venue, it's become apparent that we cannot execute a production that lives up to the high standards of our past events,'' Ethan Schwartz, one of the promoters, said in a statement. Other big festivals have begun making concessions to the economy; Coachella and Bonnaroo, two of the biggest, announced their new lineups recently and will offer layaway plans for tickets."

2009-02-05T00:00:00Z,"SELIGMAN--Dan, a noted writer probably best known for the popular ""Keeping Up"" column he wrote in Fortune magazine between 1976 and 1997, passed away January 31st at age 84 in Lenox Hill Hospital after a four-year battle with multiple myeloma. His humor, consideration, and integrity will be sorely missed by family and friends. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Mary ""Meg"" Seligman, whom he met when they were both working at Time, Inc., a brother, Paul, of Morristown, NJ and sister, Susan Cohn, of Maplewood, NJ, two children, Nora Favorov, a North Carolina based translator, and William Seligman, Vice President for Operations at BillMeLater, Inc., and four grandchildren. A lifelong native of Manhattan, he graduated Townsend Harris in 1941 and attended Rutgers University before enlisting in the army in 1943. His military career was short-lived due to severe asthma. He eventually graduated from New York University, where he studied under the philosopher Sidney Hook, a major influence in his life. In the late 1940s he worked for the American Mercury. He also wrote for The Commonweal and the New Leader, where he had a feature entitled ""Squinting at Labor"" that focused on Communist influence within organized labor. During this period he was an outspoken anti-communist and engaged in open polemics with the American Communist Party's mouthpiece, The Daily Worker. In 1950 he joined Fortune magazine and held a number of senior editorial positions at the magazine and its parent company, Time, Inc. In 1976 he began writing ""Keeping Up."" In 1988, when Seligman stepped down as associate managing editor of Fortune but continued contributing ""Keeping Up,"" then managing editor Marshall Loeb wrote in the magazine, ""Dan Seligman is an urbane, soft-voiced, unfailingly courteous colleague who transforms himself in these pages fortnightly into the curmudgeonly Dr. Keeping Up, an acerbic slayer of (mostly liberal) prig-headedness. In both personae, Super-Dan uses elegance and trenchant wit to wage his never-ending battle against fustian thinking, be it from overbearing bureaucrats, loony activists, or insufficiently rigorous colleagues."" In March of 1997 he left Fortune for Forbes magazine, where he was a contributing editor until 2006. He continued to write for the New York Post, Wall Street Journal and Commentary Magazine through 2007. He also contributed to City Journal, which published a memoir about the poker game he founded with two Fortune colleagues in 1953. He hosted and organized the game until shortly before his death. The game was high stakes and in a single 1958 session he himself lost 10 percent of his $16,000 salary. Among the players over the years were Irving Kristol, co-founder of The Public Interest, Chester Davis, Howard Hughes's chief trial attorney, and Victor Mitchell, the Grand Life Master bridge player. Mitchell left the game shortly after joining it, when his four-of-a-kind was beaten by a straight flush in seven card stud. Seligman, a whiz at calculating probabilities, determined that the chance of this happening was about 2.5 million to 1. He had a life-long interest in questions surrounding intelligence, genetics, and the taboos imposed on open discussion of their interplay. In 1992 he published A Question of Intelligence: The IQ Debate in America, an overview of intelligence testing that argues its usefulness.

2009-02-05T00:00:00Z,"BARRING the compulsion to sniff everything in sight, dogs usually love going hiking for the same reasons that humans do. There's the mental stimulation of traversing a complicated trail, the physical benefits of brisk exercise at changing inclines and, of course, the plain old fun of being in the great outdoors. To facilitate canine hiking expeditions, a vast array of gear has been introduced in recent years, including backpacks, leashes, harnesses, coats, boots, bowls, beds and tents designed especially for dogs, for their paws and their comfort, on the trails. ''There was a time when it was difficult to get dog hiking gear,'' said Linda B. Mullally, the author of ''Hiking With Dogs: Becoming a Wilderness-Wise Dog Owner,'' and an especially firm advocate of dog hiking boots, among other products. ''Now it's become a bit of a snazzy fashion industry, and you have to be careful to select things that are actually comfortable and functional for the dog.'' Samantha Lewis, the owner of the dog walking and hiking service Lewis & Bark in Los Angeles, takes her canine clients trekking in the Santa Monica Mountains every weekday afternoon. With the help of Spotty, her 11-year-old Dalmatian, and a couple of friends -- Honey, a 6-year-old Australian shepherd and Auggie, a 2-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback -- she tested five kinds of outdoor dog gear on the Sullivan Canyon Trail near Brentwood, evaluating them for construction, practicality, ease of use and comfort. She liked elements of each item, even if Spotty sometimes seemed less sure. JENNIFER BLEYER"

2009-02-06T00:00:00Z,"WOODBURY--Nathalie Ferris Sampson, of Shutesbury, died December 22 at home after a long illness. She leaves her husband, Richard B. Woodbury and loving friends. Nathalie was born in Humboldt, Arizona in 1918, where she began formal schooling in the sixth grade, and grew into a widely respected scholar and writer. A woman of strong opinions and wit, she delighted in dogs and other animals, which surrounded her at her Shutesbury home. She was an honorary life member of the Nature Conservancy, honorary dog officer of Shutesbury; and a valued supporter of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her home on the edge of an extensive woodland provided many opportunities to observe wildlife. She attended Barnard College in New York, received her BA degree there in 1939, and pursued graduate studies in Anthropology at Columbia University. She devoted her adult life to the study of human society, languages, and culture in various manifestations, and was the co-author and editor of several volumes in various anthropological sub-disciplines. She married archaeologist Richard Benjamin Woodbury in 1948, and shared field work with him in Mexico, Arizona and New Mexico. The two held museum posts, together and severally in Arizona, New York, and the Smithsonian Institution. In her long career, Nathalie taught at Barnard College, Brooklyn College, Eastern New Mexico College, and the Universities of Arizona and Kentucky. At Barnard she also held administrative positions. In the course of her career she became widely acquainted within the professional ranks of Anthropology and Archaeology, and was universally respected. She was very skillful at editing and authoring, leading to various professional positions. She was editor of several newsletters, contributed a regular column for the Anthropology Newsletter, entitled ""Past is Present,"" and organized and sometimes wrote obituaries for the Newsletter. She was a regular contributor to professional programs, annual reports, and guides. The renown that followed her services led to positions on the Board of the American Anthropological Association, the Society for American Archaeology, and the American Ethnological Society. She edited the internationally respected professional journals for the Society for American Archaeology and the American Anthropological Association. With this background, it is not surprising that she chose anthropologists as 'her people' to study and report. She easily recognized that the familiar was not always well understood, and the exotic was not necessarily foreign. She delighted in 'problem solving' in real world situations, and was able to contribute significantly by applying those skills. Equally adept close to home, she served in town government in Shutesbury as a Selectperson and on the board of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her skills and vision led her into advocating for a strong executive for the American Anthropological Association. She was instrumental in hiring a business specialist, and watched with deep satisfaction as he drew the Association into fiscal soundness and executive order. Nat was a natural networker. She cared about and maintained close mentoring relationships with former students she had taught at Barnard, Eastern New Mexico, Arizona, and Kentucky. The profession was enriched by their training and skills. At annual professional meetings, she conferred with colleagues and students at luncheons; these relationships frequently blossomed into lifelong friendships. Nathalie and Richard Woodbury were recognized jointly and severally for their significant services for the town and their professional societies. Awards for Distinguished Service were presented by the American Anthropological Association and the Society for American Archaeology. The town of Shutesbury recognized their joint services with a plaque. Close to retirement, Nathalie asked a rhetorical question that sums up a significant career remarkably well: ""Am I an archaeologist or a sociocultural anthropologist?...., an educator, an administrator, or a small town politician?"" She was all of those, and everyone who knew her recognized her gifts and was grateful. Donations in her memory may be made to the Dakin Pioneer Valley Humane Society, P.O. Box 319, South Deerfield, MA 01303. Obituary and register at www.douglassfuneral.com."
2009-02-06T00:00:00Z,"IT'S not difficult to stay entertained on Maui. View the sunrise from the top of the 10,000-foot volcano Haleakala and then take an exhilarating 38-mile bicycle ride down the mountain with no pedaling. Drive the winding, cliff-hugging, hairpin-turn Road to Hana along Maui's tropical northeast shoreline, where each bend yields a view from the car windows more breathtaking than the last. Take a sailboat ride out to the half-sunken crater island of Molokini and do some scuba diving in its crescent-shaped bay. My wife, teenage daughter and son, and I did all of the above on a family trip to Maui last year, and enjoyed each experience, but the activity we loved best was simple, required no reservations and came free of cost: snorkeling. We found a succession of spectacular beaches in the south Maui towns of Wailea and Makena where snorkelers can see dozens of species of fish and coral in relatively protected waters. Without our really intending it, our vacation became a snorkeling adventure."

The most important thing is to keep the quality of the cheese together. But that has to be all from your head, just when you handle it, you know what you're doing. Cheese matures differently, it gets either hard or soft. It's a very wonderful cheese, it's a very healthy cheese, because our cheese comes from cow's milk, and cow's milk is nearest to mother's milk."

The proposal could increase ticket prices by about 8 percent, which could dim Broadway's lights as tourists start thinking twice about that vacation in Manhattan. If tourism slumps in the city, the state's budget problems would surely worsen along with it.

2009-02-06T00:00:00Z,"THE New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, a leader in promoting public health, has embarked on a campaign to persuade the makers of processed food to reduce its salt content by more than 40 percent over the next 10 years. The goal is commendable: to prevent strokes and heart attacks. And the premise is logical: if people eat less salt, they'll have lower blood pressure, and this could translate into better cardiovascular health. If such a large reduction were actually to be achieved, however, New Yorkers would consume less sodium than people in most other developed countries do. And there is a possibility that such a big change in one element of their diet might have unintended harmful consequences. Prudence requires that logic and good intentions also be supported by strong evidence that such an action would be safe."

2009-02-06T00:00:00Z,"WOODBURY--Nathalie Ferris Sampson, of Shutesbury, died December 22 at home after a long illness. She leaves her husband, Richard B. Woodbury and loving friends. Nathalie was born in Humboldt, Arizona in 1918, where she began formal schooling in the sixth grade, and grew into a widely respected scholar and writer. A woman of strong opinions and wit, she delighted in dogs and other animals, which surrounded her at her Shutesbury home. She was an honorary life member of the Nature Conservancy, honorary dog officer of Shutesbury; and a valued supporter of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her home on the edge of an extensive woodland provided many opportunities to observe wildlife. She attended Barnard College in New York, received her BA degree there in 1939, and pursued graduate studies in Anthropology at Columbia University. She devoted her adult life to the study of human society, languages, and culture in various manifestations, and was the co-author and editor of several volumes in various anthropological sub-disciplines. She married archaeologist Richard Benjamin Woodbury in 1948, and shared field work with him in Mexico, Arizona and New Mexico. The two held museum posts, together and severally in Arizona, New York, and the Smithsonian Institution. In her long career, Nathalie taught at Barnard College, Brooklyn College, Eastern New Mexico College, and the Universities of Arizona and Kentucky. At Barnard she also held administrative positions. In the course of her career she became widely acquainted within the professional ranks of Anthropology and Archaeology, and was universally respected. She was very skillful at editing and authoring, leading to various professional positions. She was editor of several newsletters, contributed a regular column for the Anthropology Newsletter, entitled ""Past is Present,"" and organized and sometimes wrote obituaries for the Newsletter. She was a regular contributor to professional programs, annual reports, and guides. The renown that followed her services led to positions on the Board of the American Anthropological Association, the Society for American Archaeology, and the American Ethnological Society. She edited the internationally respected professional journals for the Society for American Archaeology and the American Anthropological Association. With this background, it is not surprising that she chose anthropologists as 'her people' to study and report. She easily recognized that the familiar was not always well understood, and the exotic was not necessarily foreign. She delighted in 'problem solving' in real world situations, and was able to contribute significantly by applying those skills. Equally adept close to home, she served in town government in Shutesbury as a Selectperson and on the board of the Dakin Animal Shelter. Her skills and vision led her into advocating for a strong executive for the American Anthropological Association. She was instrumental in hiring a business specialist, and watched with deep satisfaction as he drew the Association into fiscal soundness and executive order. Nat was a natural networker. She cared about and maintained close mentoring relationships with former students she had taught at Barnard, Eastern New Mexico, Arizona, and Kentucky. The profession was enriched by their training and skills. At annual professional meetings, she conferred with colleagues and students at luncheons; these relationships frequently blossomed into lifelong friendships. Nathalie and Richard Woodbury were recognized jointly and severally for their significant services for the town and their professional societies. Awards for Distinguished Service were presented by the American Anthropological Association and the Society for American Archaeology. The town of Shutesbury recognized their joint services with a plaque. Close to retirement, Nathalie asked a rhetorical question that sums up a significant career remarkably well: ""Am I an archaeologist or a sociocultural anthropologist?...., an educator, an administrator, or a small town politician?"" She was all of those, and everyone who knew her recognized her gifts and was grateful. Donations in her memory may be made to the Dakin Pioneer Valley Humane Society, P.O. Box 319, South Deerfield, MA 01303. Obituary and register at www.douglassfuneral.com."

2009-02-06T00:00:00Z,"When the South Dakota State women's basketball team moved to Division I four seasons ago, it brought along a devoted following that had kept it among the national leaders in Division II attendance for almost a decade. Still, it was hard to imagine the Jackrabbits becoming the biggest show in town. It took only one season of Division I play for the Jackrabbits to start outdrawing the men's team. Now, the 21-2 Jackrabbits are no longer a regional secret. They keep knocking off bigger-name colleges and have been bobbing in and out of the top 25 in the Associated Press poll, rarefied air for a team from the Summit League. On Saturday, the Jackrabbits defeated Oakland University, 88-75, before a crowd of 5,637, the ninth largest in Frost Arena history and the most for any basketball game on campus this season. A week earlier, 4,491 walked through snow and braved below-zero wind chills to watch a 64-48 victory against archrival North Dakota State, about 800 more than the men's game with the same opponent the night before."

2009-02-07T00:00:00Z,"With the Senate on track to pass its version of the economic stimulus legislation, President Obama is widely expected to win final Congressional approval of the plan soon, and thus make good on an assortment of his campaign promises. But in the process, he is confronting the impediments to his most ambitious pledge: to end the capital's partisan warfare. Mr. Obama has been frustrated by an array of forces, from an often bitter and personal history of partisanship on Capitol Hill to the near-extinction of Republican moderates in the House to the deep ideological gulf between the parties on economic policy. And as his aspiration of putting aside petty politics has met the necessity of winning legislative votes -- no more than two or three Senate Republicans are expected to support him, which is two or three more than did so in the House -- he has gone through a public evolution that has left him showing sharper edges when it comes to the ways of Washington."

2009-02-08T00:00:00Z,"Because of an editing error, excerpts of an interview last Sunday with the artist Emily Jacir erroneously attributed part of a quotation to her when she was asked about Wael Zuaiter, a Palestinian intellectual whose killing in 1972 inspired one of Ms. Jacir’s works. She was quoting the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia when she said in the interview, conducted by e-mail, that Mr. Zuaiter’s “dominant characteristic was his sheer benevolence towards everyone and everything. This seemed to me a rare and precious quality, especially when I remembered that he was Palestinian and therefore had many reasons for allowing himself to resort to violence.

He has apparently never visited the Michigan Central Station in Detroit (below). It’s a grand Beaux-Arts, neo-Classical palace designed in 1913 by Warren & Wetmore and Reed & Stem, the same architectural firms that designed Grand Central Terminal. Since it closed over 20 years ago, the station has sat abandoned and in ruins. If Oakland’s new station is a “shed,” Detroit’s is a shack. In Detroit, the contrast between the old and the new as an illustration of the demise of rail travel in this country is truly breathtaking."

I saw the need for underwear that is both high-quality and comfortable, and still very sexy.'' The year-old label, which just became available in the United States, includes modern, clean-lined pieces with intelligent hints of sex appeal: high-waist briefs that arch into a thong in back, balconette bras with slinky straps, and delicately structured camisoles -- all cut from superfine organic cotton and silk jersey, produced by Mr. Jaschke's family business.

Born in Vienna, Austria, he came to New York City when he was fourteen, and excelled in his academic pursuits at New York University and New York Law School. In 1947, a few years after graduating law school he became a single practitioner and in 1951 started his own law firm, Green & Ettinger, with his friend Joseph Ettinger. He was a practicing attorney for nearly 65 years and loved his work. The New York County Lawyers Association honored him recently as the second longest-standing member since he joined in 1944. In addition to his law practice, Paul owned and managed real estate throughout the United States. He was a superb dealmaker, negotiator and advisor, and many of his clients and partners became his closest friends. All his life, Paul had an intense interest in history, politics and geography. He was an avid learner and a gifted teacher. He was also a member of NYCLA's Real Property Section for over 20 years and Secretary of NYCLA's Committee on Professional Discipline since 1991. In addition to his many legal committees, Paul was a longtime Trustee at Beth Israel Hospital. Funeral Services will be held on Sunday, February 8, 2009 at 11:30am at Frank Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street, New York, NY 10028.

I'm sure many athletes would say they would love to be just a student -- to sleep in, go to class, work for a few hours, and then spend time with their peers at school functions and activities.

2009-02-08T00:00:00Z,"FULFORD--David. Leading Summer Stock Director and Producer David Fulford, a leading force in Summer Theater in its heyday from the mid 1950s to the mid 1980s died in New York City on January 20, 2009. He was 83 year old. In 1954, Mr. Fulford started a small summer stock company in an old barn in Canal Fulton, Ohio. Hiring young New York actors in his first season, he soon discovered that one needed name actors to attract audiences, so, working through Hollywood agents, he began hiring an older generation of film and television stars such as Van Johnson, Betty Grable, Nanette Fabray, George Hamilton and Mickey Rooney. As opposed to the 'star package' policy of other summer theaters, he engaged stars on an individual basis, produced a play of their choice and cast the secondary roles with members of his company. So successful was this plan, he soon abandoned his barn and built, also in Canal Fulton, a state of the art theater, complete with swimming pool. He also opened the Carousel Dinner Theater in 1976 in Ravenna, Ohio, where he produced popular musicals of the day. Mr. Fulford produced and directed three major Off-Broadway productions <-- ""Moon in the Yellow River"", ""Colombe"" and ""Fashion"", starring Will Greer and Enid Markey, which won the Vernon Rice Award in 1959. He ventured into the film industry directing and writing the screen plays ""Excuse Me For Living"", ""The Prince of Terror"" and ""The Haunted Mansion"". Charles David Fulford was born in Newport News, Virginia, on August 31, 1925, and grew up in Barberton, Ohio. He served as a Navy Ensign in WWII and as a Naval Lieutenant in the Korean War. He attended the Yale Drama School, Carnegie-Mellon University and graduated from the New School for Social Research where he subsequently taught ""Introduction to Voice Over"" from 1989 to the end of 2008. After retiring from his summer stock career, he returned to his first profession of acting, studying with Uta Hagen and appearing in several Off-Off- Broadway plays. Mr. Fulford is survived by long time companions Everett Susco of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and Patricia O'Grady of New York City; niece Nancy Thrams of Cleveland, Ohio; and nephews Guy Thrams of Lexington, Ohio and Benjamin Thrams of Mansfield, Ohio."

But after Countrywide collapsed, and more than 12,000 people lost their jobs and many more lost their life savings, Mr. Mozilo was a pariah. How could he stand to make $110 million in total severance (later reduced) after driving the nation's largest home lender into the ground? Class resentment, like race, is always there in American life, though often smothered by the surface calm of good times. It was considered unfashionable, or worse, to point out that by 2006 total compensation for chief executives of the largest companies was 364 times that of the pay of the average worker, a nearly tenfold increase in the salary gap over 30 years."

2009-02-08T00:00:00Z,"CONVINCED that seasonal dressing is a thing of the past, the Bottega Veneta designer Tomas Maier opened his spring collection with a series of leather pieces: a pinafore, a T-shirt, a paper-bag-waist skirt in warm saffrons and chestnut. This was his idea of investment dressing (that skirt? $5,700); and from the looks of the spring runways, he was not alone. Leather, in its many incarnations, showed up at Marc Jacobs, Proenza Schouler, Rodarte and Givenchy. And though it all looked cool, the skirts in particular seemed the most practical. Wear them with tights and a fitted sweater now; bare legs and a T-shirt in spring. ''There are so many things you can do with leather,'' said Camilla Staerk, who incorporates it into each of her collections. ''That's the reason why I love it. It's something you can easily make hard, and something that can have a soft, feminine feel as well.''"

''My mom passed away last March, and since I usually go home to Ireland to spend Christmas with her, I needed to do something totally different. So I Googled 'remote undeveloped Caribbean island,' and this is what I came up with -- honestly, true story. I've always traveled with friends or girlfriends who need to see everything, who really need to digest the destination. I found it all too tiring, because New York is so exhausting every day. I always fantasized about going somewhere where I could sit alone. So I did a lot of sitting in Dominica. At the springs, bamboo pipes channel the hot water from the side of the mountain into the cast-iron tubs. All the bathtubs are vintage -- probably not a word they use in Dominica -- but they're really ancient, I would imagine from old plantation homes or other old-style homes. The water has a bit of a metallic taste. I don't know if it's from the mineral salts or from the tub, I have really no clue.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

In 1968, he moved the small Bronx family business begun by his father, to Greenwich, CT, and founded Shemin Nurseries, creating the nation's first ''one stop'' wholesale nursery distribution center, expanding it worldwide to over 30 distribution centers in the U.S. and Holland. Manny remained on its Board of Directors and as special consultant to the president until his death. Manny took a strong interest in encouraging development of Israel's agricultural industry to focus on high-value products competitive on world markets. With partner Dr. Issac Nir, he co-founded Genesis Seeds in the Negev, pioneering one of the largest organic seed producers in the world, literally making the desert bloom. He established an agribusiness course at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and in April 2006 was awarded the Certificate of Honor by its Agricultural Science faculty, for long-term contributions to agricultural research, and education of generations of scientists. Manny also served as an advisor to Israel's Ministry of Agriculture, including consulting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He also endowed a scholarship fund in Israel to train agriculturalists in the latest business and scientific techniques. Manny served on the Board of Trustees of Syracuse University for 16 years and on its Executive Committee for nine years. He established an entrepreneurship program for veterans at Syracuse's Whitman School of Management. He also served on the Board of Temple Sholom in Greenwich. In Florida, he and Rhoda sponsored annual Shemin Trialogue forums at Florida Atlantic University to foster communication between Christians, Muslims and Jews. He was a Trustee of the Boca Raton Museum of Art. Manny is survived by Rhoda, his wife of 57 years; his four daughters Sara Cass, Suzanne Katz, Grace Goldstein, and Leslie Lester; 10 grandchildren; and sisters Elsie Roth and Ina Bass. Donations in his memory can be made to Johns Hopkins, Kimmel Cancer Center Leukemia Program, Attn: Ellen Stifler, 100 North Charles St., Suite 234, Baltimore, MD 21201"

Founded in 1951 by André Bazin, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze and Joseph-Marie Lo Duca and edited by Eric Rohmer, Cahiers du Cinéma was a crucible for writers-turned-New Wave directors like Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, and a vocal advocate of filmmakers including Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Jean Renoir and Jean Cocteau. In 1988 its parent company was acquired by the newspaper Le Monde, leading to a much-criticized makeover of the magazine in 1999; in April, Le Monde said it would seek a new owner for Cahiers du Cinéma as part of a corporate reorganization. In addition to acquiring the monthly magazine, Phaidon Press said it would also take over the book publishing division of Cahiers du Cinéma."

Last week, a California state judge refused to issue an injunction or restraining order preventing a new executive director and chief negotiator from taking office or negotiating on the union’s behalf with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major Hollywood studios.

The 185-year-old Moscow theater, home to both the Bolshoi Ballet and Bolshoi Opera, closed in July 2005 to undergo massive restorations to its structure, its orchestra and backstage facilities; at the time, the Bolshoi anticipated that work would be completed by 2008. But Russia’s culture minister, Aleksandr Avdeyev, said the renovations now would not be finished until the middle of 2011, after contractors were hired “because they were inexpensive rather than high quality,” according to The Guardian. Mr. Avdeyev also said that the installation of a stage hydraulics system would take longer than originally expected. But Nikita Shangin, the former chief architect of the renovation, said that previously announced completion dates were “all bluff and politics,” according to The Guardian, adding: “I always believed it would take a lot longer.”"

This was where we decided to devote our professional lives to studying art, and to helping others feel the excitement we had discovered in these galleries.’’ The three added: “We can only hope that Brandeis will now revisit its decision.

But I found myself thinking about the city again today, after looking at a lovely slide show produced by my colleagues on the Travel desk about the Venetian Carnevale, the 10-day masked extravaganza that starts this Saturday. I have something of a love-hate relationship with Venice. There are few places on the planet where I have been quite so thrilled by art, and of course the sheer unlikelihood of the place, the gorgeous fantastical quality of it, cannot but mesmerize, no matter how many times you've seen it. Then again, I wish it were easier to have a great meal there (don't get me wrong, I've eaten very well in Venice, but I do find this more of a challenge than in other Italian cities), and I always find the place a bit creepy at night, when the sudden and near-total emptiness of the streets can give the feeling of being locked in a museum after closing. As amusing as I'm sure Carnevale is - and I suppose the streets are plenty lively after dark then - my aversion to crowds means I'd never dream of going for the festival. No, I prefer Venice as it was on my first visit, one gray, cold and misty November. My companion and I ditched our guidebook, and we simply wandered the quiet, fog-shrouded streets. And in that atmosphere the city felt not like some commercialized tourist trap but rather a place of romance and mystery, of unexpected beauty down obscure lanes and great possibilities for discovery every time we stopped studying the map and just allowed ourselves to get lost."

2009-02-10T00:00:00Z,"How sweet it is! The American diet, that is. While the current recommendation is a maximum intake of eight teaspoons of sugars a day, one 12-ounce can of regular soda (or a 20-ounce bottle of VitaminWater) delivers eight or nine teaspoons. That means you are at or over the limit before you've eaten a single cookie or container of fruit-flavored yogurt, or even some commercial tomato soups or salad dressings with added sugars. The result is an average daily intake of more than 20 teaspoons of sweet calories. Although much fuss has been raised about high-fructose corn syrup, when it comes to calories and weight gain, it makes no difference if the sweetener was derived from corn, sugar cane, beets or fruit juice concentrate. All contain a combination of fructose and glucose and, gram for gram, supply the same number of calories. All contribute to the excessive caloric intake that has resulted in an epidemic of obesity among Americans in the last 25 years."

2009-02-10T00:00:00Z,"ARTON--Dolores M.,of Greenwich, CT died suddenly on February 6, 2009, surrounded by her loving family at Greenwich Hospital. Dolores moved to Greenwich in 2002 from New York City. Dolores and her identical twin sister Katherine were born on July 31, 1957 in Lansdale, Pennsylvania to the late Catherine (Cummings) and Harry Arton. She is survived by her sisters Katherine Arton and Elizabeth Dyevich of Princeton, New Jersey, Mary Cooper of Greenwich, CT, and Patricia Arton of Stamford, CT. She is also survived by her brothers- in-law James Cooper of Greenwich, CT, Thomas Dyevich of Princeton, NJ and her six adored nieces and nephews, Henry, Michael, and Kate Cooper of Greenwich, CT, and Jack, Harry, and Catherine Dyevich of Princeton, NJ. Dolores was Principal and Chief Financial Officer of Founder's Equity, a private equity firm in Manhattan. Prior to joining Founders, Dolores served as a Director in Citibank's Investment Banking Division, and PaineWebber's Investment Banking Group. She began her career at Grant Thornton, where she received her C.P.A., and subsequently joined First Pennsylvania National Bank. She received her M.B.A. from Columbia University and a B.A. from Temple University. Dolores was the guiding compass to her entire family. Her nieces and nephews were the shining light of her life; she loved them with the most beautiful unconditional love imaginable. Dolores stepped in and became a mother to her two youngest sisters after their mother's death. She was a cherished sister, aunt, cousin, niece, friend and colleague. She touched many lives, working as a mentor to countless young students and business professionals. Dolores was never too busy to help anyone who crossed her path. Dolores's modesty about her many accomplishments impressed all who knew her. She inherited her boundless energy and passion for adventure and world travel from her beloved father. Dolores held dearly her beloved mother's belief that all people, regardless of their status, deserved respect and dignity. She inherited both parents' adoration for animals, and continued their tradition of supporting animal welfare. She was a pet therapy volunteer with her cocker spaniel, Dudley. Dolores had recently returned from Russia, where she met the beautiful girl who was soon to become her adopted daughter. We miss her terribly, but take great comfort and solace in knowing that her indomitable spirit will live on forever in all of us. Her final act of love was to be an organ donor. Many people will be able to live normal lives as a result of her. Visitation will be held from 8:30 to 9:30am, on Wednesday February 11th at the Leo P. Gallagher & Son Funeral Home, 31 Arch Street, Greenwich, CT. The funeral services will be at 10am, at Saint Mary Church, 178 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich, CT.

There's a hotel in Santa Fe, N.M., with a package that includes ""passionate fruit cocktail"" and ""red incense to burn."" Canned pineapple and patchouli ... yeah, that's hot. Another hotel, in Austin, Tex., provides a classical violinist to ruin - I mean accompany - your dinner for two. And I've lost count of the number of times I've seen some variation on the theme of champagne and strawberries. That tired old couple can't possibly feel sexy any more, can they? Of course some ""deals"" really are deals, but please, hotel execs, don't try to convince us that ""two terry-cloth bathrobes"" is something to get excited about. And pretty please with a strawberry on top, don't try to sell us a weekend of chocolate massages (yuck) for $14,000, as in the case of one major Hawaiian resort. Upgrade me to a suite - now that's a turn-on. Our friend The Frugal Traveler over at The New York Times travel section has a keener eye on Valentine's Day specials than I do; he did a good post the other day listing some of the better offers. But he didn't include my favorite, the Fairmont San Francisco's Break-Up package for the newly single. Among the usual cookies and bubbly is a chance to buy jewelry wholesale - plus a $100 gift certificate - at Padis Gems. It's $250 a night, which is actually a few bucks cheaper than a regular night, and San Francisco is a great city to be single in. If I were, I'd be there."

Not that sobriety has too much traction in either: when I returned to St. Petersburg in 2003 for the first time in 20 years, it was much more common to find open beers in the morning crowd than cups of coffee. And in the extravagant cabarets of Brighton Beach ― those gilded mafiya haunts now frequented by well-heeled families from Montclair and Stamford ― each dinner table is marked by an endless cavalcade of Smirnoff and Courvoisier.The notion that Russians love to drink is true, but somewhat misses the point. Russians love abundance, and alcohol ― especially vodka ― has been one of the few steady pleasures in a nation historically steeped in war, poverty and unrest. During the Soviet era, vodka promised a sanctuary from Marxism-Leninism: ideology does not exist at the bottom of a shot glass. Mikhail Gorbachev must have forgotten that when he launched his misguided anti-alcohol campaign during the bleak mid-80s as the Soviet dream was on the verge of unraveling. The historian William Pokhlebkin, in his ""A History of Vodka,"" an amusingly thorough account of Russia's love affair with ""the little water,"" writes: ""The clumsy prohibitionist measures taken against vodka were not only ineffective but contributed to the disruption of state finances."" When vodka became scarce, many resorted to making their own, known as samogon, which sapped the nation of its sugar reserves and further enraged the thirsty populace, as there was now nothing to sweeten tea."

Many designers are staging small shows, which I think makes sense anyway. A number of fashion chiefs in Paris told me last month: ""This year has already been written off."""

2009-02-12T10:38:19Z,"The Valentina exhibition opens tonight at the Museum of the City of New York, and yesterday I dropped by for a little preview with curators Kohle Yohannan and Phyllis Magidson. They were up to their mannequins, so to speak, in dresses. It is going to be a remarkable, talked-about exhibit. For one thing, the simplicity and innovation of Valentina's clothes will remind people of the 1930s and 40s, and it might put them in a better frame of mind for these hard times. Valentina accomplished so much with her hands, her mind and her personality, which was complemented by her severe beauty. She was stark raving mad, according to some. She was certainly a member of the progressive 20th century. That's the thought that stayed with me as I looked at her wrap-and-tie dresses, her shapely boleros and spare ballerina skirts-how far-sighted she was. And sophisticated. I can imagine that a few designers will gaze at the pieces and think, Boy, can I get the pattern for that? And to look at the colors of her dresses-the distinct shades of plum, mulberry, midnight blue, smoke brown-is to wonder if we have not become color blind. We seem definitely poorer people today without that kind of subtle palette."

The group is negotiating with other dance studio operators to take over the lease, Mr. Preston said, but there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached. Meanwhile, New Dance Group’s board will continue to function and seek to raise money to preserve its archives digitally and to mount exhibits. “We hope to set a model for other organizations going forward,” Mr. Preston said. “It’s a web 2.0 New Dance Group.” The group outfit was founded in the Depression and provided inexpensive lessons. Choreographers associated with it produced important works, many of them with a populist and activist bent. New Dance Group also sponsored a company, but that arm has been moribund for the past several years."

(Thunder will even get to celebrate at her after-party since Monday's a school holiday.) While her mom's painting and collage images often feature half-naked nymphs, Thunder's subject matter is strictly G-rated. Still, both artists find their inspiration in the fast-paced pop culture that surrounds them: Mom has found her muses in New York's grittier downtown scene and Kate Moss, daughter looks to Japanese anime and the ""Twilight"" series. Along with her sketches of wide-eyed goth girls and Silly String installations, Thunder has spray-painted and plastered the wall with mashups of magazine cutouts. ""It looks really funny,"" says Thunder, who invited a friend to help ""decorate"" this tween fantasy romper room. The art has a sweet poutiness to it, but the prices are nothing to sulk about."

Today, Ms. Dargis writes about ""Gomorrah,"" an Italian film that demonstrates how the Comorra, the Neopolitan mafia, slithers into almost all aspects of everyday life."

2009-02-13T11:45:40Z,What we're looking at on the Web today ...
2009-02-13T11:40:43Z,"Other Oscar bloggers are more experienced (like Tom O'Neil), more beloved (Sasha Stone) or more schooled in cinema (Kris Tapley), but none of them gets invited every year to an Oscar party in Sweden. Each year, Christina Jeurling makes sure that the Bagger receives a lovely handcrafted invite. In the year ""Departed"" won, there was a lovely take on Martin Scorsese as a kind of puppet/action figure, last year's was a mobile that used some strike-themed art, and this year's design is an electoral motif with amazing little custom buttons for each best picture nominee."

The praise is widespread, ranging from Jim Boeheim (""He changes the game."") to Jim Calhoun (""He has a regal sense about him."")Although some fans have started worrying that the Huskies are being disrespected, respect is probably not UConn's biggest worry now, with the loss of Jerome Dyson.

2009-02-13T11:02:34Z,"The Bagger put on his curmudgeon suit yesterday and sprayed some bad attitude about this year's Oscars. But in a year when the Super Bowl scored excellent numbers, the Grammys did better than expected, and movie attendance is up significantly, who is to say that the show of shows might not have a little bounce in the ratings? At a time when there is bad news on every horizon, gathering around the tube for a little Oscar song and dance might sound just right."

2009-02-13T10:40:01Z,"There are few Oscar savants more stalwart or respected than Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly, and he is a particular favorite this time of year because his weekly deadlines compel him to do his picking ahead of time. Mr. Karger is going with a ""Slumdog Millionaire"" sweep of seven awards, including picture, director, adapted screenplay, cinematography, editing, song and score. He's picking Kate Winslet and Sean Penn for lead actors, and Penelope Cruz and Heath Ledger in the supporting category. The Bagger, who doesn't have to lock his picks until next Thursday, is in basic agreement, although he is leaning toward Mickey Rourke in actor and Viola Davis in the supporting female category. This is actually starting to get fun."

It is certainly loyal, but women, whether they are homemakers with children or women with demanding careers, have been relying on specialty stores and personal shoppers for years. Alex A, I appreciate your account from Chicago. Most of us who follow fashion have had the good fortunate to know a lot of savvy retailers. Off the top of my head: Hattie Belkin, Linda Dresner and Lynn Portnoy from Detroit; the late Lynn Manulis of Martha; Ron Herman in L.A. and the super-smart Nina Garduno; Katy and Matthew Culmo in Austin, and of course Marilyn Blaszka and Dominic Marcheschi at Blake in Chicago."

2009-02-13T10:22:03Z,"Joaquin Phoenix's addled appearance on ""Late Show With David Letterman"" the other night probably didn't do his already corroded public image much good, even if it is all a hoax.

Better brace for a third, he says. And this time, it's not just low-wage workers losing their jobs, but modernizers and leading industrialists.

2009-02-13T08:05:23Z,"By any measure, money for mass-transit agencies seems to be a fine form of stimulus. Many local agencies are now facing budget shortfalls, leading them to raise fares, cut services and lay off workers. If the federal government sent money to these agencies, it would prevent some job cuts -- serving as a quick form of stimulus, since a job not lost is just as good as one created. Money for mass transit would also make it easier for low-income workers, who are so far bearing the brunt of the recession, to get to their jobs or to search for new ones."

Ted Strickland spared the life of a death row inmate who killed his mother in a cocaine-induced rage and whose scheduled execution was opposed by his family, including his mother’s siblings. The inmate, Jeffrey Hill, 44, had been scheduled to die March 3. But Mr. Strickland said he agreed with the Ohio Parole Board, which recommended last week that Mr. Hill not be put to death and should eventually be released from prison. Mr. Hill stabbed his mother, Emma Hill, to death in 1991. As she lay dying in her Cincinnati apartment, he took $20 from her to spend on drugs, returning later to take $80. Mr. Hill’s family said they had suffered enough and that putting him to death would only make matters worse."
2009-02-13T00:00:00Z,"The Justice Department indicated that it was not backing away from the argument used by the Bush administration that courts should use national security concerns to block a lawsuit brought by an Islamic group that says its rights had been violated. Department lawyers filed papers with a Federal District Court in San Francisco asking for a stay in a judge’s ruling that the “state secrets” doctrine could not be used in the Islamic group’s lawsuit. The group, al-Haramain, has argued that its officers and lawyers were illegally wiretapped in a secret surveillance program by the National Security Administration. The Justice Department under President Bush invoked the state secrets doctrine in asking the court to dismiss the case."

(The results appear this weekend in The New York Times Magazine and on one of our two new home pages.) Extreme fashion finery such as Proenza Schouler's disco ball jumpsuit, Marc Jacobs's Mary Poppins ensembles and Rodarte's shredded bondage dresses often prompt the question, ""Where would I possibly wear that?"" -- except maybe in the pages of a magazine. But these spring showstoppers looked remarkably at home in what Christensen described as one of the most unforgettable cities she's ever encountered. Of course, the St. Roch neighborhood where the shoot mostly took place is fairly unforgettable even by New Orleans standards. Here, Kirsha Kaechele has been transforming derelict cottages and other ramshackle sites into living works of art.

The original Broadway production of &#8220;The Gin Game&#8221; in 1977 was directed by Mike Nichols, and a revival in 1997 was directed by Charles Nelson Reilly. The original Broadway production of &#8220;The Shadow Box,&#8221; also in 1977, was directed by Gordon Davidson; a 1994 revival was directed by Jack Hofsiss. Arvin Brown, one of Mr. Anderson&#8217;s directors, did not direct Broadway productions of either play.

Governors are to channel most of that money to school districts and colleges, to avert teacher layoffs. They may also use some of it to modernize school buildings."

2009-02-14T00:00:00Z,"Roughly $282 billion of the stimulus package, or about 35 percent, is made up of tax cuts for individuals and businesses, including tax breaks for buyers of homes and cars. The centerpiece is President Obama's ''Making Work Pay'' income tax credit of up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples in 2009 and 2010. The money will mostly be distributed through reduced paycheck tax withholdings, adding $8 or so a week that officials hope will be spent not saved.

The bill also provides more than $10 billion to modernize the electricity grid and install ''smart'' meters in homes and as much as $20 billion in tax incentives for wind, solar, hydro and other renewable power sources.

2009-02-14T00:00:00Z,"A provision buried deep inside the $787 billion economic stimulus bill would impose restrictions on executive bonuses at financial institutions that are much tougher than those proposed 10 days ago by the Treasury Department. The provision, inserted by Senate Democrats over the objections of the Obama administration, is aimed at companies that have received financial bailout funds. It would prohibit cash bonuses and almost all other incentive compensation for the five most senior officers and the 20 highest-paid executives at large companies that receive money under the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP."

Supporters say the missions coincide, since poor people are quick to spend. Opponents see a backdoor expansion of welfare. The package provides an extra $20 billion for food stamps over several years. For the average family of three, that means a 19 percent increase this year, or an extra $63 a month."

2009-02-15T16:34:43Z,"They say that tough times make fashion more creative. So far, men's designers seem to be doing everything except playing it straight - and we mean that quite literally. Patrik Ervell said he was inspired by ""mannish lesbians,"" especially as portrayed by the Dutch photographer Gon Buurman, when he was working on his denim shearling jackets, loosely structured blazers and slim pants pegged at the ankle. (There was also a pearl-accented Fair Isle sweater, cool enough to defy any kind of gender categorization.) Ervell sent down his runway just one woman, in a speckled suit, to make his masculine-girls-will-be-boys point - but one can't help but wonder whether that foray doesn't signal a tentative interest in women's wear."

Such outfits, bordering on drag (a golden leopard knit minidress over the point d'esprit), might satisfy the public fantasy of fashion, just as the few remaining peep shows and dirty magazine shops still convey what this part of town used to be like. I had the feeling several times over the weekend-at the Vena Cava presentation, at Christian Cota-that each audience represented a separate tribe, and had come to look at the clothes and grab a free drink just as they would attend an art opening. Sometimes the clothes and the crowd seem unrelated."

Backers say that the new technology would relieve congestion delays by allowing planes to fly closer together and to chart more direct flight paths. But the plan would require substantial investment not only by the government, but by the airlines as well."

Supporters say the project, which still needs legislative and environmental approval, will make drivers safer while easing access to the city's waterfront.

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"100 DAYS For Barack Obama, the first president of the Internet age, staying in touch means holding onto his BlackBerry. It's a healthy sign that he overcame security and bureaucratic reservations to keep this device, for he is quite right in saying that it is too easy for presidents to become isolated in ''the bubble'' of the presidency. Being comfortable in one's own skin does not guarantee a successful presidency. If it did, George W. Bush would be accorded higher marks than he receives from most historians and the American people. But optimism, a sense of normalcy, and a determination to keep in touch with the people you have inspired are useful attributes for any president. They helped F.D.R. become, in his words, first ''Dr. New Deal'' and then ''Dr. Win the War.'' They helped Ronald Reagan overcome the pessimism of malaise and the dismay of recession. And they have kept Americans rooting for Mr. Obama despite some early stumbles."
2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"THERE is no shortage of big dreams or grand schemes as the United States struggles to rebuild itself for the 21st century. But many of the most ambitious projects in the country -- a representative sample of which are listed below -- stand to get only modest amounts of money, if any, from the economic stimulus package that Congress approved on Friday. From a public works perspective, the $789 billion stimulus package is unlikely to transform the physical fabric of the nation as the New Deal did when it built hundreds of airports, tens of thousands of bridges, and hundreds of thousands of buildings and miles of roads."

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"Several ports on the Gulf of Mexico have begun ambitious expansion plans, which they say will put them in contention to handle more cargo from Asia after the Panama Canal finishes a widening project that will allow bigger ships through. The Port of New Orleans has a billion-dollar expansion to help anchor the economy of a region still battered by Hurricane Katrina. And the port in Gulfport, Miss., has its own billion-dollar plan to rebuild itself above sea level. It plans to pay for part of it with money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to the dismay of local housing advocates. Proponents say that both plans could save and add jobs in the hurricane-ravaged region, but there have been indications that less cargo is coming in because of the economic downturn, and they would still have to compete with the West Coast ports, which get most of the cargo from Asia, and, closer to home, Houston's bustling port."

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"It is one of the nation's busiest border crossings, but Detroit is linked to Canada only by a tunnel and an 80-year-old privately owned bridge. The United States and Canada are working together to build what they are calling the Detroit River International Crossing, a new six-lane bridge, and last month they got the final environmental clearance from the federal government. (They still need some local government approvals to acquire some land.) But the owner of the current bridge, the Ambassador Bridge, is moving ahead with a plan to build a new, privately owned bridge to replace the one he owns. With border crossings down these days, it is unclear if the Detroit River needs two new bridges, though state officials say it does. And officials say the severely depressed local economy could use the 10,000 jobs they say the public bridge project would generate on the Michigan side of the border."

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"Officials say that a major source of drinking water for about 25 million Californians is at risk. That water currently comes from the delta where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet, and the levees that protect the region are more than 100 years old and are vulnerable to earthquakes. A state task force recommended restoring the delta's endangered habitat and building a new aqueduct to bring water from Northern California to the arid south, without passing through the delta. A similar proposal was voted down in 1982 because northerners viewed it as a water grab by the south, and farmers in the delta region feared losing their water. But the current drought, and climate change, have provided a new sense of urgency. The bill included $50 million that can be used in the delta region, but that is only a tiny fraction of what the state estimates it will eventually need."

From 1984 to 1994, Mr. Green was a public and financial affairs consultant to the Belzberg family of Vancouver, Canada. During this time he worked directly with family members as an advisor on their public and private interests. One major concern was helping to develop the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, a world-renowned museum that took 10 years to complete. The lead family member, Samuel Belzberg, is the museum's Chairman of the Board. As principal advisor, Sidney Green was chief fundraiser and design originator, helping to raise over US $50 million for this innovative interactive, multimedia multicultural educational program. He also scouted investment opportunities for the Belzberg family companies through First City Merchant Bank, Inc. of New York. Mr. Green is survived by his wife of 25 years, Candida McCollam, a daughter Amy LeBlanc, and three grandchildren, Nicholas, Nathaniel and Joanetta. A memorial service will be held at 2 pm, March 1 at the New York Tolerance Center.

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"The American midfielder Michael Bradley capped a week in which he scored both goals for the United States in a win over Mexico in a World Cup qualifying game by scoring the tying goal Saturday as last-place Borussia Mönchengladbach earned a 1-1 tie at Werder Bremen in the German Bundesliga. Three minutes after Claudio Pizarro had given Bremen the lead, Bradley used his chest to direct a free kick by Marko Marin into the goal. It is Bradley's first season with Mönchengladbach, which seems headed for relegation. In Berlin, Hertha striker Andrey Voronin scored both goals as his team took over first place with a 2-1 win over Bayern Munich. Voronin scored his first in the 38th minute before Bayern's Miroslav Klose tied the score in the 61st minute. Ten minutes later, midfielder Franck Ribéry went on a darting run, and put striker Landon Donovan, who entered the match in the first half for the injured Luca Toni, into a perfect position to score. But Donovan misfired on the shot. JAMES SETS RECORD Goalkeeper David James set a record by playing his 536th Premier League game as Portsmouth defeated Manchester City, 2-0. Glen Johnson and Hermann Hreidarsson scored in the second half as Portsmouth won in its first game since Manager Tony Adams was fired five days ago. The home victory at Fratton Park lifted Portsmouth to 15th place with 27 points, 4 points above the three-team relegation zone in English soccer's top division. James, 38, broke the Premier League appearance mark held by Gary Speed. His career includes spells at Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham and Manchester City. (AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE)"

He was the founder and president of Rolf Werner Rosenthal, Inc., a highly successful medical advertising agency, and World Health, a continuing education service for health care professionals. The agency had more than 130 employees, and Rolf proudly and passionately promoted both diversity and creativity in the workplace. In 1997 he was among the first to be elected to the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame. Rolf loved and sought beauty in all its forms<--music, ballet, literature, opera and nature. He was a philanthropist, a talented writer and an avid art collector, but his joy in working in his garden surpassed all else. We're convinced that his final wishes are something along the lines of: actively support the Obama administration; do the things you love while you can; and, get out and plant something in the earth. Rolf's gracious and generous spirit will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. Think of him in the spring when the dogwoods bloom.

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"SEABROOK--John Martin, a New Jersey farm boy who became a corporate titan, influential sportsman, and international icon of Saville Row style, died at his home in Aiken, SC, on February 11. He was 91. Mr. Seabrook was born on April 16, 1917, in Bridgeton, NJ, the youngest of four children. His father, Charles F. Seabrook, and grandfather built a small Cumberland County farm into Seabrook Farms, one of the largest industrialized farms in the world, with interests in growing, canning and eventually freezing vegetables. Upon graduating from Princeton University in l939, he went to work at Seabrook Farms, becoming president in l954. Under his leadership, Seabrook Farms developed the boil in the pouch method of cooking its popular frozen creamed spinach, as well as pioneering frozen entrees that would become known as ""TV dinners"". By 1959, some 25,000 acres of South Jersey farmland were either owned or leased by the company. That same year, Mr. Seabrook had a falling out with his father, who sold the company, and Seabrook resigned. Mr. Seabrook soon regained his footing, however, becoming by the mid-1960's the chief executive of I.U. International, a utilities company headquartered in Philadelphia. Mr. Seabrook built I.U. into a global corporation with interests in energy, mining, shipping, transportation, and food products. In 1956 Mr. Seabrook married Elizabeth Ann Toomey, a newspaper reporter whom he had met earlier that year, while aboard the U.S. Constitution, en route to Grace Kelly's wedding to Prince Rainer of Monaco. Seabrook was a guest of the Kelly family; his future bride was covering the wedding for United Press International. By the early 1960's, when Esquire Magazine first named him to its Best Dressed Men in American list, Mr. Seabrook was recognized as one of the country's most stylish devotees of the British Saville Row look. To accommodate his wardrobe, he installed a revolving dry cleaner's carousel in the attic of the 18th century farmhouse in Salem, NJ where he and his family lived. Mr. Seabrook was also instrumental in reviving the sport of horse drawn ""coaching"" in the U.S. He often conducted business from the box seat of a road coach. Richard Fain, who as a young executive worked under Seabrook at I.U, and later became the CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, recalled, ""He would be holding four reins in one hand, a coaching whip and champagne glass in the other, driving four horses through farm roads lined with vegetables, remarking on the state of the crops, while simultaneously discussing how best to finance the five new supertankers the company was getting ready to order"". After retiring from I.U. in 1981, Mr. Seabrook and his wife began to spend more time in Aiken, SC, where he pursued his interest in coaching and lent his time to preserving the Hitchcock Woods, a 2,000-acre urban park in the middle of Aiken. They moved there permanently in 2000; Mrs. Seabrook died in 2005. The last great enterprise of his life was devoted to ensuring that the nearly 2000 acres he still owned in New Jersey would be preserved as farmland in perpetuity. In November, 2008, the state announced the purchase of the development rights-the largest preservation deal in New Jersey history. Mr. Seabrook is survived by his four children Carol Boulanger, Lizanne Brooke, and John Seabrook, Jr., all of Manhattan, and Bruce Seabrook, of Miami, FL and by five grandchildren. Funeral Services will be held on Tuesday, February 17, at the Deerfield Presbyterian Church, in Deerfield, NJ. Memorial contributions can be made to the Brandywine Conservancy, P.O. Box 141, Chadds Ford, PA 19317, or to the Hitchcock Woods Foundation, P.O. Box 1702, Aiken, SC 29802."

2009-02-15T00:00:00Z,"High-speed trains are increasingly common in Asia and Europe, but they have yet to make it to the United States. Now Californians are trying to change that. In November, California's voters approved a measure authorizing $10 billion in borrowing to begin work on an 800-mile high-speed train capable of going more than twice as fast as the average speed of the Acela trains on the East Coast, and which could make the trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles in 2 hours and 40 minutes. Supporters say that the plan would reduce congestion on highways and at airports and invigorate the economy; skeptics question whether the plan makes economic sense. The final bill includes $8 billion for high-speed rail; but there are 11 regions that could compete for the money, which would at most be a small down payment on what promises to be a costly project."

In an interview Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Mr. Rosenblat said, “It wasn’t a lie. It was my imagination. And in my imagination, in my mind, I believed it. Even now I believe it, that she was there and she threw the apple to me.” Mr. Rosenblat made similar statements in a video circulated on YouTube.

2009-02-18T11:07:49Z,"Should Heath Ledger be named best supporting actor at the Oscars on Sunday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said that the statuette would eventually become the possession of Matilda Rose Ledger, the daughter of the late actor and Michelle Williams, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Ledger, who died in January 2008 of an accidental drug overdose, is nominated for his performance in “The Dark Knight.” By academy tradition, posthumous Oscars are generally given to a winner’s spouse or oldest child. Mr. Ledger was not married to Ms. Williams, but Matilda, who is 3, is legally ineligible to sign the contract the academy mandates for all Oscar recipients, which limits their ability to resell the statuette. Hence, if Mr. Ledger wins, the award will be given to Ms. Williams, in trust for Matilda until she turns 18. The academy has not said who would accept the Oscar for Mr. Ledger at the ceremony. A Golden Globe for Mr. Ledger in January was accepted by Christopher Nolan, director of “The Dark Knight.”"

Ronald K. Martin, the school’s drama instructor, said the production was canceled by the principal, Fal Asrani, who objected to its gay characters. Ms. Asrani told The Register that Mr. Martin stopped the show because there was not enough time to revise the script. Mr. Martin said that was not true, adding that scripts for the play had not yet been ordered. In December Rowlett High School in Rowlett, Tex., canceled its planned production of “Rent” after parents and community members objected to the content of the show, though its cast members performed a version of the show at nearby Southern Methodist University."

The movie “Pride and Predator,” directed by Will Clark and written by Mr. Clark with Andrew Kemble and John Pape, will juxtapose brooding aristocrats with a brutal alien that lands in 1800s-era Britain, attacking residents and leaving them with neither sense nor sensibility. The film, to be produced by Elton John’s Rocket Pictures, is the latest work to mix the hoary costume genre with elements of horror. A book called “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” credited to Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith and published by Quirk Books, will combine the Austen novel with “all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie action.” And a coming novel by Michael Thomas Ford called “Jane Bites Back” depicts Austen as a frustrated vampire, taking revenge on those who have made money from her work."

Quiet and sheltering like the old growth trees he loved, Walton was a gifted talker who preferred to listen, a lover of people, not things, who coveted only firelight, a view of the woods and water in the company of family and friends. A man of principle rather than creed, Walton lived an exemplary life dedicated to an ever widening circle of family and to the pursuit of his core values: integrity, modesty, simplicity, and fairness. Ambitious and accomplished in his youth, in middle age Walton retired from a career as an aviation safety analyst and engineer to pursue a wide variety of cultural interests with his new bride Joan at his side. Walton loved his wife's children, Amy, Douglas, and Ellen, like his own, Derek and Wendy. He was a father to his niece Lorna and a devoted grandfather to Emily, Jordan, Jackson, Graham, Ava, Julia, Kate, and Sun. While all of us mourn the loss of this beautiful spirit, Walton's death divides asunder a loving couple. Now, I understand the meaning of the verses he taught me as a child: ""To me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.""

The production company Morgan Creek has filed suit against Amaru Entertainment, the company run by Mr. Shakur’s mother, Afeni, saying it reneged on an agreement to sell the hip-hop performer’s life rights for a movie. Morgan Creek’s complaint said a written contract was in place, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but a lawyer for Amaru Entertainment said, “There is no agreement with Morgan Creek, there never was, and there never will be.” Relations between the two companies were said to have broken down last month around the time of release of “Notorious,” the biographical movie about a rival rapper, Notorious B.I.G."

In an interview, Mr. Begley said he had twice profiled Mr. Updike, for Mirabella magazine in the 1990s and for The Observer in 2003. “He was the world’s smoothest interview,” Mr. Begley said. “Almost every word out of his mouth was quotable.” Additionally, Mr. Begley said, his father, the novelist Louis Begley, and Mr. Updike had been classmates at Harvard University, where they both received degrees in English literature. Adam Begley said that although he had written a letter of condolence to Mr. Updike’s widow, Martha, it was “too soon” to ask her about access to the author’s papers at Harvard’s Houghton Library. The biography is expected to be published in 2011."

2009-02-19T12:56:50Z,"Fashion editors are not as nasty as the media would have you believe. But you would be cranky too if your feet were always killing you. Yesterday, I pushed the limits of my own good humor by wearing what had always seemed to be a very manageable pair of platform boots. (Note to self: never start the day by hoofing from 8th Avenue and 37th Street to 5th Avenue and 41st Street in 5-inch heels.) By evening I was practically crawling on my hands and knees to the six presentations I still had to attend -- all of which were, natch, within walking distance. Then I remembered that I had left a pair Kushyfoot insole socks at the office and so I ran -- okay, hobbled -- back to grab them. Slipping into these funny little padded socklets was one of the best experiences of my week -- if not my year or my life. The socks come in black nylon and even lace, and are discreet enough not stick out of your shoe, though if they did you could always just smile and tell people they're Prada."
