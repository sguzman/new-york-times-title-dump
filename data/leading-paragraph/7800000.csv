Gabriel. of Greenwich, CT and formerly of Palm Beach, FL, one of the country's leading intellectual property authorities, died peacefully at home from complications from prostate cancer on August 8 at the age of 91. He was a son of the late Philip and Simmi Perle. A native of New York City, Gabe, as he was known, was an Eagle Scout and graduated from Queens College in 1943 where he was president of the Student Council, editor of the school's newspaper, and the first recipient of the Student Council Award for Distinguished Service to Queens College. He served as a Lieutenant in the amphibious forces in the Navy during World War II and was in command of landing craft during the initial assault waves in the invasions of Guam, Leyte, Luzon and Okinawa. After the war, Mr. Perle entered Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and obtained his law degree in 1949. Mr. Perle began his legal career at the New York City firm of Cravath, Swain & Moore and spent many years as Corporate Vice President-Law at Time Inc. where he was responsible for the legal affairs of Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Money and People magazines as well as Time-Life Books, Home Box Office and Time Warner Cable. During his years at Time Inc., Mr. Perle became one of the country's leading authorities in intellectual property, copyright, publishing, computer, entertainment and communications law. In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed Mr. Perle as a founding Commissioner of the National Commission on New Technological Works (""CONTU""), which drafted legislation enacted by Congress for the protection of computer programming and software. His pioneering work helped lay the foundation for all future discussions of copyright law.

Mr. Perle was a past President and Honorary Trustee of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and a two-time Chairman of the American Bar Association's Copyright Division/IP Law Section in addition to having been a Vice President and Member of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Trademark Association.

He was a member of the Century Association of New York City, and had been a member of Banyan Golf Club of Palm Beach, Sunningdale Country Club of Scarsdale and the Yale Club of New York City for many years.

Gabriel. of Greenwich, CT and formerly of Palm Beach, FL, one of the country's leading intellectual property authorities, died peacefully at home from complications from prostate cancer on August 8 at the age of 91. He was a son of the late Philip and Simmi Perle. A native of New York City, Gabe, as he was known, was an Eagle Scout and graduated from Queens College in 1943 where he was president of the Student Council, editor of the school's newspaper, and the first recipient of the Student Council Award for Distinguished Service to Queens College. He served as a Lieutenant in the amphibious forces in the Navy during World War II and was in command of landing craft during the initial assault waves in the invasions of Guam, Leyte, Luzon and Okinawa. After the war, Mr. Perle entered Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and obtained his law degree in 1949. Mr. Perle began his legal career at the New York City firm of Cravath, Swain & Moore and spent many years as Corporate Vice President-Law at Time Inc. where he was responsible for the legal affairs of Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, Money and People magazines as well as Time-Life Books, Home Box Office and Time Warner Cable. During his years at Time Inc., Mr. Perle became one of the country's leading authorities in intellectual property, copyright, publishing, computer, entertainment and communications law. In 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed Mr. Perle as a founding Commissioner of the National Commission on New Technological Works (""CONTU""), which drafted legislation enacted by Congress for the protection of computer programming and software. His pioneering work helped lay the foundation for all future discussions of copyright law. At the time of his death, Mr. Perle was Senior Counsel at the intellectual property law firm Ohlandt Greeley Ruggiero & Perle, in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Perle was a past President and Honorary Trustee of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and a two-time Chairman of the American Bar Association's Copyright Division/IP Law Section in addition to having been a Vice President and Member of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Trademark Association. Mr. Perle co-authored, along with attorney John Williams, the seminal two-volume work, Perle & Williams on Publishing Law.

He was also a former director and secretary of the Baron de Hirsch Fund, of which he was an honorary Trustee. He was a member of the Century Association of New York City, and had been a member of Banyan Golf Club of Palm Beach, Sunningdale Country Club of Scarsdale and the Yale Club of New York City for many years. Brilliant, witty, and dynamic, Mr. Perle thoroughly enjoyed life, golf and a good martini. But most of all, he loved - and was dearly loved - by his family: his wife, Patricia Sinnott Perle; his daughter Elizabeth Anne Perle, son-in-law Steven Pressman and grandson David Perle McKenna of San Francisco; and his stepchildren Jo-Anne Sinnott of Larchmont, NY, Diane Sinnott of Tiburon, Cal. and William Sinnott of Norwalk, Conn. Mr. Perle was predeceased by his first wife, Ellen Carlotta Kraus of Philadelphia, and his brother Richard of New York City. At Mr. Perle's request, there will be no funeral service.

2014-08-11T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Arthur G. It is with overwhelming sadness that the family of Arthur G. Cohen announces his sudden and untimely passing on August 9th at the age of 84 in Kings Point, New York, his home for decades with the love of his life, Karen Bassine Cohen. Arthur and Karen recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, a joyous occasion shared with their devoted daughters, Lauren, Susan, Debra, Rochelle and Kathy, nine wonderful grandchildren Allison, Hanni, Caroline, Jennifer, Charlie, Kate, William, Emily and Henry - who made him proud and brought him much joy, sons-in-law Jeffrey, Mark and Jeigh, grandson-in-law Matthew and other members of his extended family, who survive him and, with Karen, will miss the wisdom, boundless energy, generosity and love of their family patriarch. Arthur is also survived by his sister, Marilyn Davimos; his brother, Richard M. Cohen, predeceased him. For more than 50 years Arthur enjoyed an illustrious career as a builder, developer, investor, owner and manager of real estate throughout the United States and abroad, having earned a legendary reputation as a pioneer in revitalizing Times Square through his ownership interest in the iconic, landmarked Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway and his development of the 1500 Broadway office tower and the Crowne Plaza, Paramount and Michelangelo hotels. His foresight in recognizing the potential of the far west side of midtown Manhattan produced the Westyard office-warehouse facility at 450 West 33rd Street, around which an entire new community is now burgeoning, the Worldwide Plaza mixed-use complex at Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets on the site of the former Madison Square Garden and 888 Seventh Avenue, across from Carnegie Hall. Arthur's innovative ideas produced many other distinctive, high-profile projects such as the Peninsula Hotel and Olympic Tower in New York City and Aventura in North Miami, Florida. Though Arthur preferred to maintain a low profile, he often partnered with many of the most active and renowned developers, property managers and financial investors of the last 50 years and today, who consider him a trailblazer in creating new ways of structuring and financing real estate transactions. Born in Brooklyn, New York to Frances and L.D. Cohen, Arthur graduated from the University of Miami and New York Law School. Though he became an attorney admitted to the New York Bar and remained so for more than 50 years, he entered the real estate field in a small way shortly after completing law school, but moved rapidly to developing department store properties and retail centers and, in 1971 at the age of 40, to creating Arlen Realty & Development, then the nation's largest publicly-held real estate enterprise, with a vast portfolio of office buildings, hotels, single- and multi-family residential buildings and more than 250 shopping centers worldwide, as well as the E. J. Korvette department store chain. Always available to share his expertise and numerous real estate industry and financial market connections with both his contemporaries and the next generation of real estate and other business entrepreneurs, Arthur never ceased to enjoy the constant flow of potential worldwide projects brought to him by admirers of his ""laser beam"" analytical skills and remarkable physical stamina, which he also exhibited in his ""scratch"" golf game frequently on display at Old Westbury's Glen Oaks Country Club and the Palm Beach Country Club. But no diversion from his intense work ethic gave Arthur greater pleasure than sailing with his family on Long Island Sound in his cherished vintage sailboat ""Les Girls"", named to honor his wife and five daughters. In addition to Arthur's business and recreational pursuits, he was involved in numerous educational, professional and philanthropic activities, including guest lectureships at the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School of Business, directorships of Citicorp and the Home Title Division of Chicago Title Insurance Company and a trusteeship of the John Hancock Mutual Fund. His public service internationally included membership on the Special Mission to Israel under Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and as Special Envoy to aid underprivileged nations under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Often recognized by his real estate industry peers and the broader business community, among his honors are having been named Man of the Year by the Anti-Defamation League and the City of Hope and having received the Tree of Life Award from the Jewish National Fund and an honorary degree from Long Island University. His memberships on Boards of Trustees have included Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, Brandeis University (Emeritus), New York Law School and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The family requests that their wishes for a private funeral service and interment be respected. Donations may be made in memory of Arthur to the Anti-Defamation League, which he previously served as President."

A highly respected figure in the art world, he was known for his connoisseurship, prescience and kindness. His support of artists both emerging and established was legendary. Richard was a wise, dignified, modest and gentle man, unfettered by convention, who refrained from judgment. Worldly, innately elegant, well read and travelled, Richard's insatiable curiosity was manifested in diverse collections of contemporary art, Mexican silver, vintage pottery and post cards. He was a loving spouse, generous friend and bon vivant. For twenty years from 1974-1993 he was Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he organized numerous Biennial Exhibitions of contemporary art, and many seminal one-artist and group exhibitions including New Image Painting, Ceramic Sculpture, The New Sculpture 1965-75: Between Geometry and Gesture, American Art Since 1970, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jonathan Borofsky, Alexander Calder, Alex Katz, Robert Kushner, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mapplethorpe, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Edward Ruscha, and Joel Shapiro, among others.

Since 2003, Richard served as Curator of The Lever House Art Collection -- a collection of works commissioned for display at the Lever House's outdoor plaza and glass-enclosed lobby, located at Park Avenue and 53rd Street, New York. The first commission was a neon installation by Keith Sonnier. Subsequent commissions included ambitious works by Jorge Pardo, John Chamberlain, Damien Hirst, Peter Wegner, Barnaby Furnas, Jeff Koons, E.V. Day, Sarah Morris, Folkert de Jong, Enoc Perez, Tom Friedman, Richard Dupont, Tom Sachs, Liza Lou, and Paula Hayes.

Upon graduation he threw himself into the George McGovern campaign for President, then joined the New York City Corporation Counsel where he was involved in environmental litigation and important policy matters, becoming Chief of the General Litigation Division. Mayor Ed Koch valued his wisdom and appointed him to fill an open seat on the bench as Judge of the Civil Court. Thereafter, he worked at Proskauer Rose LLC for several years before establishing a private practice dealing with New York City agencies. His last position, before the onset of his illness, was Chief of Staff and Special Counsel to the Commissioner of the New York Department of Buildings. Steve was known for mentoring young colleagues, many of whom went on to prominent careers with the City and in public service. Although born in Washington, D.C., Steve became the quintessential New Yorker, often riding his bicycle with Bonnie to all five boroughs, visiting frequently the Bronx and Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Central Park, the City's many museums, attending theater, movies and musical events, a passion which engaged his entire family. Steve and Bonnie were pioneers in moving to Tribeca in 1983, and loved their loft and the community in their neighborhood. In addition to Bonnie and his children, Steve is survived by his sisters Ruth Kramer Ziony and Edie Kramer Wilairat. Steve was a constant source of intellectual energy and warmth to his many friends and his absence will be felt by all. Shiva will be at the Kramer/Franklin residence at 16 Hudson Street starting Monday from 5-8pm until Thursday. In lieu of flowers, donations in Steve's honor may be sent to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (www.theMMRF.org)."

2014-08-12T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Arthur G. It is with overwhelming sadness that the family of Arthur G. Cohen announces his sudden and untimely passing on August 9th at the age of 84 in Kings Point, New York, his home for decades with the love of his life, Karen Bassine Cohen. Arthur and Karen recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, a joyous occasion shared with their devoted daughters, Lauren, Susan, Debra, Rochelle and Kathy, nine wonderful grandchildren Allison, Hanni, Caroline, Jennifer, Charlie, Kate, William, Emily and Henry - who made him proud and brought him much joy, sons-in-law Jeffrey, Mark and Jeigh, grandson-in-law Matthew and other members of his extended family, who survive him and, with Karen, will miss the wisdom, boundless energy, generosity and love of their family patriarch. Arthur is also survived by his sister, Marilyn Davimos; his brother, Richard M. Cohen, predeceased him. For more than 50 years Arthur enjoyed an illustrious career as a builder, developer, investor, owner and manager of real estate throughout the United States and abroad, having earned a legendary reputation as a pioneer in revitalizing Times Square through his ownership interest in the iconic, landmarked Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway and his development of the 1500 Broadway office tower and the Crowne Plaza, Paramount and Michelangelo hotels. His foresight in recognizing the potential of the far west side of midtown Manhattan produced the Westyard office-warehouse facility at 450 West 33rd Street, around which an entire new community is now burgeoning, the Worldwide Plaza mixed-use complex at Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets on the site of the former Madison Square Garden and 888 Seventh Avenue, across from Carnegie Hall. Arthur's innovative ideas produced many other distinctive, high-profile projects such as the Peninsula Hotel and Olympic Tower in New York City and Aventura in North Miami, Florida. Though Arthur preferred to maintain a low profile, he often partnered with many of the most active and renowned developers, property managers and financial investors of the last 50 years and today, who consider him a trailblazer in creating new ways of structuring and financing real estate transactions. Born in Brooklyn, New York to Frances and L.D. Cohen, Arthur graduated from the University of Miami and New York Law School. Though he became an attorney admitted to the New York Bar and remained so for more than 50 years, he entered the real estate field in a small way shortly after completing law school, but moved rapidly to developing department store properties and retail centers and, in 1971 at the age of 40, to creating Arlen Realty & Development, then the nation's largest publicly-held real estate enterprise, with a vast portfolio of office buildings, hotels, single- and multi-family residential buildings and more than 250 shopping centers worldwide, as well as the E. J. Korvette department store chain. Always available to share his expertise and numerous real estate industry and financial market connections with both his contemporaries and the next generation of real estate and other business entrepreneurs, Arthur never ceased to enjoy the constant flow of potential worldwide projects brought to him by admirers of his ""laser beam"" analytical skills and remarkable physical stamina, which he also exhibited in his ""scratch"" golf game frequently on display at Old Westbury's Glen Oaks Country Club and the Palm Beach Country Club. But no diversion from his intense work ethic gave Arthur greater pleasure than sailing with his family on Long Island Sound in his cherished vintage sailboat ""Les Girls"", named to honor his wife and five daughters. In addition to Arthur's business and recreational pursuits, he was involved in numerous educational, professional and philanthropic activities, including guest lectureships at the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School of Business, directorships of Citicorp and the Home Title Division of Chicago Title Insurance Company and a trusteeship of the John Hancock Mutual Fund. His public service internationally included membership on the Special Mission to Israel under Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and as Special Envoy to aid underprivileged nations under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Often recognized by his real estate industry peers and the broader business community, among his honors are having been named Man of the Year by the Anti-Defamation League and the City of Hope and having received the Tree of Life Award from the Jewish National Fund and an honorary degree from Long Island University. His memberships on Boards of Trustees have included Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, Brandeis University (Emeritus), New York Law School and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The family requests that their wishes for a private funeral service and interment be respected. Donations may be made in memory of Arthur to the Anti-Defamation League, which he previously served as President."

2014-08-13T00:00:00Z,"MARSHALL--Richard Donald. An independent curator, art historian and art consultant based in New York City and La Jolla, California died unexpectedly on August 8th at his home in La Jolla. Born in Los Angeles in 1947, and educated at the University of California, Irvine, he moved to New York City to enroll in the Museum Studies Program of the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. A highly respected figure in the art world, he was known for his connoisseurship, prescience and kindness. His support of artists both emerging and established was legendary. Richard was a wise, dignified, modest and gentle man, unfettered by convention, who refrained from judgment. Worldly, innately elegant, well read and travelled, Richard's insatiable curiosity was manifested in diverse collections of contemporary art, Mexican silver, vintage pottery and post cards. He was a loving spouse, generous friend and bon vivant. For twenty years from 1974-1993 he was Curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he organized numerous Biennial Exhibitions of contemporary art, and many seminal one-artist and group exhibitions including New Image Painting, Ceramic Sculpture, The New Sculpture 1965-75: Between Geometry and Gesture, American Art Since 1970, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jonathan Borofsky, Alexander Calder, Alex Katz, Robert Kushner, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mapplethorpe, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Edward Ruscha, and Joel Shapiro, among others. Richard organized international exhibitions of Louise Bourgeois (Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Monterrey, Mexico; and Contemporary Art Museum, Seville, Spain); Edward Ruscha (Museo Nacional de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid); Alexander Calder (Japan Art and Culture Association, Tokyo); Robert Mapplethorpe (Mitsukoshi Museum, Tokyo); Jean-Michel Basquiat (Serpentine Gallery, London); Joan Mitchell (Instituto Valenciano de Arte Moderno, Valencia, Spain); Georgia O'Keeffe (Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; and Vancouver Art Gallery, British Columbia); and Jack Pierson (Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin). Richard's books include, Ed Ruscha (Phaidon Press); Jack Pierson; Desire Despair (Rizzoli International); Georgia O'Keeffe; Nature and Abstraction (Skira Publishers); and Kenny Scharf (Rizzolli International), among others. He served as art editor of the Paris Review from 1975-1990. Since 2003, Richard served as Curator of The Lever House Art Collection -- a collection of works commissioned for display at the Lever House's outdoor plaza and glass-enclosed lobby, located at Park Avenue and 53rd Street, New York. The first commission was a neon installation by Keith Sonnier. Subsequent commissions included ambitious works by Jorge Pardo, John Chamberlain, Damien Hirst, Peter Wegner, Barnaby Furnas, Jeff Koons, E.V. Day, Sarah Morris, Folkert de Jong, Enoc Perez, Tom Friedman, Richard Dupont, Tom Sachs, Liza Lou, and Paula Hayes. In addition, Richard was a former member of the Authentication Committee of the Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Byzantine Fresco Foundation, The Menil Collection, Houston; and a member of the Advisory Board of the Alexander Calder Foundation, New York, and a Trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. He is survived by his partner and spouse of twenty-five years William T.

2014-08-13T00:00:00Z,"HANKS--John L.,74, of New York, NY and Rumson, NJ, passed away on August 9, 2014, at his home in Rumson, NJ, after a brief, valiant battle against lung cancer. He leaves behind his beloved wife Fran Condon, his brother Dan, his sister Florence and a host of dear friends and colleagues. Born in Staten Island, NY, and raised on the West Coast, John had an illustrious professional career spanning significant public service for the City of New York; as an educator through his tenure as Professor of Law and Associate Dean at the Yeshiva University Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he was a Founding faculty member; as his volunteer service as a Board member of the Art Students League of New York, and as a successful business leader and owner of a long-term care facility, King James Care Center of Chatham, NJ. John holds a B.S. degree from Rutgers University's College of Engineering; a J.D. Degree from Rutgers University School of Law, where he was Research Editor of the Rutgers Law Review; a Master of Arts degree in Economics from Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a Master of Laws degree from Columbia University School of Law. Among the many accomplishments during his public service career, John served as Director of Franchises for the City of New York. In that capacity, he provided testimony to the US Senate regarding the affects of vertical and horizontal integration and consolidation that was then taking place in the cable industry. Of particular note is John's service as Special Master from 1980-1988, appointed by Federal District Court Judge Robert L. Carter to oversee the financing, design and construction of two sewage treatment plants in New York City. This complex project was managed on time and under budget. A community park atop one of the sewage treatment plants alongside the Hudson River, serving the Harlem community, is a lasting testament to John's success in this role. John is the author of numerous publications in Franchising Law and the Regulation of Cable Television. He is also the author of the publication ""On a Just Measure of the Efficiency of Law and Governmental Policies"". After his service to the City of New York and Cardozo Law School, John focused on ensuring the highest quality of care at the King James Care Center of Chatham and his life-long passion as an artist. John's generosity with his friends and family expressed itself most importantly in his capacity to listen, analyze and advise. Most sadly he leaves behind his wife, best friend and business partner, Fran Condon. The love and life they shared together was an inspiration to all of their friends. A wake will be held at Thompson Memorial Home, Red Bank, NJ on August 13 from 2-4 and 7-9pm. Service to be held at Church of the Nativity, Fair Haven, NJ on August 14 at 11am.

2014-08-15T00:00:00Z,"SPANAKOS--William M.,April 11, 1928--August 11, 2014. With great sadness, the family of William (Bill) Michael Spanakos, of Bayside Queens, announces his passing. William was a practicing attorney for over fifty years and had an office in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The eldest of seven sons born to Michael Basil Spanakos, and Stella (Katsorhis) Spanakos, passed away in Queens, NY, on Sunday night. He was surrounded by his family. William attended the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD, in the late 40's; Graduated St. John's Law School, 1953; Served honorably for two years in the US Army, and was admitted to practice law in New York in 1955. William practiced law throughout the City, specializing in Criminal law and Commercial Transactions in the Restaurant Industry. He maintained a practice in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn for fifty eight years, along with his beloved brother and partner, John Spanakos, who sadly predeceased Bill by just over one year. William maintained the practice after the loss of his brother, and continued to work until his own passing. His sense of honesty and integrity served him, his firm, his family, and his clients honorably. He was a sought after advocate and had a fondness for representing the underdog. During his long and illustrious career he had the opportunity to be involved with many infamous legal cases. He represented individuals involved in the sensational Sentry Armored Car heist case in Astoria, and individuals involved in the notorious Claus von Bulow case. William took great pride in his successful appeal before the United States Supreme Court in the Athens case. He was known for his charitable works, and in 1990 established a scholarship fund in honor of his parents which served to assist financially challenged individuals of Greek descent to pursue and obtain their degrees in Medicine. William's father Michael was a prominent business man and restaurateur. He and his wife Stella, operated the ""Paramount"" located at 584 Court Street from the 1920's- 1950's. Stella, because of her charitable work in the community, went on to become New York State's Mother of the Year, after her husband had passed. Michael and Stella were proud Greek immigrants who settled and raised their family in Red Hook, Brooklyn. They instilled in their sons strong values of integrity, family, faith and a hard work ethic. William honored those values all the days of his life; and he sought to instill those values in his children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. He was very proud of the fact that he had nine practicing attornevs in the family, and of all of those of the next generation who went on to become professionals. He was also very proud of each of his brothers, including those who achieved national and international athletic acclaim in the sport of Boxing for competition in the National Golden Gloves, Pan American Games and the Olympics. William was also predeceased by his brother Ernest and his wife Helen, his brother Charles and his wife Effie, his sister-in-law Mary, wife of John, and his son in law and friend Paul Kitsos. William is survived by his soulmate, Sheila Silverstein, his beloved children Michael Spanakos, Stella Spanakos, Lillian Spanakos, Helen Spanakos-Weitman, (Allen), Athena Spanakos-O'Riordan, (Eion); his beloved brothers George Spanakos, Peter Spanakos and Nick Spanakos, and each of their wives, his devoted long time secretary and friend, Helena Luchau, his grandchildren John, Michael, Paul, Nicholas, Jenna, Matthew, Andrew, and many nieces and nephews. William was a patriarch, father, brother, grandfather, uncle and friend. He was highly intelligent, witty and fearless, a tough gentleman. He was a true Renaissance man. He was hard but not hardened. He took great pride in himself and his appearance, and was an absolutely impeccable dresser. He was quick to laugh and to make others laugh. He was a very interesting character, with enormous depth and dimension. He was the kind of person anyone would want in their corner. He will be remembered for these many things. YIA SOU BILL!

A brilliant musician, lyricist and advertising genius, Bob served in Korea then began his career at McCann Erikson in the 1950's. He moved to Benton & Bowels where he was a creative director on Post Cereals. In 1964 he and Arch Nadler founded Nadler&Larimer which grew into a thriving advertising agency handling accounts such as Austin Nichols and Faberge. Bob created the highly- acclaimed Brut TV commercials -- interviews with athletes Joe Namath, Willie Mays and Jimmy Connors. The agency was sold to Mickleberry in 1980. He later joined his wife, Riki Kane, in her housewares company, Metrokane inc. Together they built a multi-million dollar business focusing on wine accessories, specifically the Rabbit and Houdini brands. The key to the company's success was Bob's advertising expertise. The Rabbit brand became famous world-wide and was advertised consistently in The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker. Beyond his stunning career in advertising and marketing, Bob's first love was musical theater. Over the years he created several off-broadway and one broadway show, ""But Never Jam Today"" directed by Vinette Caroll. He wrote the music and lyrics for the last song recorded by Marlene Dietrich, ""The World Goes Rolling On."" This past June, he completed a concept album ""Maxie's"" an original jazz musical featuring vocalists Billy Porter, Jason Alexander, Heather Headley, Shirley Jones, Ruben Studdard, John Schneider and Jennifer Holliday. Much of Bob's music can be heard on his website..www.songsby boblarimer.com. A true renaissance man, Bob was a voracious reader, devouring books on politics and history. In Watermill, his favorite pastime was reading on his deck overlooking the lake and enjoying beautiful sunsets. In New York, his favorite pastime was composing music and playing his grand piano for hours on end. On Tuesday nights, he loved playing poker with his cronies. When he was younger he loved tennis. When they were hitting, he loved the Yankees. But most of all, he loved his wife and partner in life, Riki Kane Larimer. Their relationship spanned over five decades; they simply adored each other. In addition to his wife Riki, he leaves his son Neil (Kathy) daughter Cheryl (Jaime) granddaughters Heather, Vanessa and Gabriela; grandsons Alan and Robby, great-grandson Carter, brother-in-law Michael Kane of Los Angeles and his adorable puppy Miki who will miss snuggling up with him under the covers every night. Bob lived his life to the fullest and died with his boots on. Services to be held Monday August 18 at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home 1076 Madison Ave at 11:30am. The family will be receiving friends at home in New York Monday after 6pm."

In 1968, she co-founded, with Marjorie Talalay, The New Gallery, later renamed the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland. Having moved to Washington D.C. in 1973, she then joined forces with Susan Sollins from 1975-1978 to establish Independent Curators Incorporated (ICI), which organized ambitious and artistically challenging exhibitions and is now known as Independent Curators International. From 1984 to 1990, Sundell served as director of the art gallery of Lehman College, CUNY, in the Bronx. She spent her final decades supporting her husband's work as president of the artist and writer's colony, Yaddo, traveling with family and close friends, and authoring a novel entitled The Dallek Touch. Witty, wise, and wide-ranging in her knowledge and love of the arts, she will be sorely missed not only by family but also by her many friends and associates. The family is grateful to Dr. Leslie Boyd, MD and her staff at NYU Langone Medical Center and Dorien Spelbrink and her staff at Heaven Can Wait, LLC for their care and support during her last years. A memorial, to be announced, is planned for the fall. In lieu of flowers, please send memorial contributions to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York."

We will miss her sorely, but will remember with joy the excitement of experiencing new works of art together and the many extraordinary conversations filled with laughter. Wickedly witty and endlessly curious, Nina was voracious in her literary readings, and in her ability to absorb vast amounts of information about the arts in general, and contemporary art in particular. To look at art of any era with her always brought forth new and unexpected insights. We were privileged to join Nina in supporting and starting projects like Independent Curators International(ICI). And the many wonderful and enlightening journeys abroad with her will never be forgotten. In our sadness and loss, we offer condolences to Nina's three children and extended family.

2014-08-17T00:00:00Z,"PROSKAUER--Paul F.,Ph.D., son of the late Dr. Curt and Erna Proskauer and brother of the late Henry G. Proskauer passed away on August 9th. He was born in Breslau, Germany in 1921 and attended a humanistic Gymnasium (Johannesgymnasium) (Latin, French, Greek) for 7 ++ years until November 9, 1938 (Kristallnacht). In June 1939 he had to leave Germany with his parents and went to Italy to await there the issuance of the immigration visas to USA. From September 1939 until May 1940 he lived in Rome. Since his father who was a dentist in Breslau where he had published in 1926 the first pictorial history of Dentistry Iconographia Odontologica' and had also had from 1926 to 1933 in Berlin position of Director of the Research Institute for History of Dentistry Forschungsinstitut fur Goschichte der Zahnheilkunde - because of this and because of his personal acquaintance with the dentist of Pope Pius XII: Dr. A Piperno - he received permission to do research work in the Vatican Library in the field of history of dentistry. And it was the Vatican Library - possibly Cardinal Tisserant - who asked the Italian Steamship Company to reduce the fare from Italy to New York by 50% thus enabling the Proskauer family to leave Italy before Italy entered the war. His parents and Paul arrived in New York on May 23rd, 1940 and his brother Henry already in April 1940 - coming directly from Zurich to Naples and then to New York. His brother Henry had attended the ETH (Eidgebossische Technische Hochschule) in Zurich, Switzerland from 1935 until 1940 where he had studied architecture - where Prof. Salvisberg had been an outstanding architect and Henry's Professor. Paul attended in New York at first for eight months George Washington High School at night and took the Regents exams in English, American History and American Government in June 1941. In September 1941 he was admitted to attend the School of Business and Civic Administration of the College of the City of New York (now Baruch College) and graduated in 1945 ""cum laude"". He then worked for an export company for a few years, to earn money and began graduate studies in German Literature in 1959: he received a Master's Degree from Hunter College and his Doctorate (Ph.D.) in 1966 from the Department of Germanic Languages at Columbia University. He taught full time German Language and Literature courses at Hunter College, then Hunter College in the Bronx which was named eventually Lehman College for nearly 30 years and retired as Professor Emeritus. He is not survived by any member of his family. His grandmother on his father's side: Selma Proskauer was distantly related to Federal Appeal Court Judge Jacob Trieber was killed in an extermination camp and his uncle (his mother's brother). Dr. Willy Cohn - a specialist in the Hohenstuffen-era - was shot with his wife and two small daughters in Lithuania November 1941. His father's sister Ella Brinnitzer was killed in Auschwitz with her husband. When Paul was an undergraduate he was accepted by the College Honorary Society Sigma Alpha and after graduation by the National Honorary Society for students of Business Colleges 'Beta Gamma Sigma' (the scholastic equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa). His father Dr. Curt received shortly before his death in 1972 the Order of Merit from the German Government. 'Das Grosse Bundesverdienstkreuz'. Paul and his brother had decided to donate their book - and art collection to the Kantons - Library in Schwyz, Switzerland. Henry had already given three works of German Expressionism an Oil by Otto Mueller and two watercolors by Erich Heckel to the Brucke Museum in Berlin and had previously donated an architectural drawing by Poelzig to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Both Henry and Paul were members if Modern Art for more than 50 years. During the last few years of his life Paul was happy when he could attend symphony and chamber music concerts in Carnegie Hall which he tried to support in his way. Paul was especially grateful for the personal interest and kindness of the three Rodriguez sisters: Rachel, Jennifer and Cindy who in their twenties had also known Henry and were good friends and companions. It was Paul's special wish to express to Dr. Jerry Gliklich and his wonderful secretary Ms. Joan how grateful he was for the extraordinary care and personal interest Dr. Gliklich had for many years shown to both brothers.

A brilliant musician, lyricist and advertising genius, Bob graduated from Carnegie Mellon, served in Korea then began his career at McCann Erikson in the 1950's. He moved to Benton & Bowels where he was a creative director on Post Cereals. In 1964 he and Arch Nadler founded Nadler&Larimer which grew into a thriving advertising agency handling accounts such as Austin Nichols and Faberge. Bob created the highly-acclaimed Brut TV commercials -- interviews with athletes Joe Namath, Willie Mays and Jimmy Connors. The agency was sold to Mickleberry in 1980. He later joined his wife, Riki Kane, in her housewares company, Metrokane inc. Together they built a multi-million dollar business focusing on wine accessories, specifically the Rabbit and Houdini brands. The key to the company's success was Bob's advertising expertise. The Rabbit brand became famous world-wide and was advertised consistently in The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker. Beyond his stunning career in advertising and marketing, Bob's first love was musical theater. Over the years he created several off-broadway and one broadway show, ""But Never Jam Today"" directed by Vinette Caroll. He wrote the music and lyrics for the last song recorded by Marlene Dietrich, ""The World Goes Rolling On."" This past June, he completed a concept album ""Maxie's"" an original jazz musical featuring vocalists Billy Porter, Jason Alexander, Heather Headley, Shirley Jones, Ruben Studdard, John Schneider and Jennifer Holliday. Much of Bob's music can be heard on his website..www.songsby boblarimer.com. A true renaissance man, Bob was a horticulturist and a voracious reader, devouring books on politics and history. In Watermill, his favorite pastime was reading on his deck overlooking the lake and enjoying beautiful sunsets. In New York, his favorite pastime was composing music and playing his grand piano for hours on end. On Tuesday nights, he loved playing poker with his cronies. When he was younger he loved tennis. When they were hitting, he loved the Yankees. But most of all, he loved his wife and partner in life, Riki Kane Larimer. Their relationship spanned over five decades; they simply adored each other. In addition to his wife Riki, he leaves his son Neil (Kathy) daughter Cheryl (Jaime) granddaughters Heather, Vanessa and Gabriela; grandsons Alan and Robby, great-grandson Carter, brother-in-law Michael Kane of Los Angeles and his adorable puppy Miki who will miss snuggling up with him under the covers every night.

A devoted wife of 60 years to her late husband, Dr. Argyrios John Golfinos, she is survived by three loving children, all Princetonians, Terina A. Golfinos (husband Robert Lisi), Dr. Anastasia G. Daifotis (husband Christopher) and Dr. John G. Golfinos (wife Stephanie), and six adored grandchildren (Alexander, Helen and Christine Daifotis and Jason, Chloe and Phoebe Golfinos), three of whom have also matriculated at Princeton. Born in Ioannina, Greece in 1929, she emigrated to the United States in 1955 to pursue an advanced degree at Teachers College, Columbia University. Known affectionately as ""Mrs. G,"" she touched countless lives, young and old, with her genuine warmth, insightful mind and zest for life. From her favorite local hot dog vendor to Queen Frederika of Greece, for whom she sang as a young student, she made every person whose path she crossed feel as if they were the center of her universe. She will be remembered as a voracious reader, a marathon walker, a puzzle-a-day solver and an intrepid beachcomber, but, most of all, as a passionate advocate for each child's right to be healthy, happy and strong. She will remain an inspiration to her family and friends as the personification of grace under pressure and of pure unconditional love. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Making Headway Foundation at www.makingheadway.org."

2014-08-17T00:00:00Z,"DEANS--Robert Barr, Jr. passed away peacefully on August 13th, 2014 at Glen Cove Hospital. Bob was born on April 9, 1925 in Buffalo, New York. He was the son of Robert B. Deans (""Sheriff"") and Lucy Bemis Pomeroy Deans. His younger sister, Lucy Pomeroy Deans Hanes predeceased him in 1977. He grew up in New York City and Aiken, South Carolina and attended The Buckley School in New York and Aiken Preparatory School in South Carolina. In 1939, he entered St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire as a member of the Third Form and he graduated in 1943. Following his graduation from St. Paul's, he enlisted in the United States Navy V-12 officer training program in Rochester, New York and served on the west coast until the end of World War II. At the conclusion of the war, he enrolled at Yale University under the G.I. Bill and graduated in 1947 with a degree in economics. After his graduation from Yale, Bob worked for New York Trust Company, Fiduciary Counsel, and Lehman Brothers until 1951 when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. In 1952, he married Elisabeth DeBoeck Prickett in Wilmington, Delaware and started working for Chase National Bank. Bob and Elise spent several years in Vienna, Zurich, and Beirut where Bob was on loan to various foreign banks while working for Chase. They traveled extensively, had many extraordinary experiences, and made many long-standing friends. During this time, Bob and Elise were accompanied in their travels by their oldest daughter, Mary, and their two sons who were born abroad (Rob in Zurich in 1954 and Gil in Beirut in 1956). Bob and Elise returned to New York in 1957 and took up residence in Mill Neck on Long Island at ""Turbillon"" where he lived until his death. Upon returning to New York in 1957, Bob joined Van Strum & Towne and, while working there between 1957 and 1967, he earned an M.B.A. from New York University and had two more children (Nick in 1957, Elisabeth in 1960). In 1967, Bob and several close friends and colleagues founded Inverness Counsel. He worked there as Chairman/CEO until, in 2011, he assumed the role of Chairman Emeritus. Even in his role as Chairman Emeritus, Bob never stopped actively consulting with his fellow partners and advising his long-time contacts. His memberships included The Racquet and Tennis Club, The Creek, Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, Beaver Dam Winter Sports Club, the Boone and Crockett Club and, for a short time, the Colony Club. In 1963, Bob and his long-time neighbors and friends William T. Dunn, Jr. and Leonard L. Marshall, Jr. founded the North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary in Mill Neck and he served on the Executive Committee until his death. His first wife, Elise, pre-deceased him in 2001 and Bob was fortunate to spend his final years with his second wife, Shirley Blakeley of Livingston, Montana, whom he married in 2008. Bob is survived by his five children Mary L. C. Flood, Robert Barr Deans III (Janet), William Prickett Deans (Wendy), Nicholas Wyeth Deans (Barbara), and Elisabeth Suzanne DeBoeck Mooney. He is also survived by his grandchildren Caroline Whitney Deans and Robert Barr Deans IV (children of Rob and Janet), Katharine Hale Mooney (daughter of Elisabeth), and Jeremy Luke Frazier (step-son of Nicholas). He is also survived by an enormous extended family of friends and relatives with whom he interacted actively throughout his life. A private interment will be held at Valley Forge Memorial Chapel. A memorial service is scheduled for October 10, 2014 at 11:00am at Christ Church in Oyster Bay. In lieu of flowers, Bob has requested that donations be made to North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary (P.O.

2014-08-17T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Arthur G. It is with overwhelming sadness that the family of Arthur G. Cohen announces his sudden and untimely passing on August 9th at the age of 84 in Kings Point, New York, his home for decades with the love of his life, Karen Bassine Cohen. Arthur and Karen recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, a joyous occasion shared with their devoted daughters, Lauren, Susan, Debra, Rochelle and Kathy, nine wonderful grandchildren Allison, Hanni, Caroline, Jennifer, Charlie, Kate, William, Emily and Henry - who made him proud and brought him much joy, sons-in-law Jeffrey, Mark and Jeigh, grandson-in-law Matthew and other members of his extended family, who survive him and, with Karen, will miss the wisdom, boundless energy, generosity and love of their family patriarch. Arthur is also survived by his sister, Marilyn Davimos; his brother, Richard M. Cohen, predeceased him. For more than 50 years Arthur enjoyed an illustrious career as a builder, developer, investor, owner and manager of real estate throughout the United States and abroad, having earned a legendary reputation as a pioneer in revitalizing Times Square through his ownership interest in the iconic, landmarked Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway and his development of the 1500 Broadway office tower and the Crowne Plaza, Paramount and Michelangelo hotels. His foresight in recognizing the potential of the far west side of midtown Manhattan produced the Westyard office-warehouse facility at 450 West 33rd Street, around which an entire new community is now burgeoning, the Worldwide Plaza mixed-use complex at Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets on the site of the former Madison Square Garden and 888 Seventh Avenue, across from Carnegie Hall. Arthur's innovative ideas produced many other distinctive, high-profile projects such as the Peninsula Hotel and Olympic Tower in New York City and Aventura in North Miami, Florida. Though Arthur preferred to maintain a low profile, he often partnered with many of the most active and renowned developers, property managers and financial investors of the last 50 years and today, who consider him a trailblazer in creating new ways of structuring and financing real estate transactions. Born in Brooklyn, New York to Frances and L.D. Cohen, Arthur graduated from the University of Miami and New York Law School. Though he became an attorney admitted to the New York Bar and remained so for more than 50 years, he entered the real estate field in a small way shortly after completing law school, but moved rapidly to developing department store properties and retail centers and, in 1971 at the age of 40, to creating Arlen Realty & Development, then the nation's largest publicly-held real estate enterprise, with a vast portfolio of office buildings, hotels, single- and multi-family residential buildings and more than 250 shopping centers worldwide, as well as the E. J. Korvette department store chain. Always available to share his expertise and numerous real estate industry and financial market connections with both his contemporaries and the next generation of real estate and other business entrepreneurs, Arthur never ceased to enjoy the constant flow of potential worldwide projects brought to him by admirers of his ""laser beam"" analytical skills and remarkable physical stamina, which he also exhibited in his ""scratch"" golf game frequently on display at Old Westbury's Glen Oaks Country Club and the Palm Beach Country Club. But no diversion from his intense work ethic gave Arthur greater pleasure than sailing with his family on Long Island Sound in his cherished vintage sailboat ""Les Girls"", named to honor his wife and five daughters. In addition to Arthur's business and recreational pursuits, he was involved in numerous educational, professional and philanthropic activities, including guest lectureships at the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School of Business, directorships of Citicorp and the Home Title Division of Chicago Title Insurance Company and a trusteeship of the John Hancock Mutual Fund. His public service internationally included membership on the Special Mission to Israel under Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and as Special Envoy to aid underprivileged nations under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Often recognized by his real estate industry peers and the broader business community, among his honors are having been named Man of the Year by the Anti-Defamation League and the City of Hope and having received the Tree of Life Award from the Jewish National Fund and an honorary degree from Long Island University. His memberships on Boards of Trustees have included Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, Brandeis University (Emeritus), New York Law School and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The family requests that their wishes for a private funeral service and interment be respected. Donations may be made in memory of Arthur to the Anti-Defamation League, which he previously served as President."

Deans (""Sheriff"") and Lucy Bemis Pomeroy Deans. His younger sister, Lucy Pomeroy Deans Hanes predeceased him in 1977. He grew up in New York City and Aiken, South Carolina and attended The Buckley School in New York and Aiken Preparatory School in South Carolina. In 1939, he entered St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire as a member of the Third Form and he graduated in 1943. Following his graduation from St. Paul's, he enlisted in the United States Navy V-12 officer training program in Rochester, New York and served on the west coast until the end of World War II. At the conclusion of the war, he enrolled at Yale University under the G.I. Bill and graduated in 1947 with a degree in economics. After his graduation from Yale, Bob worked for New York Trust Company, Fiduciary Counsel, and Lehman Brothers until 1951 when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. In 1952, he married Elisabeth DeBoeck Prickett in Wilmington, Delaware and started working for Chase National Bank. Bob and Elise spent several years in Vienna, Zurich, and Beirut where Bob was on loan to various foreign banks while working for Chase. They traveled extensively, had many extraordinary experiences, and made many long-standing friends. During this time, Bob and Elise were accompanied in their travels by their oldest daughter, Mary, and their two sons who were born abroad (Rob in Zurich in 1954 and Gil in Beirut in 1956). Bob and Elise returned to New York in 1957 and took up residence in Mill Neck on Long Island at ""Turbillon"" where he lived until his death. Upon returning to New York in 1957, Bob joined Van Strum & Towne and, while working there between 1957 and 1967, he earned an M.B.A. from New York University and had two more children (Nick in 1957, Elisabeth in 1960). In 1967, Bob and several close friends and colleagues founded Inverness Counsel. He worked there as Chairman/CEO until, in 2011, he assumed the role of Chairman Emeritus. Even in his role as Chairman Emeritus, Bob never stopped actively consulting with his fellow partners and advising his long-time contacts. His memberships included The Racquet and Tennis Club, The Creek, Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club, Beaver Dam Winter Sports Club, the Boone and Crockett Club and, for a short time, the Colony Club. In 1963, Bob and his long-time neighbors and friends William T. Dunn, Jr. and Leonard L. Marshall, Jr. founded the North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary in Mill Neck and he served on the Executive Committee until his death. His first wife, Elise, pre-deceased him in 2001 and Bob was fortunate to spend his final years with his second wife, Shirley Blakeley of Livingston, Montana, whom he married in 2008. Bob is survived by his five children Mary L. C. Flood, Robert Barr Deans III (Janet), William Prickett Deans (Wendy), Nicholas Wyeth Deans (Barbara), and Elisabeth Suzanne DeBoeck Mooney. He is also survived by his grandchildren Caroline Whitney Deans and Robert Barr Deans IV (children of Rob and Janet), Katharine Hale Mooney (daughter of Elisabeth), and Jeremy Luke Frazier (step-son of Nicholas). He is also survived by an enormous extended family of friends and relatives with whom he interacted actively throughout his life. A private interment will be held at Valley Forge Memorial Chapel. A memorial service is scheduled for October 10, 2014 at 11:00am at Christ Church in Oyster Bay. In lieu of flowers, Bob has requested that donations be made to North Shore Wildlife Sanctuary (P.O. Box 214, Mill Neck, NY 11765)."

She made her Met debut in the role with which she was most associated, Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, and went on to sing more than 400 performances of 17 roles. She was particularly celebrated for the vulnerability and emotional immediacy of her portrayals of such tragic heroines as Cio-Cio-San, Mimi in Puccini's La Boheme, and Violetta in Verdi's La Traviata, a role she sang more frequently than any soprano in the Met's 131-year history. When she retired from the stage, she continued to pass on the traditions of Italian opera through teaching and her foundation for young singers, and for decades was a fixture at Met opening nights, enthusiastically joining in the traditional pre-performance singing of the national anthem.

He was the son of the late Sebastian and Agatha D' Aquila of Middletown, Connecticut. Born in Middletown on April 6, 1923, he was educated in Middletown schools and served as a Medic in the 11th Armored Division during World War II, under Gen. Patton. He was in the Battle of the Bulge and was the only surviving medic of the 11th Division at the end of the war. He received a Purple Heart and was a witness to the horrors of the death camp Mauthausen as a member of the liberating force. Following the war, John was graduated from Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT and from Catholic University of America School of Law in Washington, DC. He worked for many years as an attorney for U.S.F.&G. in New York City. He was an avid theatre goer, and was an opera and symphonic music lover. He enjoyed reading and discussing books, collecting art and was a talented master cook. He loved to travel, visited many countries and made livelong friends wherever he went. When he retired and moved to Belle Terre, he became absorbed in a new phase of his life. He was appointed to the board of directors of Theatre3, in Port Jefferson. The artistic director at Theatre3 wrote ""From The Fires; Voices of the Holocaust"" a play based in part on John's experiences at Camp Mauthausen and presented mostly in grade schools. John attended some presentations and answered questions after the play about what he had personally seen. He felt he needed to bear witness and share his experiences. John became a gifted public speaker, educating young people.

2014-08-20T00:00:00Z,"MROZ--John Edwin. The EastWest Institute (EWI) Board of Directors is deeply saddened by the loss of John Edwin Mroz, founder, CEO and visionary leader of the institute. We salute this exceptional man, a major international figure of our times, who has made a real difference in the world for over 30 years. John's inspiration, boundless energy and creativity gave birth to new ways of reducing conflict that have stood the test of time. John embodied the values that have made EWI successful by bringing diverse people together to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. John was the recipient of numerous international awards, including the Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany, for the role he and EWI played in facilitating German reunification. He was also awarded the highest civilian awards given to non-citizens by the presidents of Slovakia and Romania. Early in his career, John contacted the Reagan Administration and received approval to conduct a series of clandestine conversations with the Palestinian leadership, as there were no formal talks permitted at the time because of the PLO's failure to recognize the state of Israel. He met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat more than 50 times over three years. Moving quickly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, John opened a European headquarters in Prague. He reinvented the institute to deal with the full array of challenges associated with the post-communist transitions of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including political and economic reform and new arrangements of international security. John later opened satellite offices in Warsaw, Budapest, Kiev, and Moscow. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he advanced the Institute's reach to Central Asia and China, anticipating the shift in global power. EWI's work now includes efforts to establish a stronger US-China relationship. EWI is pioneering a rigorous focus on the international challenges of cybersecurity, holding the first worldwide summit in 2010 in Dallas. Additional work focuses on the challenges of food, water and energy. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Karen Linehan Mroz, President of the Middle East Children's Institute (MECI) and three children--Jonathan, Jessica and Jeffrey--and grandchild Noel Isabella Mroz. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be given in John's name to his beloved EastWest Institute www.ewi.info/donate. Ross Perot, Jr., Chairman of the Board The EastWest Institute"

2014-08-21T00:00:00Z,"MROZ--John Edwin. The EastWest Institute (EWI) Board of Directors is deeply saddened by the loss of John Edwin Mroz, founder, CEO and visionary leader of the institute. We salute this exceptional man, a major international figure of our times, who has made a real difference in the world for over 30 years. John's inspiration, boundless energy and creativity gave birth to new ways of reducing conflict that have stood the test of time. John embodied the values that have made EWI successful by bringing diverse people together to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. John was the recipient of numerous international awards, including the Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany, for the role he and EWI played in facilitating German reunification. He was also awarded the highest civilian awards given to non-citizens by the presidents of Slovakia and Romania. Early in his career, John contacted the Reagan Administration and received approval to conduct a series of clandestine conversations with the Palestinian leadership, as there were no formal talks permitted at the time because of the PLO's failure to recognize the state of Israel. He met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat more than 50 times over three years. Moving quickly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, John opened a European headquarters in Prague. He reinvented the institute to deal with the full array of challenges associated with the post-communist transitions of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including political and economic reform and new arrangements of international security. John later opened satellite offices in Warsaw, Budapest, Kiev, and Moscow. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he advanced the Institute's reach to Central Asia and China, anticipating the shift in global power. EWI's work now includes efforts to establish a stronger US-China relationship. EWI is pioneering a rigorous focus on the international challenges of cybersecurity, holding the first worldwide summit in 2010 in Dallas. Additional work focuses on the challenges of food, water and energy. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Karen Linehan Mroz, President of the Middle East Children's Institute (MECI) and three children--Jonathan, Jessica and Jeffrey--and grandchild Noel Isabella Mroz. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be given in John's name to his beloved EastWest Institute www.ewi.info/donate. Ross Perot, Jr., Chairman of the Board The EastWest Institute"
2014-08-21T00:00:00Z,"McGOVERN--Richard Gordon, 87, of South Kingstown, RI, passed away on Tuesday, August 19, 2014, at home. Long after retiring as president of Pepperidge Farm and Campbell Soup, Gordon McGovern straightened shelves of bread and soup cans in grocery stores, and hardly a visitor left his home without a bag of cookies. Born in Norristown, Pennsylvania in 1926 to James and Marion (Stritzinger) McGovern, Richard Gordon McGovern graduated cum laude from Brown University in 1948 and received his MBA from Harvard in 1950. Starting as a management trainee sweeping floors for Pepperidge Farm, McGovern was named president of the company in 1968. He became Chief Executive Officer of the parent company, Campbell Soup, in 1980, and retired in December 1989. At both companies McGovern gained national recognition for the introduction of innovative products, including the 100% Natural Soup line. McGovern's business drive was fueled by a voracious curiosity. He traveled far and wide, hitch-hiking cross-country as a high school student and leading his grandchildren through the countrysides of France and Ireland. He read just as widely, as happy to pick up People magazine as he would a history of World War II naval battles. (McGovern served as a navy radar officer during the Korean War and in later years was very proud to wear his USS Arnold J. Isbell hat). He would shop for groceries in towns he visited, often discussing products and displays with the store manager. He took great pleasure each day working the daily crossword puzzles with Judy, his wife of 59 years, looking up obscure clues in his vast array of almanacs and reference books. A strong believer in education, McGovern gave generous support to universities, libraries and schools. He received an honorary doctorate from Johnson and Wales University, was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi scholastic honor societies, was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and served on the boards of Wheaton College and the Wooster School. His family field trips and dinner table quizzes on geography and current events are remembered by his four children and their many school friends. Family croquet matches capped a life-long love of sports. McGovern was a state-ranked tennis player in high school, and was on the pitcher's mound at Williams College when VJ day was declared in 1945. A modest man of deep moral conviction, McGovern was proud of his record of never closing a production plant at Pepperidge Farm and Campbell Soup. For years, he folded his 6'4 frame into his beloved yellow Volkswagen beetle for his corporate commute. An avid vegetable gardener, McGovern liked to plant new crops to challenge his green thumb. Gordon McGovern died at his home in Green Hill Beach, Rhode Island, on August 19, cared for by Judy and by his children. He is survived by daughters Lucinda McGovern, Jennifer McGovern and husband Steve Unruhe, and Mindy McGovern and husband Mark Fuller, son Douglas McGovern and wife Galen McGovern, and ten grandchildren: Molly Thomson, Seth Procter, Katherine Mae Unruhe, Mark Procter, Rebecca Procter, Hannah Fuller, Michael McGovern, Matthew McGovern, Graham Fuller and Daniel McGovern. His death was preceded by the deaths of his brothers Lane and Bruce McGovern. The family will hold a private ceremony. Persons wishing to make memorial contributions are directed to the Rhode Island Food Bank, the South Kingstown Land Trust, Home and Hospice Care of Rhode Island, or a charity of choice."

2014-08-23T00:00:00Z,"KEZER--Valerie Vreeland, 83, of Bailey Island, ME, died August 20, 2014 at the family home. She was sitting on the porch, looking out on a cloudless Maine day and the sparkling water of Casco Bay when she was stricken with a fatal heart attack. Schooled in Caldwell, NJ, she attended the Parson School of Design in New York City. Forced by circumstances to support herself at any early age she was hired by Time, Inc. first as a page and later, because of her artistic abilities and her presentation skills, she worked in the promotion department of Life magazine. She was married on January 30, 1954 and lived in Athens, GA, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Shrewsbury, NJ and finally, Brunswick, ME. She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Richard, and four daughters; Sandra, Allison, Gail and Ann. A fifth daughter, Leslie died of leukemia at age 10. She is also survived by her grandchildren; Brian, Carolyn, Tom, Scott, Duncan, Allison, Jasper, Olivia, Oliver, Meg and John who each loved their Nana as she loved them. Because of two back operations several years ago her mobility was limited but, as with other challenges in her life, she rose above the challenge and brought joy and kindness into many lives. She loved to read, cook, travel the world, follow the successes of family members and stay in touch with old friends. Fittingly, when she died she was browsing through a copy of The Flavor of Maine looking for a recipe for dinner. Her passing leaves an enormous void in the lives of every member of her family and all her friends. No one who knew her could help but recall her smile, her sense of humor, her wisdon, her compassion and her good advice on matters large and small. A Memorial service will be private. Donations in Valerie's memory may be made to Camp Sunshine, a retreat for children with life threatening illnesses and their families, 35 Acadia Road, Casco Bay, ME 04015 or the Curtis Memorial Library, 23 Pleasant Street, Brunswick, ME 04011."

2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,"RITHOLZ--Gerald ""Jerry"". Gerald ""Jerry"" Ritholz, 81, passed away in his Las Vegas home on August 2, 2014. He was preceded by Ray Jarvis, his life partner; his parents Samuel J. Ritholz and Sylvia Silverstein Ritholz; and brother, Richard A. Ritholz. Among his surviving family members are his nephew, Jeffrey S. Ritholz, in New York, and niece, Susan K. Ritholz, in New York. Jerry also has several remaining cousins: Lois Neiman Kempner in New Jersey, Warren Neiman in Arizona, Arna Silvers Baker in Illinois, Alan Silvers in Georgia, Kenneth Silvers in New York, Jules Ritholz in Illinois, Robert Ritholz in Illinois, and Edward Bedno in Illinois. Born in Chicago on September 25, 1932, Jerry enjoyed a childhood fascination with Gilbert and Sullivan, whose work inspired him to perform puppet shows of his own for his friends. At age 11, Jerry's interest in the arts was fueled when his father's aunt introduced him to the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. Inspired by these broadcasts, he began to develop miniature sets of his own and collect phonograph records. While attending Lakeview High School, Jerry's artistic interest grew to include music as he began to compose original scores. Encouraged by his music teacher and his father's gift of season tickets to the Chicago Symphony, Jerry soon aspired to become a set designer. After high school, Jerry briefly attended the University of Illinois at Navy Pier to study business education. His love for the theatre, however, took over when he accepted the opportunity to work with the University's drama department. With the realization that his life's work belonged in the arts, Jerry transferred to The Goodman Theater of Arts Institute of Chicago. After graduating from the Goodman Theater, Jerry's dream of becoming a professional set designer was soon realized, and his work was showcased by several famous dance companies, drawing rave reviews from Ruth Page, Claudia Cassidy and the Chicago Ballet Guild. Jerry's set design talent eventually led him to New York City, where he also began buying and selling artwork. When a new opera company in Chicago advertised for singers and dancers, Jerry seized the opportunity to present his portfolio. He was quickly hired and relocated back to Chicago by co-founder and former general manager of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Carol Fox, and opera producer, Larry Kelly. Designing sets for Lyric Opera was Jerry's primary occupation and passion for many years. During his career with the Chicago Metropolitan Opera, Jerry brought his creative talent as set designer to ""The Taming of the Shrew"", ""Aida"", ""Le Nozze Di Figaro"" and ""Fedora"" just to name a few of many operas. He became lifelong friends with soprano, Maria Callas, world renowned opera singer who died at the age of 53. Jerry took a hiatus from the art world, however, to attend to the needs of his family when his father became ill. During this time, he worked very briefly for the family business, King Optical Company. His business travels led him to eight states as well as Ontario, Canada. On the side, Jerry continued to purchase artwork and graphics, frame them, and sell them to department stores in Chicago. Urged by his aunt and uncle to advertise his business venture in Decor Magazine, Jerry achieved success outside of the family business to the point where in 1970, he started a company of his own: Mixed Media, Ltd. With the support of his business and life partner Ray Jarvis, who suggested that they switch from black and white to color advertisements in their catalogue, Mixed Media, Ltd. became one of the most successful wholesale poster art distributors in the United States. Jerry met Ray Jarvis, in 1976 when Jerry accompanied his mother on the Royal Caribbean Nordic Prince cruise ship. At the time, Ray was the ship's assistant cruise director and was also a former acquaintance - Jerry and Ray met for the first time in 1956 at the Music Theater in Highland Park, Illinois. Jerry and Ray's relationship developed quickly and after four more cruises together, they decided to establish residence with one another in Chicago. Years later, in search of a better climate, the couple moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they ultimately sold their business and retired. Jerry and Ray enjoyed a deeply committed and loving relationship together for 33 years before Ray's passing in 2009. Jerry was a staunch supporter of the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas, as well as an active donor and member of the Golden Rainbow. He was surrounded by many close friends during his final years, which was a source of great joy, support, and comfort to him. His dying wish was to pass away peacefully in his home, which he did. The Ritholz family extends heartfelt gratitude to all of Jerry's friends who demonstrated their love, care and concern for Jerry throughout his life and until the time of his passing. Particularly, the family wishes to express their appreciation for the many years of devotion by long-time friend, and former employee, Wayne S. Weiswasser of Las Vegas. At Jerry's request, there will be a ""Blast from the Past"" party in Las Vegas. Those who knew Jerry may contact 702-731-1926 for additional information. Donations in Jerry's name may be made by calling The Smith Center for the Performing Arts at 702-749-2012, The Golden Rainbow at 702-384-2899, or Nathan Adelson Hospice at 702-733-0320.

2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,"MUNROE--George B.,who led the copper mining and manufacturing company Phelps Dodge Corporation from 1969 to 1987, died painlessly and peacefully in his sleep on August 19. Munroe led Phelps Dodge through a difficult period for the domestic copper mining industry, as it struggled to meet growing competition from abroad and new environmental requirements at home. Munroe continued to increase the company's production as a new hydro-metallurgical process was developed to reduce the need for smelting in the production process and Phelps Dodge, which had been the third largest United States copper producer, emerged as the domestic industry leader and one of the largest producers in the world. Before joining Phelps Dodge, Munroe practiced law in New York as an associate with Cravath, Swain and Moore and Debevoise, Plimpton and McLean and worked in the Office of the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany in the early 1950's, serving first in Bonn as a lawyer and later in Nuremberg as a justice of the U.S Court of Restitution Appeals of the Allied High Commission. Munroe was a trustee of Dartmouth College for 14 years and the chairman of its board for three years. He was also a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, serving on several of it's committees for 25 years, and chairing the Museum's finance committee for 8 years. Other board memberships included the Henry Street Settlement, the YMCA of Greater New York and the Academy of Political Science, of which he was chairman for 10 years. He was a director of several major corporations, including the New York Life Insurance Company, the Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical banks, the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, Manville Corporation and New York Times Company and was a Public Governor of the New York Stock Exchange. His service in the Navy during World War II included duty as a combat information center officer on the battleship Maryland in the Pacific. The Maryland took part in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945, where it survived damage from Kamikazi plane attacks. As a young man, Munroe was an outstanding basketball player on three Ivy League championship teams at Dartmouth and led Dartmouth to the national championship game of the N.C.A.A. tournament in 1942. That year, he led the Eastern Intercollegiate League in scoring and was named to several All-America Teams. Later, while attending Harvard Law School, he played in the professional league for the St. Louis Bombers and Boston Celtics. Munroe graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School with honors and from Oxford University in England where he was a Rhodes Scholar. Munroe is survived by his wife of more than 45 years, Elinor Bunin Munroe, an artist and award-wining film maker, and by two sons by a previous marriage, Ralph of Orange, Virginia and Taylor of Atenas, Costa Rica and a grandson, Zachary.

2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,"MROZ--John Edwin. The EastWest Institute (EWI) Board of Directors is deeply saddened by the loss of John Edwin Mroz, founder, CEO and visionary leader of the institute. We salute this exceptional man, a major international figure of our times, who has made a real difference in the world for over 30 years. John's inspiration, boundless energy and creativity gave birth to new ways of reducing conflict that have stood the test of time. John embodied the values that have made EWI successful by bringing diverse people together to solve seemingly unsolvable problems. John was the recipient of numerous international awards, including the Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany, for the role he and EWI played in facilitating German reunification. He was also awarded the highest civilian awards given to non-citizens by the presidents of Slovakia and Romania. Early in his career, John contacted the Reagan Administration and received approval to conduct a series of clandestine conversations with the Palestinian leadership, as there were no formal talks permitted at the time because of the PLO's failure to recognize the state of Israel. He met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat more than 50 times over three years. Moving quickly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1989, John opened a European headquarters in Prague. He reinvented the institute to deal with the full array of challenges associated with the post-communist transitions of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including political and economic reform and new arrangements of international security. John later opened satellite offices in Warsaw, Budapest, Kiev, and Moscow. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he advanced the Institute's reach to Central Asia and China, anticipating the shift in global power. EWI's work now includes efforts to establish a stronger US-China relationship. EWI is pioneering a rigorous focus on the international challenges of cybersecurity, holding the first worldwide summit in 2010 in Dallas. Additional work focuses on the challenges of food, water and energy. We extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife Karen Linehan Mroz, President of the Middle East Children's Institute (MECI) and three children--Jonathan, Jessica and Jeffrey--and grandchild Noel Isabella Mroz.

Peter is survived by his wife Carol of 16 years, his daughter Sarah Underhill (Robert) of Bronx- ville, NY; son Eric (Mary) of Winnetka, IL, and stepson David (Janet) Moga of San Mateo, CA, and by eight grandchildren: Molly and Sam Underhill; Maddy, Tim, Annie, and Ellie Mollman; and Zoe and Ava Moga. His marriage to Jane Kendall Mollman, in 1953, ended in divorce. Peter was born on February 8, 1931, in Belleville, IL. He earned his MA from Washington University in St. Louis in 1952. He spent his professional life in publishing in New York at Harper & Row and Random House, Inc., World Book in Chicago, and finally Microsoft in Seattle. In retirement, he channeled his immense creative energy into the design and development of an Italian food website: www.classicpasta.com. As Peter himself described it, one of the most delightful and memorable moments in his long publishing career was meeting Marcella and Victor Hazan and his subsequent role in the development of The Classic Italian Cookbook. Peter had signed up for an Italian cooking class with the Hazans in New York, in search of the food he had come to love in his travels; the authenticity of their food was nowhere to be found in American cookbooks at the time. A friendship and partnership were born, and the first edition of this seminal work on Northern Italian cooking was published by Peter at Harper's Magazine Press in 1973. His passions included art, music, travel, food and wine, and all things Italian, and his volunteer commitments reflected these interests. Peter had an exceptional zest for life, and his signature laugh was contagious. A celebration of his life will take place at his home in Carmel. Donations in Peter's honor may be made to the Carmel Public Library Foundation, PO Box 2042, Carmel, CA 93921-2042, (831)624-2881, http://carmelpubliclibrary foundation.org; or to Chamber Music Monterey Bay, PO Box 221458, Carmel, CA 93922, www.chambermusicmontereybay.org"

2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,"LAUGHLIN--Henry R. February 13, 1960 August 6, 2014. Henry Laughlin has passed unexpectedly at his home in San Francisco. Growing up in Norfolk, Connecticut, with roots in Wyoming, he spent time in Argentina and Chile before settling in San Francisco with Carlene, his wife; and there they would later welcome the births of Walker and Amelia, their children. He was currently serving on the board of the Alta Ski Lifts Company in Alta, Utah, the Snake River Associates and Crystal Springs Ranch in Wilson, Wyoming. In Utah, the Andes of Chile and Argentina, the Tetons in Wyoming and the Sierras in California Henry was able to explore his passion for skiing. He enjoyed mountain-biking the trails of Wyoming and the Sierras as well as biking the beautiful roads of the Berkshires. Henry was an accomplished cabinetmaker. Alta benefited from his keen eye for design and perfectionist detail, and he contributed to the major elements in the buildings recently constructed at the Alta Ski Lifts Company. Henry is survived by his brother Paul Laughlin his wife Marian Gram Laughlin and their two sons James R. Laughlin and Hugh O. Laughlin, his sister Leila Laughlin Javitch her husband Daniel Javitch and their two daughters Arielle Javitch and Daphne Javitch. Above all, Henry was an immensely kind man, who gave generously his energy and enthusiasm to help others in need. Even a small gift of his latest discovery showed he had thought of you. So many will miss him not least his beloved dog, Bay. But Henry's own life was not easy. He suffered deeply from mental illness that would not allow him to support his own dreams, even as he supported the dreams of others. Now and in years to come, those who share mental illness such as Henry's will be helped not only by medication and therapy; but also by public awareness and discussion; open empathy with each individual patient, free of shame, prejudice, or judgment of any kind; and rigorous research.

2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,"KEZER--Valerie Vreeland, 83, of Bailey Island, ME, died August 20, 2014 at the family home. She was sitting on the porch, looking out on a cloudless Maine day and the sparkling water of Casco Bay when she was stricken with a fatal heart attack. Schooled in Caldwell, NJ, she attended the Parson School of Design in New York City. Forced by circumstances to support herself at any early age she was hired by Time, Inc. first as a page and later, because of her artistic abilities and her presentation skills, she worked in the promotion department of Life magazine. She was married on January 30, 1954 and lived in Athens, GA, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Shrewsbury, NJ and finally, Brunswick, ME. She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Richard, and four daughters; Sandra, Allison, Gail and Ann. A fifth daughter, Leslie died of leukemia at age 10. She is also survived by her grandchildren; Brian, Carolyn, Tom, Scott, Duncan, Allison, Jasper, Olivia, Oliver, Meg and John who each loved their Nana as she loved them. Because of two back operations several years ago her mobility was limited but, as with other challenges in her life, she rose above the challenge and brought joy and kindness into many lives. She loved to read, cook, travel the world, follow the successes of family members and stay in touch with old friends. Fittingly, when she died she was browsing through a copy of The Flavor of Maine looking for a recipe for dinner. Her passing leaves an enormous void in the lives of every member of her family and all her friends. No one who knew her could help but recall her smile, her sense of humor, her wisdon, her compassion and her good advice on matters large and small. A Memorial service will be private. Donations in Valerie's memory may be made to Camp Sunshine, a retreat for children with life threatening illnesses and their families, 35 Acadia Road, Casco Bay, ME 04015 or the Curtis Memorial Library, 23 Pleasant Street, Brunswick, ME 04011."

Born in 1923, Harold attended DeWitt Clinton High School and was a track star. Pearl Harbor was bombed while Harold was attending City College, and he immediately enlisted (needing his parents' permission because he was underage). Placing first in his class at Master Gunner School, he served as a Warrant Officer in the 9th Air Defense Command, 231 AAA Searchlight Battalion, specializing in reconnaissance. A problem solver, Harold single-handedly devised a mathematical solution to enable pilots to land at night. Previously, medium bomber pilots had been flying only daylight missions and there were heavy casualties. His solution saved hundreds and hundreds of lives of pilots who were now able to fly night missions without being seen by the enemy. After WWII, he married his sweetheart, Toby Nevins, the great love of his life for 53 years. President of A. Friedman & Co., a manufacturing jewelry firm in lower Manhattan, he was an exacting artist, taking pride in the craftsmanship of each piece. Harold was a brilliant raconteur and a light in the world, finding the humor in everything, lightening everyone's mood, refusing to say or hear anything negative about anyone. He loved music, especially from the big band era, sang in a choral group for many years, and was a wonderful dancer. He loved to laugh and to make others laugh, particularly at the bowling alley or over a spirited game of cards. Harold loved his family and was adored by them. He passed peacefully in his sleep, as gracefully as he lived. A unique man of warmth, integrity and humor, Harold has left a piece of himself in every heart that he touched through his long and loving life. He is reunited with his Toby. Harold is survived by daughters Lydia Jacobs (Jon) of Plantation, FL, and Nancy Friedman (Steve Posner) of Evergreen, CO; grandchildren Scott Golden, Melanie Golden (Glenn Hamburg), Jolie Portnoy (Bryan), Jay Jacobs (Kristin), Jared Jacobs, Daniel Friedman-Posner; and great-grandchildren Joshua, Isabella, Jeremy, and Jase."

2014-08-25T00:00:00Z,"MUNROE--George B.,who led the copper mining and manufacturing company Phelps Dodge Corporation from 1969 to 1987, died painlessly and peacefully in his sleep on August 19. Munroe led Phelps Dodge through a difficult period for the domestic copper mining industry, as it struggled to meet growing competition from abroad and new environmental requirements at home. Munroe continued to increase the company's production as a new hydro-metallurgical process was developed to reduce the need for smelting in the production process and Phelps Dodge, which had been the third largest United States copper producer, emerged as the domestic industry leader and one of the largest producers in the world. Before joining Phelps Dodge, Munroe practiced law in New York as an associate with Cravath, Swain and Moore and Debevoise, Plimpton and McLean and worked in the Office of the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany in the early 1950's, serving first in Bonn as a lawyer and later in Nuremberg as a justice of the U.S Court of Restitution Appeals of the Allied High Commission. Munroe was a trustee of Dartmouth College for 14 years and the chairman of its board for three years. He was also a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, serving on several of it's committees for 25 years, and chairing the Museum's finance committee for 8 years. Other board memberships included the Henry Street Settlement, the YMCA of Greater New York and the Academy of Political Science, of which he was chairman for 10 years. He was a director of several major corporations, including the New York Life Insurance Company, the Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical banks, the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, Manville Corporation and New York Times Company and was a Public Governor of the New York Stock Exchange. His service in the Navy during World War II included duty as a combat information center officer on the battleship Maryland in the Pacific. The Maryland took part in the invasion of Okinawa in 1945, where it survived damage from Kamikazi plane attacks. As a young man, Munroe was an outstanding basketball player on three Ivy League championship teams at Dartmouth and led Dartmouth to the national championship game of the N.C.A.A. tournament in 1942. That year, he led the Eastern Intercollegiate League in scoring and was named to several All-America Teams. Later, while attending Harvard Law School, he played in the professional league for the St. Louis Bombers and Boston Celtics. Munroe graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School with honors and from Oxford University in England where he was a Rhodes Scholar. Munroe is survived by his wife of more than 45 years, Elinor Bunin Munroe, an artist and award-wining film maker, and by two sons by a previous marriage, Ralph of Orange, Virginia and Taylor of Atenas, Costa Rica and a grandson, Zachary. Mr. Munroe decided not to have a funeral or memorial service. Contributions may be made to the George B.

2014-08-26T00:00:00Z,"FERGUSON--Fred T. Fred T. Ferguson, journalist, editor, and public relations professional died on Friday at New York Presbyterian Medical Center. He was eighty-two. A graduate of New York Military Academy, Ferguson, a veteran newsman with wide experience, began his career as a stringer on Pacific Stars and Stripes during the Korean War covering the southern Japanese Islands. In 1956, Ferguson began at United Press International as a copyboy, and worked his way up through the ranks of reporter and editor at bureaus in Jackson, MS, Mineaola, NY, Trenton and Newark, NJ. He later served as Regional Executive for New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. One of his fondest memories was escorting former President Harry S. Truman on his daily walks. In 1980, Ferguson won the New York Press Association's News Feature Award for a series he wrote on the advent of robotics in the US. Twenty-seven years later, Ferguson went onto begin his second career in Public Relations. After eight years at DAY (now Olgivy PR), PR Newswire hired him to coach their clients writing press releases. Public speaking expert, Dorothy Sarnoff, trained Ferguson to speak across the country on ""Writing press releases editors will notice."" A favorite phrase of his was: ""Now I'm a flack instead of a hack!"" Never retiring, he went on to start his own consulting company: Fred-Editing Help, after leaving PR Newswire at the age of 77. To say he loved his work would be understatement. A great story teller, Ferguson spoke last spring at the National Hemophilia Foundation's Annual Soiree where he was honored for his work on the board. An energetic person, who continued to be motivated by his longtime girlfriend, Gloria Marti, Ferguson danced, skied, played tennis, ice skated, traveled extensively and was an avid opera and theater goer. He also raised his two children by himself, for the most part, at a time when that was not the norm. His son, Dr. Robert Ferguson of Paxton, MA survives him as well as his daughter, former Mayor, Lisa Uchrin of Lebanon, NJ, his granddaughter, Kyla Ferguson of Leeds, MA and his two grandsons, Zachary Ferguson of Boston, MA and George Uchrin, age 14. He was their beloved ""Pop Pop."" In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Diabetes Association. Visitation with the family will be held at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave. on Friday, August 29, 2014 from 7-9:00pm."

2014-08-31T00:00:00Z,"SPOKOJNY--Artur M. Artur M. Spokojny, MD, FACC, Husband, Father, Medical Pioneer Dies at 58. Dr. Artur Manfred Spokojny, alternative cardiologist and internist, died on January 7th in Los Angeles, after a long, brave battle with his illness. He was buried in Sfat, Israel on Thursday, January 9th, 2014, resting place of beloved teacher, Kabbalist Rav Berg. Words cannot convey the love and respect Artur had for Rav and Karen Berg, who changed the course of his life and illness when they met in 1993. Services coincided with the Kaddish for Artur's father, Sen. Julius Spokojny; the Creator's hand is evident in such timing. Donations may be made for Dr. Artur Spokojny to KCI at 1108 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90035 for The Tel Aviv Beshalach Project, the Torah portion of his departure in which he shared an affinity. The Zohar's commentary on the Prophet Elijah, resonate deeply with Artur's extraordinary longevity in the face of terminal illness. Diagnosed in 1991 with rare Smoldering T-Cell Leukemia Lymphoma, he was given seven years to live. Artur was born in Augsburg, Germany on May 10th, 1955, on Lag B'Omer, Hebrew holiday and death anniversary of R. Shimon Bar Yochai, author of the Zohar. His connection to Kabbalah which began at birth would manifest many years later as the principles of the Zohar became his foundation for life-changing paradigm. In 1961, at age six, Artur's academic brilliance shined, he completed reading his first year textbook that very day. In secondary school, he sat for two grades in 1971 and began medical studies in 1973 completing at Ludwig-Maximillian-University of Munich in 1979. Artur was awarded the 'Studiendstiftung de Duetschen Volkes' scholarship in 1975 then sat for the Medical examinations completing in 1979. After internships, he was granted his 'Approbation als Arzt'-- medical license--in November 1979, Dr. Spokojny became Chair I Research Assistant in ""venous return"" at the Institute of Physiology, University of Dusseldorf, just shy of his 25th birthday, then spent a year at Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem. He widely published medical research here and abroad. In 1983, Dr. Spokojny was the first foreign student ever to be accepted into residency at Beth Israel of Harvard University Hospital in Boston, MA where he performed ground-breaking research on laser treatment for coronary disease and heart infection. From Beth Israel, NY in 1985, Dr. Spokojny joined the faculty at New York Hospital Cornell Medical University in 1989 as Assistant Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory. After Artur's diagnosis, he looked for alternatives to create a new paradigm for healing. Meeting Rav and Karen Berg solidified both the change in his outlook on life and medicine. Artur credited their relationship and healing modalities of the Zohar with prolonging his life. In 1996, he left Cornell creating Whole Heart Center of New York as an alternative cardiologist and internist. The doctor who's every move was for the love of Science perceived disease in a whole new light discovering modern medical breakthroughs recorded in the Zohar over 2000 before. Artur then lectured worldwide on science and spirituality and kabbalistic consciousness and healing techniques serving as advisor and researcher on projects reducing radiation levels of nuclear waste around the world. Artur, a unique combination of intellectual prowess with a penchant for mischief and mayhem, loved a good party, good friends, fine food, wine and single malt scotch. Whether discussing nuclear science and radioactive waste solutions with President Bill Clinton, the CEO of one of Europe's largest Nuclear Power Companies, or the United States Department of Energy during the George W. Bush administration, Artur commanded the floor earning respect with seriousness, brilliance and unconditional care for the welfare our of world. Artur was a gentleman's gentleman; to know him was to love him. His laugh was infectious, his dry sense of humor, zest for wisdom irresistible. A voracious literarian of historical and science fiction fantasy, spiritual, scientific and medical tomes, he loved Jewish, new age and classical music as well as classic rock, enjoyed travel, appreciated good movies, delighted in chocolate and making a good cup of coffee. Above all, Artur was a dedicated and loving husband and father. Artur and Melissa were married by Rav Berg and sons on August 24th, 1995, nine months to the day of their first date. They welcomed first daughter, Rachael, in July 1999, and second, Miriam, in April 2001. Artur developed family property in Augsburg, called Zobelpark naming Julius-Spokojny-Weg for his late father. Dr. Artur Spokojny is also survived by parents-in-law, Barbara and Irving Orenstein, sister in-law Laurie, husband Ken Goeringer, children Zachary, Jonathan and Erin, all of New York. In Israel, Aunt Sala Mateles, cousin Tovy and husband Eldad Malkin, children Rona, Ori and Tal, cousin Zeev Chayut and children Maya, Dor and Omer, cousin Hadassah Eckshtien, children Iaron, Sharon and Orit. In Germany, Cousin Heinrich Spokojny and wife Petra, their daughters Helen and Linda, her son Morris. Dr. Spokojny, missed by his many patients for whom it was his honor to serve and by his Kabbalah Centre family, chevre and community around the world, who enriched his life beyond measure--especially Meir Yeshurun, who stayed with him to the end. Artur lives in the hearts and souls of all those he touched. We will always love you, dear Artur."

2014-09-03T00:00:00Z,"ROBBINS--Irving Milton. Irving Milton Robbins, a mechanical engineer, who built a New York City engineering firm that has been a fixture in high rise residential and commercial real estate development in New York City for the last 57 years, died on August 31, 2014 at his home in New Rochelle, New York after a valient struggle with Merkel Cell Carcinoma. He was 88. Mr. Robbins was the founder of I.M. Robbins, PC engineering firm in Manhattan and was President of the business for over five decades. He worked with most of New York City's top architects and real estate developers, and was trusted and respected by everyone he knew. There is hardly a part of the New York City skyline that has not been touched by his firm. Coming from humble beginnings, Irv was born in 1926 to Bertha and Michael Robbins and grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn during the depression. He knew from a very young age that he wanted to get out from where he was and focused on being a good student. Upon skipping a number of grades in school, he was accepted to City College of New York at the age of 16. In the middle of his college years, he was drafted to serve in WWII and enlisted in the US Marine Corps. He was in the 4th division and fought in the Pacific theater at Iwo Jima and was awarded the purple heart. He was always very proud of his service to his country. Upon completing his tour of duty, Irv then reenrolled at City College and eventually completed his Masters in Mechanical Engineering thanks to the support of the GI bill. He was always grateful for the education he received at City College. Later in life, he established a scholarship program for the engineering school and was awarded membership to the Lavender Hill Mob. After graduating, recognizing the need for engineering expertise in the real estate industry, he started his consulting firm, which initially had clients throughout the country. In 1952, he married his wife Esther, who he first met at the age of 15 years at McKibben Street Park in Brooklyn. They just celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary. Irv's knowledge and experience was highly regarded in the real estate industry. He was licensed in 12 states, was a member of the National Society of Professional Engineers, American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, New York State Society of Professional Engineers, Professional Engineers in Private Practice and American Arbitration Association. As his business grew, the firm concentrated its work in New York City where he was a member of the Mayor's Task Force on Fire Safety, and recently a Member of the Mayor's task force for revision of the 2014 Mechanical Code. Irv was always generous with his time and served for many years on the Board of his condominium in Long Boat Key, Florida. He loved his Florida home and his one regret was that he did not retire early enough to spend more time there with his wife Esther. Up until the last days of his life, he continued to provide advice to his condominium Board on engineering and building issues. Irv enjoyed traveling, golf and reading, but most of all he loved spending time with his family. He is survived by his beloved wife, Esther, his loving children Susan, Marc and daughter-in-law Rise, David and daughter-in-law Joyce and Carol and son-in-law Richard. He also leaves behind his adoring grandchildren, Danielle, Jennifer, Oliver, Daniel, Samantha, Amy, Sarah, Michael, Matthew and Isabel. Services were held on September 1st at the Weinstein Memorial Chapel, 1652 Central Park Avenue, Yonkers, NY 10710. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in Irv's memory to CCNY Grove School of Engineering, 160 Convent Avenue, Shepard Hall, New York, NY 10031."

2014-09-03T00:00:00Z,"MULA--Lilia. 15 years ago, we moved to a cul de sac on East 52nd Street. Only one person in a co-op of five buildings encompassing 400 apartments sent Myrna and me a welcome note. Then she sent a welcome gift. Then she sent an invitation to come visit her. She made us feel welcome and embraced and she oozed likeability and trustability and was caring and generous of spirit (all under a platinum bee hive). When Christmas came, she was like a child, examining every ornament, every decoration and then contributing her own, overwhelming us with silly, frivolous and whimsical follies of wind-up toys. We became playmates. She came to see what we planted on the terrace, tasted of the pesto made from the roof-grown basil and embraced each dog we owned during the period we lived in the building with her and oohed and aahed over Sherpa's doggy calendars. Lila was never happy with the way the employees of our building who served us and who took care of us were treated by the ""management'. She made sure they had extra food, water, soft drinks and fruit. They became her extended family. She was hyper-vigilant to heavy snow storms, flooded subways, called their families, gave them pillows, chairs, blankets. She was Florence Nightingale on East 52nd Street. She was what has been characterized by a wise man as a ""perfect foul-weather friend"". Although she was a lady and never revealed anything indiscreet, she was encyclopedic in her knowledge of Emory Roth, the architectural background of our building, every neighbor who had been in the building and the unwritten building history. She knew, she shared and she never complained. Because of that, we never knew that she was terribly ill. She asked us to call her Mrs. Goldberg. She signed her letters to us as Mrs. Goldberg. And so, goodnight, Mrs. Goldberg. May you be in peace. You were a terrific friend, neighbor and left the earth a better place for having been on it. We will miss you. Myrna Freddie & Buddy Gershon"

(November 13, 1950 August 26, 2014), an acclaimed American cultural historian, photographer and author, and a joyous musician, died in a tragic bicycling accident near his home in Stone Ridge, New York. Born in Pasadena, California, Peter grew up in Guilford, Connecticut. He graduated from Haverford College in 1972. At the University of Texas at Austin, he earned his MA in Photography and American Studies in 1976 and his PhD in American Civilization in 1980 under the mentorships of Garry Winogrand and Dr. William H.

His early academic career led him to the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1980 where he became Professor of Art History, Chair of the Art History Department (2006-2010), and Director of the Study of the U.S. Institute for Scholars (formerly American Studies Institute). He retired in 2010, was named Professor Emeritus, and continued to teach until 2012.

When his most recent book Outside The Gates of Eden - The Dream of America from Hiroshima to Now was published in April, he was immersed in new projects, including a photographic and cultural study of the American freeway. Earlier books include Atomic Spaces: Living on the Manhattan Project (1997); William Henry Jackson and the Transformation of the American Landscape (1988); and Silver Cities: The Photography of American Urbanization, 1839-1915 (1984; revised and published in 2005); as well as numerous essays and articles, the spectrum of which reflect his broad areas of interest and expertise.

As an accomplished guitarist and songwriter, Peter sought out and found friendship, collaboration and community with musicians wherever he lived. As a passionate cyclist, Peter often rode over 200 miles a week with a team, a partner or solo. Beloved husband, dedicated father, loving brother and uncle, mentor and friend to many, Peter is survived by his wife Maureen Pskowski, son Taylor Hales, daughter Molly Hales, sisters, Susan Hales and Marty Hales.

2014-09-04T00:00:00Z,"MULA--Lilia. 15 years ago, we moved to a cul de sac on East 52nd Street. Only one person in a co-op of five buildings encompassing 400 apartments sent Myrna and me a welcome note. Then she sent a welcome gift. Then she sent an invitation to come visit her. She made us feel welcome and embraced and she oozed likeability and trustability and was caring and generous of spirit (all under a platinum bee hive). When Christmas came, she was like a child, examining every ornament, every decoration and then contributing her own, overwhelming us with silly, frivolous and whimsical follies of wind-up toys. We became playmates. She came to see what we planted on the terrace, tasted of the pesto made from the roof-grown basil and embraced each dog we owned during the period we lived in the building with her and oohed and aahed over Sherpa's doggy calendars. Lila was never happy with the way the employees of our building who served us and who took care of us were treated by the ""management'. She made sure they had extra food, water, soft drinks and fruit. They became her extended family. She was hyper-vigilant to heavy snow storms, flooded subways, called their families, gave them pillows, chairs, blankets. She was Florence Nightingale on East 52nd Street. She was what has been characterized by a wise man as a ""perfect foul-weather friend"". Although she was a lady and never revealed anything indiscreet, she was encyclopedic in her knowledge of Emory Roth, the architectural background of our building, every neighbor who had been in the building and the unwritten building history. She knew, she shared and she never complained. Because of that, we never knew that she was terribly ill. She asked us to call her Mrs. Goldberg. She signed her letters to us as Mrs. Goldberg. And so, goodnight, Mrs. Goldberg. May you be in peace. You were a terrific friend, neighbor and left the earth a better place for having been on it. We will miss you. Myrna Freddie & Buddy Gershon"

2014-09-06T00:00:00Z,"CASTLEMAN--Riva. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the death of Riva Castleman, legendary print curator, who worked at the Museum from 1963 to 1995. Riva first joined MoMA's Department of Prints and Illustrated Books as a cataloger; in 1976 she became Director of Prints and Illustrated Books, and in 1986 she was named Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs, a position she held in addition to her work as Director of Prints and Illustrated Books until she retired in June 1995. Recognizing the significance of prints and illustrated books as important expressions of modern art, Riva organized dozens of exhibitions and catalogues that helped to advance scholarship in the field and convey the importance of these mediums to a wider audience. Her efforts resulted in many landmark publications that remain standard references today, including Prints of the Twentieth Century: A History (1976), Printed Art: A View of Two Decades (1980), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1985), Jasper Johns: A Print Retrospective (1987), and A Century of Artists Books (1994). Her work inspired a generation of curators and collectors, and her passion and dedication ensured that MoMA's collection of prints and illustrated books would remain the premier collection of its kind in the world. Her legacy is also reflected in two innovative initiatives that continue to provide support to the Museum and that have influenced other museums around the world. In 1975 she organized the Print Associates, the first collectors' group affiliated with a curatorial department at the Museum. She conceived of an endowment earmarked for the acquisition of prints and illustrated books, also a first for a curatorial department at the Museum. Her astute intelligence, sharp eye, and exacting standards left a mark on all who had the good fortune to know or work with her, and she will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Riva's niece, Kristen DeVoe, and her family. The Board of Trustees of The Museum of Art"

Among her many projects for the Museum's International Program was the comprehensive survey Modern Art in Prints that was exhibited in 23 cities in Australia, New Zealand, India, Iran, and Japan. She also directed other important traveling exhibitions including Latin American Prints, American Prints 1913-1963, and Modern Artists as Illustrators, which had extensive tours in Latin America, the Far East, and Europe. Riva will be long remembered by her many friends and colleagues throughout the world for her unerring eye, her keen intelligence, and her very sharp wit. We send our deepest sympathies to her family.

(November 13, 1950 August 26, 2014), an acclaimed American cultural historian, photographer and author, and a joyous musician, died in a tragic bicycling accident near his home in Stone Ridge, New York. Born in Pasadena, California, Peter grew up in Guilford, Connecticut. He graduated from Haverford College in 1972. At the University of Texas at Austin, he earned his MA in Photography and American Studies in 1976 and his PhD in American Civilization in 1980 under the mentorships of Garry Winogrand and Dr. William H. Goetzman, respectively. His early academic career led him to the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1980 where he became Professor of Art History, Chair of the Art History Department (2006-2010), and Director of the Study of the U.S. Institute for Scholars (formerly American Studies Institute). He retired in 2010, was named Professor Emeritus, and continued to teach until 2012. Peter and his wife Maureen relocated from Chicago to their home in Stone Ridge, NY in 2012, where he focused on research and writing.

2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,"FIELD--Dr. Michael. Dr. Michael Field, of New York died of an acute illness in the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor on Saturday evening, August 23. He had been taken there earlier in the week from his summer home in Lamoine and comforted during his last days by his wife and sons who were at his side, along with other family members, at the moment of his passing. He was 81. Dr. Field was born in London, England on July 20, 1933 to Hans Hirschfeld, a business man, and Miriam Lewinson, a physician born in Russia. For the first five years of his life he resided in Hamburg Germany from which the family fled on November 8th, 1938, the day before Kristallnacht. They travelled via Rotterdam to the United States, arriving on Thanksgiving. The family ate hot dogs as their first American meal, consumed somewhere on the Upper West Side. This past year, Dr. Field reclaimed his German citizenship to reconnect with his birthright and heritage. Mike, as he was known to his family and acquaintances, obtained his BA from the University of Chicago in 1953 and his MD from Boston University in 1959. He did his residency at Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital, and fulfilled his military service in the United States Public Health Service in Bethesda, MD. In 1964, he joined the Biophysical Laboratory at Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral fellow pursuing research into intracellular mechanisms. It would be his life's work, continuing it as Associate Professor, Harvard Medical School and then as Professor of Medicine and Physiology at the University of Chicago (1977-1984), and Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (1984-2001), where he also served as Director of the Division of Gastroenterology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (1984-1999). He retired as Emeritus Professor of Medicine and Physiology & Cellular Biophysics in 2001. In 1984 Dr. Field was co-recipient of the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine for research into diarrheal disease, in particular cholera. His work demonstrated how cholera and other pathogenic bacteria toxins interfere with the body's salt regulation, a discovery that is now taught to medical students in biochemistry courses throughout the world and which enabled effective diarrheal treatment to be developed for a disease that had killed millions in the developing world. Dr. Field was the first Jewish recipient of the Prize. He was also the author of numerous scholarly papers, editor of a book on diarrheal disease, and the recipient of many honors from his colleagues and peers, including the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Distinguished Achievement Award in 1984, the Lifetime Achievement in Digestive Sciences Award from Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 2000 and the AGA's Distinguished Mentorship Award in 2008. His pleasure in the accomplishments of students and younger colleagues whom he shepherded at critical stages in their careers gave him great satisfaction. In addition to his professional accomplishments and his unwavering devotion to his family, Dr. Field battled devastating illness throughout his life. He was diagnosed with hepatitis in 1961, underwent a portacaval shunt (liver bypass) operation in Atlanta in 1979, received a liver transplant at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in February 1990 and had a kidney transplant at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in 2004 with his wife as donor. His memoir of his life as a physician and patient, which he had substantially completed at the time of his passing, will be edited by his wife. A global community of relatives, colleagues, friends and mentees thought he would live forever, so resolutely did he meet each medical challenge that came his way. He is survived by his wife, Linda Seidel; sons John B.A., Ezra S., and Benjamin H.; their wives Kristen Bearse, Marlene Field, and Viktoriya Torchinsky-Field; grandchildren Helen and Thomas Field; Gabriella, Lillian and Abigail Field; Isaac Torchinsky-Field; brother-in-law Irwin List, niece Allison List Hutner, nephew Steven S. List, and cousins in San Francisco, Israel and South Africa. A memorial is being planned for later in the fall. In his honor, his family asks that you consider registering as an Organ Donor. Donations may be sent to the Center for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center; the Transplant Center at the Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha; and/or the Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, ME."

2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,"BRADLEY--Bill (Wes). Of White Plains, NY, passed away on September 4, 2014 at the age of 91. Beloved husband of Cheryl Bradley and devoted father of Jon, Joelle and Adam, he was known in his community and among his friends as a most caring, honest, and principled man committed to making his part of the world a better place. Bill was born in Brooklyn, NY to Sam and Frieda Bradley on February 22, 1923. He was raised in Brooklyn and attended Bucknell University. At the age of 19, when the United States entered World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines and served as an officer until the end of the war when he returned to Bucknell to finish his education. Upon graduation he met the love of his life, Cheryl Levy, and they were married in August 1947. The newlyweds moved to White Plains where they lived with their two young sons Lance and Jon until 1951 when Bill was again called up by the Marines to serve in the Korean War. Later having served for over 5 ++ years, Bill resigned from the Corps with the rank of Captain. He remained active in Veteran Organizations all throughout his life. Returning to White Plains with his family in 1953. Bill quickly became a civic leader, active in politics and community service. He joined the Democratic Party where he worked to ensure that it held true to the democratic values he believed in all his life. Ultimately, he became Chair of the Democratic Party. As Chairman, in 1969 he was the Democratic mayoral candidate standard bearer when they achieved a victory in their first election in over 50 years seating two Democratic White Plains City Councilmen. He remained actively involved and an advisor to many elected officials until recent years when his health began to decline. Bill dedicated his life to justice, community involvement and equal opportunity. Perhaps no work demonstrates this more clearly than his many years chairing the planning committee of the Brotherhood Breakfast where all faiths and members of the community were invited to come together to share their common values and hopes for the future. Indeed, when Bill Bradley was awarded the Brotherhood Award by his peers in 1966, it was said that the only reason he did not receive it sooner was that he always chaired the committee. Cub Scout Master, founder of a neighborhood Association, Captain of the Community Chest, Vice President of the White Plains lodge of B'nai Brith, and Chairman of the White Plains Anti-Defamation League, were just some of the many ways he was committed to the community in which he lived. Bill and Cheryl were the greatest example of love, devotion and family commitment for over 67 years. Besides his wife, Cheryl, he is survived by his children and grandchildren all of whom are grateful for the example he set for them as a man committed in life to making this world a better place. A memorial service will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 West Broad Street, Mount Vernon, NY on September 8, 2014 at 10am."

2014-09-11T00:00:00Z,"PINTO--Joseph J. Died peacefully on September 9th at his home in South Salem surrounded by people who love him. Born on April 24th, 1933 in Casablanca, Morocco to Jacques M. Pinto and Lunita Toledano Pinto, he was one of the last of the Sephardic Pinto family to be born in Morocco. In September 1939, at age six, he and his family arrived in New York harbor the day Hitler invaded Poland. After several years in Manhattan, the family settled in Greenwich, CT where Joe attended Bruns- wick Academy and then went on to The Lawrenceville School, from which he graduated in 1950. After graduating from Yale University in 1954, he moved back to Casablanca to work for the family tea importing business. Following Morocco's independence in 1956, he returned to New York and soon after met and married Pauline Badham Pinto. They moved to Paris where, with his brother and cousin, he formed Pinto & Cia., a merchant banking business investing in both operating businesses and real estate. In 1963 he moved to Madrid, where his parents resided, and continued his merchant banking activities and made many deep and lasting personal and business relationships. In 1968 he moved to New York to begin his life-long wish to become an American citizen, which he attained in 1980. Over the 1970's he was Instrumental in the formation and development of Sea Containers Ltd, an early entrant in the container leasing industry, and led their capital raising efforts over many years as the Chairman of the Finance Committee and a Board member. After Sea Containers, with one of his lifelong friends from Spain, he formed and led a team directing the investment in a number of private companies in the United States, including Loehmann's, Lehrer McGovern and a handful of other businesses in various industries. To those who knew him personally or in business, Joe was a man of clean reasoning and deep intellect, who was never afraid to ask the simplest of questions, as he was confident, though devoid of ego. He went on to become a private investor and in the early 1990's formed Hinsdale LLC, the Pinto family's investment partnership. Alongside his successful business career, his overriding focus was the care and support of his immediate and extended family. He was thoughtful, kind and dignified cherished by his many friends and family members for his generosity, caring and for his desire to lend support. Complementing his disciplined investing, caring support for his family and his many deep friendships, was his passion for horses, especially eventing and fox-hunting. He was a long time member of the Golden's Bridge Hounds and resident of North Salem, where over many years he and his wife, Linda, enjoyed life at their ""gentleman's farm,"" Salem Sunshine Farm. He is survived by his wife of 31 years, Linda B. Pinto, his two sons and step-son, Paul and John Pinto and Alger B. Chapman, and his four grandchildren, Emma, Sarah, Jacob and Owen. He also leaves behind his older sister, Ena Abensur, his loving cousin and ""little sister,"" Marina Pinto Kaufman, his close cousin, Maurice E. Pinto, his sister-in-law, Camila Pinto, widow of his brother Morris J. Pinto and many cousins, nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly. We will miss him, but know that his presence will live long in our hearts and actions. A service is planned for 10am on Friday, September 12th, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chappell in Manhattan."

Grace was born on March 24, 1927, in New York City, daughter of the late Henry and Evelyn (Timothy) Ross. She married William (Bill) C. Shanley III of Roslyn, NY, in 1954 and recently celebrated their 60th anniversary on May 1st of this year. Grace was the proud mother of six children and 15 grandchildren, as well as an accomplished artist, creative force, and founder of the Center for Contemporary Print Making (CCP). She, along with her husband, Bill, founded the Center in 1995, as a printmaking facility whose mission is to support, preserve, and advance the art of original prints. Grace had a passion for art and a love for people and family. Her infectious creativity, kindness, loyalty, honesty, and joyful laugh will be missed by each person who was privileged to know her. She was an energetic force that touched everyone around her and always saw the best in everything. ""Grandma"" grew up in Jackson Heights, NY where she attended Garden Country Day school and went on to graduate from Manhattanville College with a BS in mathematics. She also studied at the Parsons School of Design, Baltimore Institute and Art Students League. She began her career with the McCann-Erickson advertising agency in NYC before pursuing her creative and artistic passions full time. Moving from Manhasset, NY to New Canaan, CT in 1975, Grace continued her illustrious career in the arts, as an artist, art director and visionary art center founder. For almost 20 years until 1995 she served as the Executive Director of the Silvermine Guild. From 1995 when she founded CCP through her death Grace served as Chairman or Chairman Emeritus of the Board. She also sat on the board of The Shanley Family Foundation, which contributes to education and the arts, and was a Board Member of the Vermont Studio Center. Through her career Grace received awards for her own art, and was written up in the New York Times and numerous other newspapers, art magazines and journals. She was also a member of the Pastel Society of America, and had many exhibits throughout the NY/NE area. Recent shows include, ""Circle of Life Then and Now"", at the Silvermine Art Center in New Canaan CT and ""Recurrence of Memory"" , at the Center for Contemporary Printmaking, in Norwalk, CT. Her talents included oil painting, pastel, charcoal, watercolor, printmaking, and multidiscipline artistry which incorporated photography, computer graphics, and traditional art mediums. She was a highly talented portrait artist, whose subjects where typically her children and grandchildren. Additionally, she was president of the Manhattanville Club, director of the Woman's Club of Nassau/Suffolk, and board member of too many artistic endeavors to count. She was an accomplished tennis player, golfer, and was known to occasionally beat her husband at Skeet Shooting. But in her soul, she was the life force that kept her broad family close. Survivors include her husband of 60 years William C. Shanley III, her children, Sharon S. Sniffen, William C. Shanley IV, Thomas R. Shanley, Mary Evelyn S. Malloy, Timothy K. Shanley and Patrick M. Shanley. Grace was predeceased by a brother Thomas B. Ross. A Funeral Service will take place on September 20, 2014, at 11am at the Church of the Good Shepard in Blooming Grove, PA.

2014-09-14T00:00:00Z,"CREWE--Bob. Known for writing hit songs from the 1950's through the 1970's, including ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You,"" ""Rag Doll,"" ""Walk Like A Man,"" ""Lady Marmalade,"" ""My Eyes Adored You,"" ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore,"" and as the lyricist of the hit Broadway show ""Jersey Boys,"" died peacefully, with his brother Dan Crewe by his side, on Thursday, September 11, 2014 in Scarborough, ME. Crewe was a dynamic, innovative record producer, producing such recording artists as The Four Seasons, Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels, Oliver, Lesley Gore, Frankie Valli and Bobby Darin. He was also mentor to songwriters Kenny Nolan, L. Russell Brown, Desmond Child and Cindy Bullens. Born in Newark, NJ, Bob Crewe spent his formative years in Belleville, NJ. He moved to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design with the desire to become an architect. After a year, Bob left Parsons to embark on a musical career singing on recording demos and writing songs with his first writing partner Frank C. Slay. Together they wrote ""La Dee Dah,"" ""Bells Bells Bells"" and ""Lucky Ladybug"" for Billy & Lillie. Bob's lyrics in the hit song, ""Silhouettes,"" by The Rays, showcased early on his lyrical storytelling. Crewe and Slay also wrote hits for Freddie Cannon including ""Way Down Yonder In New Orleans"" and ""Tallahassee Lassie."" In 1961, Bob Crewe turned to his singing talents on Warwick Records, with ""The Whiffenpoof Song,"" ""Water Boy,"" and ""Voglio Cantare."" Bob's dynamic character and striking good looks triggered teen idol status, landing him on the cover of 16 Magazine and on early 1960's national talent shows. Earlier, he had been a successful fashion model, appearing as the face of Coca-Cola in 1957. During the flurry of music activity in the early Sixties, Bob discovered a young vocal group from New Jersey, hiring them to sing backup on recording demos and singles. With the addition of a young songwriter to the group, Bob Gaudio, Crewe renamed the group The Four Seasons. The songwriting collaboration of Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio garnered many hits for The Four Seasons including ""Rag Doll,"" ""Walk Like A Man,"" ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You,"" ""Big Man In Town"" and ""Bye Bye Baby (Baby Goodbye)."" In 1967, Bob heard a jingle on the radio for a Diet Pepsi commercial and rushed into the studio to record it as a single. ""Music To Watch Girls By"" spawned the Bob Crewe Generation and was a major hit. Bob Crewe innovated the concept of independent record production, creating his own label, DynoVoice Records. The Crewe Group of Companies, a complex of several companies that included three publishing houses, Saturday Music, Tomorrow's Tunes, and Genius Music was formed and administered by his brother Dan Crewe. Bob's musical talent discoveries included an undeniable list of heavyweights. After The Four Seasons, Bob found raw talent in a young band from Detroit and renamed them Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels. The collaboration spawned three Top 10 hits, ""Jenny Take A Ride,"" ""Sock It To Me,"" and ""Devil In A Blue Dress."" Having moved from New York to Los Angeles in the mid 1970's, Bob Crewe's music success continued with young songwriter Kenny Nolan, penning the hit, ""My Eyes Adored You,"" for Frankie Valli's solo effort. In 1974, with continued writing collaboration, Bob and Kenny wrote the Number 1 hit, ""Lady Marmalade,"" which Allen Toussaint recorded with LaBelle. In the 1980's, Bob Crewe renewed his focus on his passion for painting and sculpture. Bob had successful showings at Earl McGrath Gallery, Tom Solomon'S Garage, and Jan Baum Gallery, all in Los Angeles. Nearly every song written by Bob Crewe with his collaborators charted in Billboard's top 20. In 1992, Bob was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He was also feted by BMI in 2000, with a Millennium award for the third most played song on the radio, ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You."" Bob's compositions have been heard in numerous films and television shows and include the score for the soundtrack of the cult classic film Barbarella, written with Charlie Fox. In 2011, Bob and Dan Crewe established the Bob Crewe Foundation. The mission of the Foundation is to support scholarships in the fields of art and music. It also supports LGBTQ issues. The Foundation recently granted the Maine College of Art $3 million to establish the Bob Crewe Program for Art and Music. The program introduces, for the first time, a music program at a college of Art. Bob Crewe is survived by his brother, Dan Crewe of Cumberland, ME; niece Reid Bullens Crewe of Portland, ME, and Cidny Bullens of Portland, ME. He is also survived by niece Therese Crewe of Newton, NJ, nephew Thomas C. Crewe of Hewitt, NJ, and many close friends and colleagues. Bob was very proud of his sobriety as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 37 years. Bob will be missed, but not forgotten - every twenty minutes a Bob Crewe song is playing somewhere in the world. Donations can be made in Bob's name to the Maine College of Art Scholarship Fund, the University of Southern Maine School of Music Scholarship Fund, or The Frannie Peabody Center, Portland, ME.

It is with great sadness that we share the news that Dan Mindich, extraordinary husband and father, beloved son, brother and friend, died of a presumed cardiac event on September 1 while swimming in an open water race near his home in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dan graduated from Vassar College, where he met the love of his life, the amazing Shilpa Patel. After spending a year teaching in rural Kenya, Dan graduated from Stanford's STEP program with a master's in education. He went on to teach in northern California, Vermont and finally at the Punahou School, in Honolulu where he taught English and History. He returned to Stanford to earn a doctorate in educational policy before rejoining the Punahou faculty in 2011 where, in addition to teaching, he served as the director of its Academy Summer School. Dan was a remarkable teacher, known for his humor, energy and ability to inspire excellence in his students. He had a huge heart, which had room for so many people and he was loved by so many. He loved to eat, tell stories and to laugh until he cried. Dan is survived by Shilpa and their three children, Satya, Asha and Vida; his parents, Leonard and Margot Zucker Mindich; his brothers, David and Jeremy; his sister-in law, Amy Smith; the Patel family; his extended family and friends. We need to continue to tell Daniel stories, remember his irrepressible joy, perform random acts of kindness as he did and remember his love and pass it on. A memorial service will be held later in the year. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Punahou School for the Daniel Mindich Endowed Financial Aid Fund. 1601 Punahou Street Honolulu, HI 96822."

2014-09-15T00:00:00Z,"JAFFE--Jeff H. Jeff H. Jaffe, Chairman and President of The Chunky Corporation and President and CEO of Ward Foods Candy, Ward Foods Branded Foods Group, Schrafft Candy Company and Bernan Foods, died of natural causes at his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida on July 27, 2014. He was 93 years old. In 1950, Mr. Jaffe leveraged the purchase of a small bankrupt candy company in Brooklyn known for a chocolate bar called CHUNKY. Due to his marketing skills and ability to take risks and win, he built Chunky into a major player in the candy industry. Through the years, Mr. Jaffe acquired other candy companies. In 1951, he reached an agreement with Rowntree & Company of York, England to import Kit Kat, the famous chocolate covered sugar wafer candy bar, and shortly nationwide distribution was successfully achieved. Shutter Candy Company, manufacturer of Bit-O-Honey and Old Nick, was purchased in 1958, and Klotz Confection Company in 1960. In 1965, he bought Chocolate Sponge from Heide Candy Company and produced it in the Shutter plant in Chicago. He added Oh Henry!, purchased from the Williams Candy Company, to Shutter in 1971. Jeff Jaffe, well respected by the candy industry, received two prestigious awards among many. The Association of Manufacturers of Candy and Chocolate presented their award to him at a testimonial dinner attended by over 400 industry members in 1964. He was the youngest executive, at age forty-four, to be honored in this fashion. In 1971 he received the 26th Kettle Award and was named ""Candy Man of the Year"" by Candy Industry Magazine, who recognized him for his ""endless efforts on behalf of his industry and his community..."" Two noteworthy accomplishments were the Chunky exhibit at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair and the Harvard Business School case study on Chunky. The World's Fair exhibit, an actual manufacturing plant, automatically coated with chocolate, wrapped and packaged Old Nick candy bars. It also contained the ""Sculpture Continuum"" that served as an art form and a functional children's playground and an area where company products were sold. The cost per thousand was many times less than that of companies like IBM and GM. It was proclaimed that the Chunky exhibit ""could not help but benefit the entire candy industry."" Harvard Business School's Midway Series was used by nearly 1,000 MBA participants in the Executive Education Programs each year. A landmark in case writing, the study was used by more than fifty universities at home and abroad and dozens of Fortune 50 companies. For sixteen years, Mr. Jaffe lectured on the study to hundreds of HBS students and in 1977 was ceremoniously honored ""for his important service to Harvard Business School."" Mr. Jaffe served on many Boards (including Young Presidents' Organization) and contributed to various communities throughout his life. In later years, he was President of Sailfish Point of Stuart, Florida and helped transfer ownership from the developer, Mobil Oil, to the residents. In 2001, he brought Sir John Templeton's ""Laws of Life"" essay contest to Martin County, Florida. Reaching students of all backgrounds, the contest inspired them to focus on their principles and ideals. Mr. Jaffe, himself, valued integrity above all. Jeff Jaffe was born Irwin Hugh Jaffe on December 25, 1920 in Washington, DC. Nicknamed ""Jeff"" at Virginia Polytechnic Institute where he received a degree in Architectural Engineering, he legally changed his name shortly after 2001. Unhappy as an architectural engineer, he left his family painting and construction business and moved to Manhattan in April, 1945. There he met his wife, Natalie, on a blind date. They were married six months later. Jeff Jaffe is survived by Natalie, his wife of 68 years, his two daughters Bonnie Berens and Holly Jaffe, four grandsons and three great-grandsons. They all said, ""Make it flat. You'll never get a nickel for that funny-looking, not-quite-square, truncated something or other. Make it flat like a Hershey bar. Then you'll have something to sell."" He took that chunk of chocolate and made history. As he entitled his book, ""How Sweet It Is."" A Memorial Service will be held on Tuesday, September 30, 2014 at 5:00pm at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60th Street, New York, NY 10022."

2014-09-16T00:00:00Z,"THOMSON--John B. Jr. Former Owner/Chairman of Thomson Industries & Pillar of the sailing community passes away at 70. The sailing community lost one of its best owner/drivers and a pillar of the sport when John B. Thomson, Jr., of Sands Point, NY, passed away in the evening of Wednesday, September 10, surrounded by family and loved ones after succumbing to the effects of ALS. Thomson Jr. was a beloved figure in his hometown and around the world. Husband to wife Adrienne, father to three children and grandfather to more, he was also the steady and kindhearted owner of the Infinity yacht racing team, which won many regattas around the world through the course of 40 years of buoy and ocean racing, spanning from the early 1970s into the 21st century. Mr. Thomson was born May 31, 1944, in Mineola, NY, the son of Louise Magoon Thomson and John B. Thomson, Sr. He attended the New York Institute of Technology where he earned an engineering degree. Upon graduation, he joined Thomson Industries, the company founded by his father, who, in the early 1940's, invented the linear motion ball bushing bearing. Thomson Jr. rose to become chief executive officer and chairman of the company, and contributed many patents to the company's line of proprietary technology. Aviation was always a cornerstone of the Thomson family, starting with Thomson Sr.'s invention of the linear bushing bearing, which gave birth to the first variable pitch propeller. This tradition continued with Thomson Jr. becoming a skilled pilot, who flew his helicopters. His ability as a pilot is a key legacy of his business and personal life. Thomson Jr. also had great effect in the sailing community. He began sailing at the age of eight and later in life would go on to own a series of yachts named Infinity. His welcoming nature and hearty laugh were readily recognized at the many regattas he won, including the Kenwood Cup, SORC, Block Island Race Week, Key West Race Week, Antigua Race Week, and the Around Long Island Race. Thomson was a member of the New York Yacht Club, Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Royal Cork Yacht Club, and the Storm Trysail Club, for which he served as commodore. He was past director of the U.S. Naval Academy-Fales Committee, and one of the benefactors that helped the New York Yacht Club purchase its satellite clubhouse in Newport, RI. He also was very active in owners' associations for classes such as the International 50-Foot Association and the Farr 40 Class Association, and also enjoyed a skeet membership at the Sands Point Golf Club. Thomson founded one of Long Island Sound's greatest regattas, the Manhasset Bay Fall Series. Founded in 1979, the regatta is a premier event on the East Coast and used by crews as a final tune-up before heading to the winter racing season in Florida. The overall trophy is named in honor of his father, John B. Thomson, Sr. With his wife and family at his side, Thomson always steered his yachts and believed in an amateur crew, which often included lifelong friends. In his honor, the New York Yacht Club and Storm Trysail Club together formed the John B. Thomson Award for Campaign Excellence. Thomson Jr. was a staunch supporter of his community. He was a Trustee at the North-Shore-LIJ Health System in Manhasset, NY, and served for many years as a Trustee at the South Street Seaport Museum, in New York City. Through his family's charitable foundation, Thomson Jr. supported many local fundraising efforts, always choosing to keep his charitable giving ""close to home."" Thomson is survived by his wife Adrienne Thomson, of Sands Point, NY, children John B. Thomson, III, of Sands Point, NY, Victoria Thomson, of Sands Point, NY, Scott Thomson, of New York, NY, and three grandchildren. A tribute and celebration of John's life will be held on Friday, September 26th, at Manhasset Bay Yacht Club in Port Washington, New York, from 3-8 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in John's honor be sent to The ALS Association Greater New York Chapter, 42 Broadway, Suite 1724, New York, NY 10004, or online: www.als.org."

It is with great sadness that we share the news that Dan Mindich, extraordinary husband and father, beloved son, brother and friend, died of a presumed cardiac event on September 1 while swimming in an open water race near his home in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dan graduated from Vassar College, where he met the love of his life, the amazing Shilpa Patel. After spending a year teaching in rural Kenya, Dan graduated from Stanford's STEP program with a master's in education. He went on to teach in northern California, Vermont and finally at the Punahou School, in Honolulu where he taught English and History. He returned to Stanford to earn a doctorate in educational policy before rejoining the Punahou faculty in 2011 where, in addition to teaching, he served as the director of its Academy Summer School. Dan was a remarkable teacher, known for his humor, energy and ability to inspire excellence in his students. He had a huge heart, which had room for so many people and he was loved by so many. He loved to eat, tell stories and to laugh until he cried. Dan is survived by Shilpa and their three children, Satya, Asha and Vida; his parents, Leonard and Margot Zucker Mindich; his brothers, David and Jeremy; his sister-in law, Amy Smith; the Patel family; his extended family and friends. We need to continue to tell Daniel stories, remember his irrepressible joy, perform random acts of kindness as he did and remember his love and pass it on. A memorial service will be held later in the year. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Punahou School for the Daniel Mindich Endowed Financial Aid Fund. 1601 Punahou Street Honolulu, HI 96822."

2014-09-16T00:00:00Z,"CREWE--Bob. Bob, you were always one of those ""there's no one quite like you"" kind of guys. There were plenty of talented people in the music business of the 60's and the 70's and in the visual arts and just about everything you touched and did was artistic. You not only had a golden ear; you had a golden eye. I remember my first tour of the Crewe Triplex Penthouse on Fifth Avenue which jutted out as if it were part of Central Park. You were so proud of the fact that you had outbid Walt Disney for exotic wood panelings inside which came from the Indonesian Pavilion of the World's Fair of the 60's. I had never seen a real fur spread thrown over a Hollywood King-sized bed. I had never been to an apartment with its own full gymnasium. I had never known anyone in real life to look like a movie star or live like one. You were outre, outrageous and sui generis. Your work ethic was not by the book. You worked by gut. I don't think you had any musical training of significance but you knew what you liked and were relentless with fortitude and resilience. You kept pushing forward and set an example for a new definition of talent. It takes more than ""talent"". You demonstrated how to kick doors open, to stick your foot in a door that's being slammed and change your persona to make yourself so seductive that no one could say ""no"" to Bob Crewe. I recall your convincing me to meet your astrologer, Augusta Willy, who lived on Bank Street in the Village for astrological clearance and a transaction involving a singer who went by the name of Eddie Jason and whose real name was Edward Germano, later a mogul of recording studios, the most elegant recording studios, the ""money is no object"" studios and things he learned from you. Apparently, my moon was in the right position to proceed and I was given ""clearance"" by Mrs. Willy. I told you that I found the experience disconcerting. You laughed. When I told you I needed the agreed advance paid to my client (Eddie) in single dollar bills because he wanted to surprise his wife and roll on the bed with tens and tens of thousands of dollars of money which was his advance against royalties, you found it delightfully refreshing, romantic and laughed again. The only thing close to a goodbye we had was when brother Dan confirmed your fall a few years ago. I wrote you a long letter of Proustian memories of times gone by and recollections of the good ole days. I then spoke with Dan and he told me that for a few hours, you were able to relive and remember all of that world of Camelot when you were king. Bob, trust me when I say ""oh pretty baby"" because you were the best looking of them all and you were ""just too good to be true"" and I thank God you were alive and you always will be alive in my memories and in the songs you wrote. You'll be right at home with all of the angels, Bob, because stars belong in Heaven. You'll still shine and sparkle very brightly with your flawless nose/jaw/chiseled angelic face. Freddie & Myrna Gershon (with smiles and tears)"

2014-09-17T00:00:00Z,"CREWE--Bob. Bob, you were always one of those ""there's no one quite like you"" kind of guys. There were plenty of talented people in the music business of the 60's and the 70's and in the visual arts and just about everything you touched and did was artistic. You not only had a golden ear; you had a golden eye. I remember my first tour of the Crewe Triplex Penthouse on Fifth Avenue which jutted out as if it were part of Central Park. You were so proud of the fact that you had outbid Walt Disney for exotic wood panelings inside which came from the Indonesian Pavilion of the World's Fair of the 60's. I had never seen a real fur spread thrown over a Hollywood King-sized bed. I had never been to an apartment with its own full gymnasium. I had never known anyone in real life to look like a movie star or live like one. You were outre, outrageous and sui generis. Your work ethic was not by the book. You worked by gut. I don't think you had any musical training of significance but you knew what you liked and were relentless with fortitude and resilience. You kept pushing forward and set an example for a new definition of talent. It takes more than ""talent"". You demonstrated how to kick doors open, to stick your foot in a door that's being slammed and change your persona to make yourself so seductive that no one could say ""no"" to Bob Crewe. I recall your convincing me to meet your astrologer, Augusta Willy, who lived on Bank Street in the Village for astrological clearance and a transaction involving a singer who went by the name of Eddie Jason and whose real name was Edward Germano, later a mogul of recording studios, the most elegant recording studios, the ""money is no object"" studios and things he learned from you. Apparently, my moon was in the right position to proceed and I was given ""clearance"" by Mrs. Willy. I told you that I found the experience disconcerting. You laughed. When I told you I needed the agreed advance paid to my client (Eddie) in single dollar bills because he wanted to surprise his wife and roll on the bed with tens and tens of thousands of dollars of money which was his advance against royalties, you found it delightfully refreshing, romantic and laughed again. The only thing close to a goodbye we had was when brother Dan confirmed your fall a few years ago. I wrote you a long letter of Proustian memories of times gone by and recollections of the good ole days. I then spoke with Dan and he told me that for a few hours, you were able to relive and remember all of that world of Camelot when you were king. Bob, trust me when I say ""oh pretty baby"" because you were the best looking of them all and you were ""just too good to be true"" and I thank God you were alive and you always will be alive in my memories and in the songs you wrote. You'll be right at home with all of the angels, Bob, because stars belong in Heaven. You'll still shine and sparkle very brightly with your flawless nose/jaw/chiseled angelic face. Freddie & Myrna Gershon (with smiles and tears)"

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"KRIM--Arthur B. April 4, 1910 - September 21, 1994 Arthur B. Krim passed away twenty years ago today. We, his family, mark this day by commemorating him and celebrating his life well-lived. He was born in his paternal grandfather's house in Harlem, NY, the son of two young Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father, Morris Krim, had immigrated to the United States at the age of 15, from the Ukrainian shtetl of Borispol, first supporting himself with a fruit and vegetable stand on a street corner in New York City's Lower East Side. His mother was Rose Ocko, a seamstress. She too had emigrated from Russia as a teen. Growing up first in New York City, then in Lakewood, NJ and Mount Vernon, NY, he received his first catcher's mitt from his father when he was eight years old, beginning a life-long love of baseball. With a bugle he received from his uncle, he played reveille each morning at summer camp and later the trumpet in high school, and in his college band. With a deep love of reading and learning, he thrived at Columbia College, immersing himself and excelling in his studies of philosophy, history, and English literature and where he was captain of the debating team. He attended Columbia Law School where he became Editor-in-Chief of the Law Review and from which he graduated first in his class. During WWII, he served for three years as a U.S. Army attorney in the Pacific. As special assistant to the Undersecretary of War, he earned the praises of his superiors for providing effective assistance to business and industry working to increase military aircraft and equipment production and resolving critical manpower issues. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In his early legal career in New York City, he joined the law firm of Phillips & Nizer and represented many theater artists and writers. He spent time with members of New York's Group Theater and this period became the harbinger of his empathy for and understanding of, the creative community. Within a few years of such involvement and representation, he and his law partner Robert Benjamin were transferred ownership of a troubled United Artists and led it from near bankruptcy to profitability, followed by many years of success. As chief executive of United Artists, he and his team developed and adopted the innovative and successful practice of financing the films of independent producers, directors, actors, and writers, some of whom had been blacklisted in the McCarthy era, while providing them with unprecedented levels of creative autonomy. He became known for investing in the unique and little known producer, director or writer who did not, or could not, fit the Hollywood mold, but who had an important story to tell. At Orion Pictures, he and his team continued the same successful approach. Ultimately, he was the force and direction behind the financing and distribution of more than 1,000 films over a 40-year period. Many of his films earned Academy Award recognition. Fourteen received Academy Awards in the ""Best Picture"" category, the most of any studio head in the film industry. He was deeply committed to numerous humanitarian causes, most notably, the struggles for civil rights, civil liberties, and against apartheid in Zimbabwe and South Africa; efforts toward improved international relations and for nuclear disarmament; and the struggle for gay rights. He served on the Board of Governors of Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science; the Board of Trustees of his beloved Columbia University, including five years as its chairman; as a Life Trustee of the African-American Institute; and on the Boards of the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson Library Foundations. Having lived through the Depression and the Jim Crow era and believing that a civilized, compassionate society had a moral responsibility to provide education, economic opportunity, and protection to the weak, the economically disadvantaged, and those against whom it had discriminated, he devoted decades of personal service and financial support to the Democratic Party. And, he proudly yet privately served as trusted personal advisor to three Presidents: John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Along with the considerable achievements and contributions of his lifetime, from which so many have benefited and will continue to benefit, he was a modest, self-effacing man of the highest integrity, of impeccable honesty, an exceedingly generous and loyal friend, a role model to every member of our family and of our extended family, and a loving, patient, accepting, and supportive husband, father, and grandfather. Today, as always, we remember him with much gratitude and love. Mathilde Krim, Daphna Krim & Sergio Kapfer, Amanda Crotty, Robert & Mayra Crotty, Maria Jonzier, and Marc & Renee Jonzier."

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"WELLIN--Keith S. Noted Charleston philanthropist and retired Wall Street executive Keith S. Wellin died Sunday at age 88 following a long illness, surrounded by his beloved wife Wendy, loving family and friends. Wellin was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan on August 13, 1926 and was raised in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, he attended the Citadel and was stationed as an officer in Seoul, Korea. Following his Army service, Mr. Wellin returned to Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he received a degree in Philosophy and English literature, then went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1952. During his career on Wall Street, Wellin served as president and vice chairman of E.F. Hutton, president of Reynolds Securities, and then chairman of DW Intercapital and vice chairman of Dean Witter Reynolds. He also served as chairman of Moorco International, Inc., a Houston-based energy equipment company. Always remembering those less fortunate, Keith was particularly generous to those in need. From his early days, he was a significant supporter of the Bowery Mission in New York City. In memory of his niece Ruth, who was killed in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he supported a space dedicated to women in need at the Bowery. Wellin served as a life trustee of Hamilton College, where he was first elected to the board in 1969 and served as chairman of the college's Investment Committee. Together with his wife Wendy, Mr. Wellin was a significant benefactor of Hamilton, supporting special endowment projects and making transformative gifts to create spaces named in their honor for music, athletics and the sciences. In 2007, the Wellins made the single largest gift in the history of Hamilton College. Their $10 million lead gift to the arts funded the Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum named in memory of his parents, which was dedicated in 2012. The Wellins' great love for Hamilton and Charleston is reflected in joint exhibitions which have since been co-curated with the Wellin and Halsey Museums. The Wellins returned to Charleston in 2005, where they quickly became engaged citizens and have been actively involved in local philanthropic efforts. In addition to supporting generously many local organizations, the Wellins have made significant gifts to the Medical University of South Carolina and to the Roper St. Francis Hospital. In recognition of their support, construction will begin in November on the Wendy and Keith Wellin Head and Neck Clinic at MUSC and plans are underway for construction of the Wellin Stroke Center at Roper St. Francis. In lieu of flowers, please consider gifts in Keith's memory to the Wendy and Keith Wellin Head and Neck Clinic MSC550 (135 Rutledge Avenue, Charleston, SC 29425) or to the Roper St. Francis Foundation/Wellin Stroke Center (125 Doughty Street, Suite 790, Charleston, SC 29403).

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"THOMSON--John B. Jr. Former Owner/Chairman of Thomson Industries & Pillar of the sailing community passes away at 70. The sailing community lost one of its best owner/drivers and a pillar of the sport when John B. Thomson, Jr., of Sands Point, NY, passed away in the evening of Wednesday, September 10, surrounded by family and loved ones after succumbing to the effects of ALS. Thomson Jr. was a beloved figure in his hometown and around the world. Husband to wife Adrienne, father to three children and grandfather to more, he was also the steady and kindhearted owner of the Infinity yacht racing team, which won many regattas around the world through the course of 40 years of buoy and ocean racing, spanning from the early 1970s into the 21st century. Mr. Thomson was born May 31, 1944, in Mineola, NY, the son of Louise Magoon Thomson and John B. Thomson, Sr. He attended the New York Institute of Technology where he earned an engineering degree. Upon graduation, he joined Thomson Industries, the company founded by his father, who, in the early 1940's, invented the linear motion ball bushing bearing. Thomson Jr. rose to become chief executive officer and chairman of the company, and contributed many patents to the company's line of proprietary technology. Aviation was always a cornerstone of the Thomson family, starting with Thomson Sr.'s invention of the linear bushing bearing, which gave birth to the first variable pitch propeller. This tradition continued with Thomson Jr. becoming a skilled pilot, who flew his helicopters. His ability as a pilot is a key legacy of his business and personal life. Thomson Jr. also had great effect in the sailing community. He began sailing at the age of eight and later in life would go on to own a series of yachts named Infinity. His welcoming nature and hearty laugh were readily recognized at the many regattas he won, including the Kenwood Cup, SORC, Block Island Race Week, Key West Race Week, Antigua Race Week, and the Around Long Island Race. Thomson was a member of the New York Yacht Club, Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, Royal Cork Yacht Club, and the Storm Trysail Club, for which he served as commodore. He was past director of the U.S. Naval Academy-Fales Committee, and one of the benefactors that helped the New York Yacht Club purchase its satellite clubhouse in Newport, RI. He also was very active in owners' associations for classes such as the International 50-Foot Association and the Farr 40 Class Association, and also enjoyed a skeet membership at the Sands Point Golf Club. Thomson founded one of Long Island Sound's greatest regattas, the Manhasset Bay Fall Series. Founded in 1979, the regatta is a premier event on the East Coast and used by crews as a final tune-up before heading to the winter racing season in Florida. The overall trophy is named in honor of his father, John B. Thomson, Sr. With his wife and family at his side, Thomson always steered his yachts and believed in an amateur crew, which often included lifelong friends. In his honor, the New York Yacht Club and Storm Trysail Club together formed the John B. Thomson Award for Campaign Excellence. Thomson Jr. was a staunch supporter of his community. He was a Trustee at the North-Shore-LIJ Health System in Manhasset, NY, and served for many years as a Trustee at the South Street Seaport Museum, in New York City. Through his family's charitable foundation, Thomson Jr. supported many local fundraising efforts, always choosing to keep his charitable giving ""close to home.""

Characterized throughout her life by integrity, courage, and luminous intelligence, Kate dedicated her formidable capacities to caring for others: for her mother, Emma Aronson, and young sister, Ruth, through the Depression, for her husband, Dr. George L. Nicklin through 56 years of marriage until his death in 2007, for her beloved children and grandchildren, who were the light of her life, for young children and struggling families in her professional life as a social worker, and for her friends and those with whom she partnered as a joyful volunteer in the serious work of Quaker organizations. Kate's special gifts for spiritual leadership and clear vision were recognized in the community of Friends (Quakers), and she was tapped to serve first as Clerk of Westbury Meeting and then Clerk of New York Yearly Meeting, from 1974-77. Kate also served the American Friends Service Committee for many years, during two terms as the Clerk of the New York Metropolitan Regional Office, as a member of the Board from 1979-2001 and leader in the work of its committees, and as the Treasurer of AFSC from 1994-2000. Next to her devotion to her family and children, her commitment to Friends, and especially to AFSC, was central to her life's work and allowed her talents to bloom and inspire many others. She was extraordinarily gifted as a clerk who could find the sense of a meeting and lead a group of Friends through contentious waters to a shared vision. Her loss is keenly felt by her dearly loved children, Emily Nicklin, David Nicklin (Amy Kietzman), Jane Nicklin Olsen (Bob Olsen), and Sarah Nicklin (Jim Moreno), her cherished grandchildren, Max Schleusener (Meg Hammond), Luke, and Anna Schleusener, Kate, Megan, and Sarafina Kietzman-Nicklin, Emma and Elizabeth Olsen, Molly Olsen Lewen (Mike Lewen), and Graham, Clara, and Olivia Moreno, her dear brother-in-law, Jerry Berner, and beloved nieces and nephew and grand niece and grand nephews.

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"JAFFE--Jeff H. Jeff H. Jaffe, Chairman and President of The Chunky Corporation and President and CEO of Ward Foods Candy, Ward Foods Branded Foods Group, Schrafft Candy Company and Bernan Foods, died of natural causes at his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida on July 27, 2014. He was 93 years old. In 1950, Mr. Jaffe leveraged the purchase of a small bankrupt candy company in Brooklyn known for a chocolate bar called CHUNKY. Due to his marketing skills and ability to take risks and win, he built Chunky into a major player in the candy industry. Through the years, Mr. Jaffe acquired other candy companies. In 1951, he reached an agreement with Rowntree & Company of York, England to import Kit Kat, the famous chocolate covered sugar wafer candy bar, and shortly nationwide distribution was successfully achieved. Shutter Candy Company, manufacturer of Bit-O-Honey and Old Nick, was purchased in 1958, and Klotz Confection Company in 1960. In 1965, he bought Chocolate Sponge from Heide Candy Company and produced it in the Shutter plant in Chicago. He added Oh Henry!, purchased from the Williams Candy Company, to Shutter in 1971. Jeff Jaffe, well respected by the candy industry, received two prestigious awards among many. The Association of Manufacturers of Candy and Chocolate presented their award to him at a testimonial dinner attended by over 400 industry members in 1964. He was the youngest executive, at age forty-four, to be honored in this fashion. In 1971 he received the 26th Kettle Award and was named ""Candy Man of the Year"" by Candy Industry Magazine, who recognized him for his ""endless efforts on behalf of his industry and his community..."" Two noteworthy accomplishments were the Chunky exhibit at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair and the Harvard Business School case study on Chunky. The World's Fair exhibit, an actual manufacturing plant, automatically coated with chocolate, wrapped and packaged Old Nick candy bars. It also contained the ""Sculpture Continuum"" that served as an art form and a functional children's playground and an area where company products were sold. The cost per thousand was many times less than that of companies like IBM and GM. It was proclaimed that the Chunky exhibit ""could not help but benefit the entire candy industry."" Harvard Business School's Midway Series was used by nearly 1,000 MBA participants in the Executive Education Programs each year. A landmark in case writing, the study was used by more than fifty universities at home and abroad and dozens of Fortune 50 companies. For sixteen years, Mr. Jaffe lectured on the study to hundreds of HBS students and in 1977 was ceremoniously honored ""for his important service to Harvard Business School."" Mr. Jaffe served on many Boards (including Young Presidents' Organization) and contributed to various communities throughout his life. In later years, he was President of Sailfish Point of Stuart, Florida and helped transfer ownership from the developer, Mobil Oil, to the residents. In 2001, he brought Sir John Templeton's ""Laws of Life"" essay contest to Martin County, Florida. Reaching students of all backgrounds, the contest inspired them to focus on their principles and ideals. Mr. Jaffe, himself, valued integrity above all. Jeff Jaffe was born Irwin Hugh Jaffe on December 25, 1920 in Washington, DC. Nicknamed ""Jeff"" at Virginia Polytechnic Institute where he received a degree in Architectural Engineering, he legally changed his name shortly after 2001. Unhappy as an architectural engineer, he left his family painting and construction business and moved to Manhattan in April, 1945. There he met his wife, Natalie, on a blind date. They were married six months later. Jeff Jaffe is survived by Natalie, his wife of 68 years, his two daughters Bonnie Berens and Holly Jaffe, four grandsons and three great-grandsons. They all said, ""Make it flat. You'll never get a nickel for that funny-looking, not-quite-square, truncated something or other. Make it flat like a Hershey bar. Then you'll have something to sell."" He took that chunk of chocolate and made history. As he entitled his book, ""How Sweet It Is."" A Memorial Service will be held on Tuesday, September 30, 2014 at 5:00pm at the Harmonie Club, 4 East 60th Street, New York, NY 10022."

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"HAURY--Agnese Nelms passed away on March 20, 2014, in Tucson, AZ, at the age of 90. Born in Houston, Texas, on May 17, 1923, she is preceded in death by her husband, twin sister, and brother. Survivors include a niece and nephews. Early in her life, Mrs. Haury acquired an interest in helping individuals struggling with language barriers to receive justice in the courtroom. She also assisted organizations and individuals working to effect social change by providing funding to expand influential ideas and programs. Mrs. Haury was educated at the College de Jeunes Filles in Fontainebleau, France, and at Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn. She received a B.A. degree in history from Bryn Mawr College in 1946. She was married to Manice deForest Lockwood III (1950-1976), Denver Lindley (1978-1982) and Emil W. Haury (1990-1992); all predeceased her. Mrs. Haury's professional career included work as an editor at the United Nations. While employed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, she traveled to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Libya, and Burma making surveys and writing treatises on economic and social problems in those countries as well as economic development possibilities. In 1964-1965 she processed and catalogued artifacts recovered from the Snaketown Archaeological Project in central Arizona, which was directed by Emil W. Haury. Through her work at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Mrs. Haury formed a lifelong friendship with its president, Alger Hiss. Over a 60-year period, Mrs. Haury supported a series of activities aimed at clearing Mr. Hiss of charges leveled against him by Whittaker Chambers and Richard Nixon. In honor of Mr. Hiss, she established the Alger Hiss Distinguished Professorship at Bard College and provided financial support for the Emergency Civil Liberties Foundation and The Nation Institute. She also provided funding to individuals engaged in legal research and writing about Mr. Hiss and supported the National Security Archive, an independent nonprofit repository of declassified U.S. government documents. She also helped establish New York University's Center for the United States and the Cold War as well as the Alger Hiss Papers Project at NYU's Tamiment Library. Personal friends of Mrs. Haury speak of her intelligence and unpretentious nature. She rarely spent money on herself except to fill her home with beloved collections of Native American rugs, pottery, and artwork. Her true enthusiasm was always for people, and her philanthropy extended from the preservation of cultural artifacts to support of human rights for both immigrant and Native American populations. From 1981-1990 Mrs. Haury was president of the Agnese N. Lindley Foundation, which funded projects concerning social and humanitarian problems, civil and human rights issues, the arts, the environment, and scientific research. The foundation also supported journalism, civic affairs, and economic advancement in less-developed countries. More than 200 projects received funding through the foundation including the following: preservation of more than 100,000 photographs of the conflict in El Salvador, the start-up of an Inter-American Environmental Policy Center, a project to help increase the number of Indian groups gaining federal tribal recognition, and research on the rapidly disappearing Native American languages of Yaqui and Samish. The foundation also provided grants for archaeological excavations; scholarships in the fields of art conservation; and an intern program for The Nation magazine, which provided young journalists an opportunity to learn about political and social reporting. With her support, the University of Arizona established the Agnese N. Haury Institute of Court Interpretation (a certification program for teachers across the country who train court interpreters). Mrs. Haury also supported endowments for anthropology graduate students; dendrochronological research; the construction of the Agnese and Emil Haury Southwest Native Nations Pottery Vault; and the Bryant Bannister Tree-Ring Building, which houses the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research and its irreplaceable collection of tree-ring specimens from around the world. The University of Arizona gave Mrs. Haury an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1999 and a Citizen of the Year Award in 2001. In 2007 the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society gave her the Victor R. Stoner Award. In keeping with Mrs. Haury's lifelong use of her financial resources to support scholarly work and advance human rights on an international scale, her love of the Arizona-Sonoran desert region and its peoples, and her desire to address serious issues in a meaningful way, her estate will provide more than $50 million to the University of Arizona Foundation to create the Agnese Nelms Haury Program in Environment and Social Justice at the University of Arizona and will fund other programs consistent with her philanthropic objectives."

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"GLAUBINGER--Lawrence D. Beloved husband of Lucienne Glaubinger, died of natural causes on September 16 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88. A respected entrepreneur and philanthropist, Larry was chief executive for several textile companies throughout his 40-year career, most recently of Stern and Stern Industries, from which he retired. Larry served in the Coast Guard, stationed in the South Pacific, in the final days of World War II. Benefitting from the GI Bill, Larry graduated from Indiana University in 1949, and later attended Columbia Business School during a hiatus from executive duties, graduating in 1977. Forever grateful for the opportunity to further his own education, he supported hundreds of student scholarships at both alma maters--including the establishment of an endowment in his name for student athletes in non-revenue-generating sports at IU. He stayed in touch with many scholarship recipients for decades, gratified to learn about the careers in education, business, law and medicine he had helped to launch. A private funeral service was held on September 18 at Beth David Cemetery in Kenilworth , New Jersey. The family suggests that in lieu of flowers a gift in remembrance of Lawrence Glaubinger to benefit student athlete scholarships in the Glaubinger Endowment Fund be sent to: IU Foundation, P.O.

2014-09-21T00:00:00Z,"COTTER--James J. On September 13, 2014, James Joseph Cotter, 76, passed away after a heroic battle with prostate cancer surrounded by his loving family. He was born on February 10, 1938 in the Bronx section of New York City to James Joseph and Marie Wynne Cotter. In 1955, he graduated from New York City's Xavier High School, and then attended Georgetown University and Georgetown University Law Center. After graduation, he studied tax law at New York University. Mr. Cotter was a prominent and innovative businessman and known as one of the early activist shareholders. He was the driving force behind the often sited Technicolor decision in Delaware, a case that set out many of the standards for director conduct. He backed the management of Stater Bros. Markets, a California supermarket chain, in an early leveraged buy-out that lead to his ownership of half that company. He was instrumental in saving what was then known as the Fidelity Federal Bank. In the early 1980s, Mr. Cotter gained control of the company that owned the Reading Railroad of Monopoly gameboard fame and one of the oldest companies in America, which traced its roots back to the mid-1830s. Over the next thirty years, as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Reading International, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDI), Mr. Cotter oversaw the Company's growth to become one the world's leading theatrical exhibition companies and growing real estate company, with cinema, live theater and real estate assets in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. The Angelika Film Centers, the Union Square Theater building in New York City and Reading Cinemas in Australia and New Zealand (one of the largest exhibitors in each of those countries) are among the assets now controlled by Reading. Mr. Cotter started his involvement in the movie exhibition and real estate industries in 1969 when he worked for William Forman, the founder of Pacific Theaters, which, at the time, was a chain of drive-in movie theaters. Mr. Cotter continued to work for Pacific, its affiliates and the Forman family for over 40 years Mr. Cotter became a personal investor in California agricultural businesses in the 1970s. He owned Cecelia Packing Corporation and formed JJ Cotter Orchards. Mr. Cotter's agricultural business currently controls approximately 2,000 acres of orange groves in the San Joaquin Valley. Cecelia Packing Corporation is considered amongst the finest citrus companies in the industry. Outside of his love for business, Jim was an avid handball player, which he began playing at age 23. Shortly before his passing, Jim continued to play handball several times per week. Much of his life revolved around his handball games played at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, New York Athletic Club and University Athletic Club, at each of which he was a devoted member. Jim is survived by Mary Ellen Cotter and their three children, Ellen Marie Cotter, Ann Margaret Cotter and James Joseph Cotter, their five grandchildren, Duffy, Margot, Sophia, Brooke, James, his brother, Gerard W. Cotter, and his daughter-in-law, Gina Taylor. A Memorial Mass Celebration will be held at 2:00pm on Friday, September 26, 2014 at St. Paul the Apostle Church located at 1536 Selby Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90024. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to The Prostate Cancer Foundation in Mr. Cotter's name: www.pcf.org/JamesCotter."

Two brothers are determined to find “something spectacular” in this clever second collaboration between Barnett and Klassen (after “Extra Yarn,” a Caldecott Honor book). As Sam and Dave apply shovels to dirt, their hole grows and grows, but their goal keeps eluding them. The prose is deadpan; the joke’s all in Klassen’s winsomely smudgy illustrations: There are gigantic jewels buried everywhere, except in the paths the boys dig. The dog, meanwhile, is after a prize of his own."
