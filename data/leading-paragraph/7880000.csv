It is impossible to fully describe a man such as he in any amount of paragragh or verse. Michael Robert Mueller was born October 6, 1946 in Decatur, IL. He endeavored to earn both bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering and finance from Cornell University, where he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Mr. Mueller sat on the board of directors of Mueller Co., developed large portions of Columbia, MD, and was involved with other successful projects throughout the world. He was last engaged in publishing and charitable pursuits. Michael was an accomplished golfer who was good enough to go pro - but happier not to. His body and mind were perpetually engaged in various simultaneous projects and experiments. All who knew him can take solace in knowing he now has the final solutions to all of them. Michael offered unwavering support and endless encouragement to his entire family. And all those fortunate to have crossed paths with him remember. He was preceded by his father, mother, and brother and is survived by three grandchildren, two children, and a brother. 1/3"

2015-09-15T00:00:00Z,"LIGOTTI--Albert F. Beloved husband, father, teacher, and friend, passed away Saturday, September 12, 2015, at the age of 88 years. His life-long love of music is his legacy to those who knew and loved him, and he generously shared that love with his world. Mr. Ligotti was born in Bronx, NY where he lived until 1968 when he moved to Athens, GA with his wife and daughters to begin a teaching career at the University of Georgia's Music Department. An Associate Professor Emeritus of Music, he served on the music faculty for 27 years teaching trumpet and conducting. He was the founder and director of the UGA Wind Ensemble, played in the UGA Faculty Brass Quintet, and served as music director of the Opera/MusicTheatre in association with the UGA Department of Drama and Theatre. Prior to his appointment at UGA, Mr. Ligotti performed as a professional trumpet player for eleven years with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. He also performed with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the Boston Pops with Arthur Fiedler, as trumpet soloist with the Knickerbocker Chamber Players, the New York City Opera and Ballet companies, the Goldman Band, the Bell Telephone Television Orchestra, the Radio City Music Hall Orchestra, in Broadway show ensembles, and in brass quintets. Mr. Ligotti studied conducting under Michael Fiviesky with coaching from Pierre Monteaux. He held a bachelor's degree from Queen's College and a master's degree from Columbia University. He was active as an adjudicator, clinician, and guest conductor throughout the southeast and arranged and transcribed music, with many works published and professionally recorded. His accomplishments include election to full membership in the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He was the recipient of the 1999-2000 Bank of America Man of Achievement Award and received the Distinguished Alumni Music Award from Queen's College. As a young man just graduated from Queen's College, he chose to serve his country by enlisting in the United States Coast Guard and was a member of their distinguished Coast Guard Band. The Band developed an international reputation as one of the finest professional concert bands in the world, offering music of great variety and appeal, and he was proud and privileged to be a part of that organization. In the late 1970s, Mr. Ligotti was approached about forming a community orchestra in the Athens, GA area. With the help of the then Office of Cultural Affairs and Jill Read, its director, the plans went ahead, and in the Fall of 1978 the first Board of Directors was selected and the Symphony's charter received from the State of Georgia. In the month of January 1979, the Symphony began rehearsing in the band room of Clarke Central High School and subsequently presented its first concert on April 29, 1979, in Mell Auditorium. Thereafter, under his leadership, grateful musicians who had been given the opportunity to play before family, friends and the community through the Athens Symphony performed consistently before enthusiastic audiences of 2,000 in the Classic Center. Due to health considerations, in 2012 Mr. Ligotti handed over his baton to Susan Dinwiddie, and the Symphony Orchestra, that marvelous gift to the Athens community begun so long ago, continues to this day. Patrons of the Athens Symphony continue to be delighted with the elegant bronze sculpture of Maestro Albert Ligotti produced by Gregory Johnson, Artist. This sculpture can be seen in the lobby of the Classic Center. the Symphony's home since 1996. Mr. Ligotti is survived by his loving wife of 50 years Arlene F. Ligotti, daughter Fran Rothman Prince of Athens, GA, and his brother Raymond Ligotti of Long Island, NY. He was preceded in death by his daughter Jeannie Rothman and his parents Victor and Tilly Ligotti of Athens, GA. Lord & Stephens Funeral Home, Athens, GA, is in charge of services. Friends who wish may make a memorial contribution honoring Maestro Albert F. Ligotti to the Athens Symphony, P.O. Box 5244, Athens, GA 30604. No service is planned at this time. 1/3"

(McDonnell) McEvily, he is survived by his devoted wife of 33 years, Mary Ellen Foster McEvily, by his children, Thomas F. III (Mary), Richard P. (Michele), Ellie Murphy (Michael), Patrick (Ann), Mary McMillan (Keith) and Michael (Ellen), by his grandchildren, Christopher (Maureen), Peter (Sarah), Kathleen and Alison McEvily, Kyle (Jessica), Conor and Caitlin McEvily and Erin (Andrew) McArdle, Thomas Murphy, Katie, Patrick and Claire McEvily, Lizzie, Neil and Will McMillan and Megan, Thomas and Cara McEvily and by his great grandchildren, Daniel, Sean, Ryan, Alexandra, Kevin and Trevor. He was predeceased by his first wife, Catherine Shea McEvily, and by his daughter, Claire Keating McEvily. Tom graduated from Fordham Prep ('43), the United States Merchant Marine Academy ('45) and the University of Notre Dame ('50) and he was a proud and loyal alumnus of each school. He also served in the United States Navy during WW II. He was the President for many years of Keevily Spero Whitelaw, Inc. a successful insurance brokerage now located in Harrison, NY - which was founded by his father, greatly expanded by him and now managed by several of his children and grandchildren. However, what his family would like him to be most remembered for was that he was a man of great Catholic faith and that, especially in his retirement, he strongly lived that faith on a daily basis by serving his fellow man as a lay member of the Archdiocese of New York's Inter-Parish Finance Committee, as the President and long-time member of the Board of Directors of Abbott House, as a Eucharistic Minister for cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and, until most recently, as the leader of the Saturday Morning Homeless Breakfast Program for over 20 years at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church. Tom was a Knight of Malta and also served on the Board of Trustees of Fordham Prep and The Ursuline School. His lifelong pursuit of learning was found in his love of reading and in speaking French. He was an avid tennis player and sailor and vocal fan of Notre Dame Football and the New York Yankees. Truly a life well-lived.

2015-09-17T00:00:00Z,"HILL--Dorothy Helen, passed away peacefully in her home on Sunday, September 13. Born in Sheridan, Wyoming on July 6, 1917, Dorothy lived a long and fulfilled life, graced by a frontier spirit of fierce independence and a passion for helping others. She leaves behind family and friends, whose lives have been strengthened by her love, her mentoring and her enthusiasm for life. Dorothy's passions were wide-ranging... creating art, giving herself to community service, devoting herself to her four grandchildren, breaking the age barrier in Tai Chi classes and collecting as many pennies as she could at her weekly poker game at Kendal on Hudson. What family and friends will remember most about Dorothy was her genuine faith, and her belief that spirit transcends temporal life. Her library is populated with all persuasions of books dealing with spirituality, from Joan Chittister to Henri Nouwen. As an artist, who studied at the Art Students' League of New York, she was prolific and comfortable working in many mediums: drawing, painting, sculpture and collage. Her artworks include clay busts, bronze figurines, seascapes, and landscapes, demonstrating a willingness to take artistic risks in both abstraction and realism. Along with Helen Price, she founded the Art Committee and Art Room at Kendal and organized the Rue des Artistes shows, having a new show every two months. As a volunteer, in the 1940s and 1950s, Dorothy was a strong advocate for education, and in later decades she devoted much of her life to community service as a long standing Board member of the Community Service Society, among other organizations. As a beloved grandmother to Margot, Alexis, Astrid and Jamie, and a great-grand- mother to Eliza Joy, she relished the many opportunities to read to them, to play with them and to celebrate their chosen paths. As a firm believer that ""you become better with age,"" she took up yoga in her 60s and Tai Chi in her 70s. Never one to back away from a challenge, she decided ten years ago to forge a new life at Kendal on Hudson, where her clarity of thought kept pace with her physical prowess, up until the very end, as she celebrated her 98th birthday two months ago. Throughout her life, Dorothy found beauty and inspiration for her art and her spirit from the Wyoming mountains, the Cape Cod seas, and the Hudson River views at Kendal. As a devoted wife to James T. Hill, Jr., who predeceased her in 1978, Dorothy followed him east upon his graduation from Harvard Law School and never looked back. As her grandchildren would often say, ""You can take her out of Wyoming, but you can never take the Wyoming out of her!"" She leaves behind her loving children and daughter-in-law, Susan, Tom and Janine, her four devoted grandchildren, Margot, Alexis, Astrid and Jamie, and the newest joy in her life, her great-granddaughter, Lizzie, as well as countless friends whom she loved. Her lasting legacy to family and friends was her gift for making our time with her so much fun.

2015-09-17T00:00:00Z,"CAMPBELL--Castle Berry, 86, died peacefully at Calvary Hospital on August 7, 2015. Close friend. Beloved uncle. We miss him. Blessed with an easy smile and outgoing personality, Castle never met a stranger, nor forgot those who became friends. He was born in Big Spring, Texas, the son of James Campbell and the former Lula Mae Castle. A graduate of Big Spring High School, he attended Abilene Christian College (now Abilene Christian University) in Abilene, Texas; then moved to Dallas where he worked as a film booker for RKO Pictures. By the late 50s, Castle was working in New York City as an airline ticketing agent. That began a long and varied travel career which culminated at Loew's Hotels, where he worked in travel agency sales. During the Loew's years, he traveled almost constantly, domestically and abroad. Budapest, Cairo, Lisbon, Bangkok, Hamburg, and Taipei were some of the cities he visited and explored. Castle never tired of traveling and used his vacations to do even more. France was always a favorite and the source of many anecdotes, including the time he fell asleep on a sunny afternoon in a cow pasture surrounded by the magnificent Cirque de Gavarnie in the French Pyrenees. Another special travel moment was a motor launch cruise in New Zealand's spectacular Milford Sound. In recognition of his travel experience and industry credentials, Castle was elected a member of Skal, the international travel fraternity. Castle liked the theater, movies, mystery novels, Masterpiece Theater series, and was a fanatical fan of ""Keeping Up Appearances"". Then there was ballroom dancing. Just ask Skal or ASTA members who was the last guy to leave the dance floor at their dinner dances? After retiring from Loew's, Castle served as a volunteer docent at Carnegie Hall for 20+ years and continued to travel. Castle was preceded in death by a brother, Woodrow Campbell, a sister, Dorothea Evans, nephews Warren Evans and Jim Pat Campbell, and a much beloved first cousin, Janice Dunagan. He is survived by Malcolm Crawford, his long time friend who patiently cared for him during the final months, a niece, Judy Schoen of Terrell, Texas, two nephews, Roger Evans of Oslo, Norway and Joe Keith Campbell of Tulsa, Oklahoma plus several cousins and a host of great nieces and nephews. Castle adopted New York as his home, but never forgot his Texas roots. He loved his family and friends, never forgot them and kept up with what they were doing until his demise. Interment services will be held at Mount Olive Cemetery in Big Spring, Texas at 11am on Saturday, September 26, 2015. A reception and lunch will follow at the Hotel Settles.

2015-09-20T00:00:00Z,"BELSON--Jerome. Builder, lawyer, philanthropist, visionary, sportsman, devoted friend, loving family man and larger than life personality. All of these labels describe Jerry Belson, who passed away peacefully on Thursday, September 17 surrounded by his family. He lived many lifetimes in his 90 years, working his entire life to improve the lives of others through the thousands of apartments he helped build and maintain, to the many charities he supported, to the numerous industry groups and companies he led and advised, to the endless advice and support he provided to family and friends. His wide and varied circle of friends and colleagues were testament to a life spent working in and for the community. He helped build affordable housing across the city and Jerome Belson Associates was a leading manager of apartments. He served on boards as varied as Waterhouse Securities, a leading discount broker, to the Doe Fund, a non-profit group dedicated to helping formerly homeless men and women become self-sufficient, to St. John's University. A long-time congregant at Temple Beth Emeth in Brooklyn, he was also chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, a trustee of the National Jewish Fund, Handicapped Boy Scouts and the Disabled and Alone/Life Services for the Handicapped, Inc. Motivated by their son, Tad, Jerry and Maxine, his late wife of 55 years, helped create New Hope Community in Loch Sheldrake, NY, to promote the independence of people with intellectual disabilities. He worked tirelessly for St. John's University as a trustee for more than 20 years, forever thankful for the law degree and the honorary doctorate he earned there. Tad provided the idea for Belson Stadium, a soccer stadium on the St. John's campus. Jerome and Maxine Belson Hall, which houses the School of Law and the Belson Moot Courtroom, speak to Jerry's enduring commitment to law and his alma mater. He played an outsized role as a family patriarch. Predeceased by Maxine and son Michael (Kathy), he is survived by his son Tad, daughter Brianne (Sanford), brother Victor and grandchildren Matthew (Jodi), Joshua (Katy), Jaclyn, Toby, and Jonathan, and three great grandchildren Noah, Ariel, and Paisley, and many cousins, nieces and nephews. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Jerry graduated from Lafayette High School and enrolled in Brooklyn College. After a stint in the U.S. Army during and after World War II, he graduated from St. John's Law School in 1948. Working as an assistant corporation counsel for the city, he helped prosecute racketeers. From an early age, Jerry had a gift for getting things done. In his 20s, he worked with the Knights Before Christmas to help underprivileged children, built clubhouses for the Boys' Club, helped war veterans and was director of an old age home. After entering private practice, at the behest of his father, Joseph, who became the president of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of America, he worked in real estate. His first development, in Brooklyn in 1952, was affordable housing for soldiers returning home. He went on to create 25,000 more apartments in the city, all non- profit co-ops. From 1955 to 2005, Jerry managed 50,000 apartments through Jerome Belson Associates. His relationships with members of federal, state and city agencies led to his involvement in Mitchell-Lama housing and noteworthy projects such as Roosevelt Island in Queens, Concourse Village in the Bronx and Jamie Towers, named after his son, Jamie Tad. Because of his friendship with President John F. Kennedy, Jerry went on five mission trips with the American Institute for Free Labor Development to Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil and Columbia to create non-profit housing there. He worked for decades with the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, Inc., eventually becoming and winning the Fred C. Trump Award for lifetime achievement. He was the first person from New York City to be inducted into the New York State Builders Association Hall of Fame. He started We Media, a magazine devoted to people with disabilities, built a bakery that employed the disabled in Maine, and traveled to Rome with the St. John's 1996 NCAA champion soccer team to meet His Holiness, Pope John Paul II. When honored by Rome as affiliates of the Vincentian community, Jerry and Maxine said they wanted their legacy to be simple: ""That we cared."" The funeral will be held Sunday September 20th at 12pm at Community Synagogue of Rye, 200 Forest Ave, Rye, NY.

Born in Philadelphia, Kerry was raised in Seattle prior to the family settling outside of Chicago. Kerry's culinary passion and curiosity was sparked as he experimented preparing recipes from a Julia Child cookbook after working shifts, flipping pizzas at Little Caesar's alongside friend and co-worker Bill Murray. Working hard, Kerry received a scholarship to attend the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, NY. Upon graduation, Kerry worked under such culinary luminaries as Jean-Jacque Rachou, Andre Soltner and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But it was at Donald and Ivana Trump's New York Plaza Hotel, in the Edwardian Room kitchen, that the Chef first achieved his own fame thanks to the countless celebrities he served at his private table inside his kitchen. It was a phenomenon; Rock 'n' Roll royalty loved Kerry's food. Kerry is survived by his brothers Glen, Doug, Scott and nieces, Meg Santoro and Sophie Sue Simon. A memorial celebrating the life of Kerry Simon, Chef, friend and one of the kindest human beings in the world is planned for October 18th, 2015 in Las Vegas.

He attended Dalton and Lincoln Schools, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Middlebury College and received a Masters degree in American History from Columbia University. As a member of the United States Army, he served in France and Germany after WWII. Sandy was a partner and Director of Research at L.F.

She rose swiftly through Ferris & Company and was admitted as a general partner in 1965. In 1977 Gail was appointed Vice Chairman.

Former UN delegate, public health advocate, distinguished philanthropist. Born in Tripoli, Lebanon in 1925, she graduated from The American University of Beirut in 1947 and earned a Masters in Public Health education from UC Berkeley a few years later. Brilliant, charismatic and fearless, she began her career in Libya, where she worked as a health advisor to the government, and helped develop their national public health program. Soon after, she was appointed as a Lebanese delegate to the United Nations, and was one of only a few females to assume such a post. In 1961, she married Elmer Bobst, a successful businessman and pharmaceutical executive who shared her interests in public health. He was a leader in the war on cancer, and a driving force behind former President Nixon's signing of the National Cancer Act in 1971. Together, Elmer and Mamdouha created The Bobst Foundation. Their first major joint contribution was The NYU Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, in 1973. After Elmer died in 1978, Mrs. Bobst took over as president of the foundation and continued its mission of and devotion to philanthropy, making numerous significant and transformative donations to the fields of medicine and health, education, social justice and animal welfare. While impossible to list all the generous activities of the Bobst Foundation, key beneficiaries include: New York University; NYU Langone Medical Center; Princeton University (The Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice); The American University of Beirut (The Elmer and Mamdouha El-Sayed Bobst Chemistry Center); The American University of Beirut Medical Center (The Mamdouha El-Sayed Bobst Breast Unit); Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (The Bobst International Center and The Bobst Pavilion); and The Animal Medical Center (The Elmer and Mamdouha Bobst Hospital). The Bobst Foundation has also donated generously throughout the years to the American Cancer Society and the ASPCA. Mrs. Bobst set up numerous scholarship funds for several universities across the world, as well as fellowship programs throughout various medical colleges. Whether it concerned social justice issues or cancer research, The Bobst Foundation fostered alliances between global institutions to encourage active dialogue and exchange of ideas. Mrs. Bobst was a woman of great humility and faith, who adopted and lived American values while never forgetting her homeland, Lebanon. She will be dearly missed by her friends and family for her wisdom, work ethic, generosity, and relentless dedication to changing the world. She will be forever remembered for the thousands of people she helped to educate, and the thousands of lives that she helped to save. May she and her beloved husband Elmer, now united, rest in peace. Mrs. Bobst is survived by one brother, three sisters, many nieces and nephews, and extended family living all around the world. 1/3"

2015-09-20T00:00:00Z,"STAMEY--Thomas A.,MD. Professor Emeritus of Urology at Stanford University School of Medicine and a noted leader in the study and treatment of prostate cancer, died Friday, September 4, 2015, at his home in Portola Valley, CA. He was 87. At Stanford, Stamey developed the PSA blood test for prostate cancer and helped transform urology and surgery from purely clinical fields to research fields. In 1989 he became the first urologist ever elected to the Institute of Medicine. He was also named an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. ""He was truly one of the giants in academic urology, with his biggest impact in prostate cancer. His research formed the basis of much of what we know about prostate cancer today. He trained over 100 residents and fellows, many of whom went on to be leaders in urology in their own right. His permanent influence in the field is assured"", stated Eila Skinner, MD, professor and chair of Urology at Stanford. Born in North Carolina in 1928, he worked with his parents in their general store as a young boy, going on to attend Virgina Military Institute for two years then graduating from Vanderbilt University. Medical training was at Johns Hopkins University where he earned his MD, did his internship and urology residency. He served on the faculty there from 1958 to 196l, (after serving two years as Urological Consultant for the United States Air Force in the United Kingdom). In 196l he was recruited to Stanford University School of Medicine to serve as Chairman of Urology, a position he held for 33 years. One of his great achievements there was to make one year of research in the laboratory a requirement of the resident's training, which was almost unique compared to many other parts of the country. ""People talk about translational medicine now, but we were doing it back then. That research focus was the reason"", stated Linda Shortliffe, MD, a resident from 1977 to 1981. Stamey authored or co- authored more than 225 scientific papers, four books, 30 textbook chapters and seven monographs. Among many other awards, he received the Hugh Hampton Young award and the Ramon Guiteras Award from the American Urological Association and the Valentine Award from the New York Academy of Medicine. He was a resident scholar at the Rockefeller Foundation Study and Conference Center in Bellagio, Italy, and had a sabbatical year at Oxford University, England. Many former residents, when hearing of Dr. Stamey's death commented on their memories of their training, and of still hearing his soft, but authoritative, North Carolina accented voice (not very common in the West) even today while working in the operating room, or sometimes in their sleep. Dr. Stamey was devoted to his family and is survived by his wife Kathryn, and children Frederick, Charline (Douty), Alex, Theron (Cooper) and Allison. 1/3"

And with Bill behind us, the discoveries flowed. Dr. Bill Paul's worldwide impact on biomedical research and on lupus is enormous.

2015-09-21T00:00:00Z,"BELSON--Jerome. Builder, lawyer, philanthropist, visionary, sportsman, devoted friend, loving family man and larger than life personality. All of these labels describe Jerry Belson, who passed away peacefully on Thursday, September 17 surrounded by his family. He lived many lifetimes in his 90 years, working his entire life to improve the lives of others through the thousands of apartments he helped build and maintain, to the many charities he supported, to the numerous industry groups and companies he led and advised, to the endless advice and support he provided to family and friends. His wide and varied circle of friends and colleagues were testament to a life spent working in and for the community. He helped build affordable housing across the city and Jerome Belson Associates was a leading manager of apartments. He served on boards as varied as Waterhouse Securities, a leading discount broker, to the Doe Fund, a non-profit group dedicated to helping formerly homeless men and women become self-sufficient, to St. John's University. A long-time congregant at Temple Beth Emeth in Brooklyn, he was also chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, a trustee of the National Jewish Fund, Handicapped Boy Scouts and the Disabled and Alone/Life Services for the Handicapped, Inc. Motivated by their son, Tad, Jerry and Maxine, his late wife of 55 years, helped create New Hope Community in Loch Sheldrake, NY, to promote the independence of people with intellectual disabilities. He worked tirelessly for St. John's University as a trustee for more than 20 years, forever thankful for the law degree and the honorary doctorate he earned there. Tad provided the idea for Belson Stadium, a soccer stadium on the St. John's campus. Jerome and Maxine Belson Hall, which houses the School of Law and the Belson Moot Courtroom, speak to Jerry's enduring commitment to law and his alma mater. He played an outsized role as a family patriarch. Predeceased by Maxine and son Michael (Kathy), he is survived by his son Tad, daughter Brianne (Sanford), brother Victor and grandchildren Matthew (Jodi), Joshua (Katy), Jaclyn, Toby, and Jonathan, and three great grandchildren Noah, Ariel, and Paisley, and many cousins, nieces and nephews. Born and raised in Brooklyn, Jerry graduated from Lafayette High School and enrolled in Brooklyn College. After a stint in the U.S. Army during and after World War II, he graduated from St. John's Law School in 1948. Working as an assistant corporation counsel for the city, he helped prosecute racketeers. From an early age, Jerry had a gift for getting things done. In his 20s, he worked with the Knights Before Christmas to help underprivileged children, built clubhouses for the Boys' Club, helped war veterans and was director of an old age home. After entering private practice, at the behest of his father, Joseph, who became the president of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of America, he worked in real estate. His first development, in Brooklyn in 1952, was affordable housing for soldiers returning home. He went on to create 25,000 more apartments in the city, all non- profit co-ops. From 1955 to 2005, Jerry managed 50,000 apartments through Jerome Belson Associates. His relationships with members of federal, state and city agencies led to his involvement in Mitchell-Lama housing and noteworthy projects such as Roosevelt Island in Queens, Concourse Village in the Bronx and Jamie Towers, named after his son, Jamie Tad. Because of his friendship with President John F. Kennedy, Jerry went on five mission trips with the American Institute for Free Labor Development to Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil and Columbia to create non-profit housing there. He worked for decades with the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, Inc., eventually becoming and winning the Fred C. Trump Award for lifetime achievement. He was the first person from New York City to be inducted into the New York State Builders Association Hall of Fame. He started We Media, a magazine devoted to people with disabilities, built a bakery that employed the disabled in Maine, and traveled to Rome with the St. John's 1996 NCAA champion soccer team to meet His Holiness, Pope John Paul II. When honored by Rome as affiliates of the Vincentian community, Jerry and Maxine said they wanted their legacy to be simple: ""That we cared."" The funeral will be held Sunday September 20th at 12pm at Community Synagogue of Rye, 200 Forest Ave, Rye, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to New Hope Community, Inc., a home for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. 1/3"

Dr. Root has been a cornerstone of HSS since joining the staff in 1967. He considered himself an orthopedic family doctor who cared for patients from childhood through their adulthood, but we recognized him as one of the nation's foremost specialists in pediatric orthopedics. His contributions to patient care, medical education and research were extraordinary. During his 27-year tenure as Chief of Pediatric Orthopedics at HSS, he established New York City's first clinic for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, founded New York State's first Pediatric Orthopedic Outreach Program, and expanded the Hospital's Cerebral Palsy Clinic. Dr Root's many other accomplishments and contributions include serving as President of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and authoring books that received wide acclaim. Born and raised in New Jersey, Dr. Root attended Rutgers University on a War Memorial Scholarship. Interested in medicine since boyhood, he went on to attend New York Medical College on a partial scholarship and later interned as a general practitioner at New Jersey's Beth Israel Hospital. From there, he went into the U.S. Navy where his interest in orthopedics developed. Upon his honorable discharge from the Navy, he did his residency at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson, NJ, followed by a one-year fellowship at Hospital for Special Surgery and the start of an exemplary career. We honor Dr Root's extraordinary legacy of selfless care and character as an obligation to the communities and Hospital we serve. On behalf of the HSS Family, we extend our greatest sympathies and appreciation to Dr Root's wife Paula, their children Matthew and Lillian, and their four grandchildren. Kendrick R.

Haer and her sister-in-law, Sally Haer; her children - John H. (Carol-Ann), H. Craig (Lora), Bruce D. (Virginia), Peter S. (Irene), Scott R. (Jo-Ellen), Pamela H. Treiber Baldwin; 18 grandchildren, and many nieces, nephews, and loving friends. Hope was predeceased by her husband Howard, her sister Joan, her niece Robin Gross, and her parents Henry C. and Mae Lillian (Murphy) Haer. Hope was born in Morristown, NJ, and raised in Sayville, NY, where she played soccer and was a Sayville High School cheerleader. She was proud of her participation in the war effort as a plane spotter in the tower of the old Sayville High School. She went on to graduate from St. John's Episcopal Hospital Nursing School as a RN. Hope married Howard F. Treiber on November 25, 1949 and moved to Old Brookville in 1955 where they raised their six children. Hope loved her home most when it was filled with her children and their friends and in later years with her grandchildren. She enjoyed being very active all her life with golf, tennis, jogging, and until only several years ago, working out at the YMCA at Glen Cove. Hope's love of nature and living things was a passion all her life, whether feeding birds, watching baby birds in her birdhouses, butterflies, insects, bird nests, and her ever-blooming garden and house plants. Hope was an accomplished crossword aficionado and a dedicated Jeopardy fan. She was a fiercely independent lady, with an indomitable spirit and will, and she always put other's needs and sensitivities ahead of hers throughout her life. Hope's unconditional love and support became the strength of her family. She was a remarkable mother and grandmother and will be missed so very much. Hope did not believe in death but rather in life, and in accordance with her wishes, there will be no wake but a memorial service on Saturday, October 24, at 2pm, at St. Paul's Episcopal Church on Highland Avenue, Glen Cove.

2015-09-26T00:00:00Z,"BOXILL--Professor Roger, (27 March 1928 to 15 September 2015) As a boy, Roger attended the Little Red School House in Greenwich Village, and New York's Professional Children's School and High School of Music and Art. After training at the Royal Academy in London, he was an actor on Stage and Television. Of his many roles his favorite was Prince Hal in Shakespeare's I Henry IV. Later he took a PhD at Columbia University and joined the English Department at the City College of CUNY. Not surprisingly, his preferred course as an instructor was Shakespeare, which he taught many times. During this time he also was a respected director of theater productions in the New York area. As a critic of drama he published two books, one on Bernard Shaw's views on health and the medical profession and the other on the plays of Tennessee Williams. His interest in the exotic led him to travel up the Nile to see the pyramids and to explore other parts of the Middle East. Somewhat closer to home, he spent a year as Adjunct Professor of English at the University of Paris. In 1993 he retired from academic life. He had long been an ardent tennis player, and continued honing his game in retirement, but his primary study was the singing of choral and solo music. He was an avid student of voice and music theory, sang in many venerable New York choruses, became a devoted member of the ""Friday Night"" singing group and released a recording of his favorite songs and arias several years ago. Roger had no immediate family, but his many friends will miss him deeply. Please inquire at oaklandopensing@gmail.com to send remembrances and for information about a celebration of his life in early November. 1/3"

2015-09-26T00:00:00Z,"CRATE--Marian K. (Keil), 76, beloved wife of William R. Crate, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, September 1st, at her home. Born in the Bronx, New York, she is the daughter of the late William E. and Marie Deibold Keil. Marian struggled in her later years with a debilitating neurological disease. Always elegant, she never left home without wearing lipstick, and will be remembered as an active and vivacious woman. Marian was born and raised in the Bronx and a true New Yorker, down to her accent. She attended New York public schools as a child, and graduated from Freeport High School on Long Island. Marian was a woman of adventure, embracing excitement without fear - a trait she passed on to her sons and her grandchildren. In her early twenties, Marian was known to drive around New York City in a car that had no brakes, stopping only when she yanked the emergency brake. This later manifested itself in an early driving lesson with her son Bradley when they were traveling on the George Washington Bridge. Marian decided suddenly that she and her son were going the wrong way. So she pulled a U-turn right at the end of the bridge. It was a lot of fun for Bradley, but the police did not think so. In her youth, Marian was a model and a stewardess until she met a Naval Aviator named William Robert Crate, whom she married in 1961. Together they raised two sons, Darrell and Bradley, along with numerous pets. Marian was a devoted wife and mother, and an active volunteer in her sons' schools, serving as a classroom mother for each of her sons in every year. She held a deep sense of conviction in her sons' abilities and offered complete support for their endeavors, whatever they were. She was always proud of their efforts, regardless of result, and strove to give them the unflappable courage that comes from a strong and loving support system. Marian now has a chance to be in heaven with her parents, both of whom she lost at a very early age, her brother Charles, who passed away earlier this year, and her daughter-in-law Natalie, who passed away in 2014. In addition to her devoted husband William, with whom she shared 54 years of marriage, Marian is survived her two loving sons, Darrell W. Crate, of Beverly Farms, MA, and Bradley T. Crate of Beverly Farms, MA, and five grandchildren: William R. Crate II; Emma W. Crate; Audrey T. Crate; Elizabeth L. Crate; and Helena R. Crate. She is predeceased by her brother Charles E. Crate and her daughter-in-law Natalie W. Crate. Visiting hours will be held from 2:00pm--3:30pm at the Campbell Funeral Home, 525 Cabot Street, Beverly, MA on Tuesday, September 29th with remembrances taking place at 3:30pm. Relatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend. The burial will be held at the Pleasant Grove Cemetery in Manchester-by-the-Sea, MA immediately following the remembrances. Memorial donations may be made in Marian's Memory to Stop3.org, a foundation dedicated to brain cancer research at 138 Conant Street, 2nd Floor, Beverly, MA 01915.

As a critic of drama he published two books, one on Bernard Shaw's views on health and the medical profession and the other on the plays of Tennessee Williams. His interest in the exotic led him to travel up the Nile to see the pyramids and to explore other parts of the Middle East. Somewhat closer to home, he spent a year as Adjunct Professor of English at the University of Paris. In 1993 he retired from academic life. He had long been an ardent tennis player, and continued honing his game in retirement, but his primary study was the singing of choral and solo music. He was an avid student of voice and music theory, sang in many venerable New York choruses, became a devoted member of the ""Friday Night"" singing group and released a recording of his favorite songs and arias several years ago.

2015-09-29T00:00:00Z,"RAINWATER--Richard Edward, philanthropist, legendary and renowned investor, father, husband, mentor, loyal friend and native Texan, passed away September 27, 2015 at his home in Fort Worth. He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and Matthew Rainwater as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and niece, Kelley. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. ""A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,"" said Darla Moore, ""and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young. Not many people are generous with their time when mentoring young people. Richard was the exception."" Richard has not made any public appearances since 2010. His son, Matthew said his father was the personification of heroism as he battled the illness. ""There is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened. He was determined to embrace every available moment with his loved ones, and he resolved to establish a robust platform for long term research into tauopathies such as PSP and Alzheimer's Disease,"" said Matthew. ""It's another example of him actually 'willing' something into reality."" Richard's life was undoubtedly extended because of the extraordinary care he received over the last five and a half years. The family is deeply appreciative of Stephen Boyd, Jerry Harper, Robert Patterson, Eric Thompson, Barry Less, Norman Finley, Rick Castle, Scott Rhode and Bonnie Dears. Their loving, professional and attentive care added much quality to Richard's life. Former President George W. Bush partnered with Richard and Rusty Rose in 1989 to purchase the Texas Rangers MLB club. Mr. Bush issued a statement about his friend. ""I was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart. He was a lot of fun, inspiring to be around, and generous and courageous to the very end. Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Darla, and to the children he was so proud of: Matthew, Courtney, and Todd. We also send our condolences to his loyal brother, Walter, and to Richard's family, friends, and staff who loved and cared for him."" Those sentiments were echoed across the country from Deepdale Country Club where the flags flew at half-mast to the offices of some of the most powerful people in business to a family that Richard seeded money in order to teach a colleague's children how to give money to worthy charities. Richard's friend Ken Hersh called the loss of his friend immeasurable. ""I truly believe he was the godfather of the North American private investment business,"" Hersh told the News. He created an atmosphere and environment where accomplished, ambitious, entrepreneurial and creative people could work."" With all of his business success, family and friends were paramount to Richard, and they describe him as playful. In fact, once he was quoted as saying, ""I don't feel like it's in anybody's interest to take themselves and life so seriously that they can't have fun."" Richard's ""fun"" came on the golf course, and he was once a partner in the famed Pebble Beach Golf Club. He also invented a new form of friendly competitive golf for rounds with friends; the game was labeled as ""Two Ball."" A self-described fitness fanatic, Richard, prior to the onset of his illness, was an avid marathon runner. He also loved motorsports and sponsored cars, most notably a 1957 ""muscle car,"" in competitions. Born June 15, 1944 to Walter J. Rainwater Sr. a wholesale grocer, and Regina Dieb Rainwater, a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Richard treasured his Texas roots. He grew up in his native Fort Worth, graduating from R.L. Paschal High School, and he remained a steadfast Panthers fan. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas and had an MBA from Stanford University. At age 26, Sid Bass, a former classmate, hired Rainwater as an investment manager for the Bass family fortune. He directed the Bass fortune of $50 million into $5 billion between 1970 and 1986. In fact, he assisted Michael Eisner when he was Disney CEO to increase his fortune into billions of dollars. In 1986, Richard started his own firm, Rainwater Inc and successfully acquired stakes in companies such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Ensco International, Pioneer Natural Resources, Mid Ocean Limited and Crescent Real Estate Equities. His success as an investor is legendary, prompting The New York Times to describe him this week as a ""quiet mover of wealth and power"" in the country. Services to celebrate a man whose life can be defined by its optimism, generosity, belief in his loved ones as well as his colleagues and friends will be held Friday, October 2, 2015 at Broadway Baptist Church, 305 W. Broadway Avenue, Fort Worth, Texas at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be offered to the Rainwater Neurological Research Fund, www.cfntx.org/rainwater.

2015-09-30T00:00:00Z,"RAINWATER--Richard. Richard Edward Rainwater, philanthropist, legendary and renowned investor, father, husband, mentor, loyal friend and native Texan, passed away September 27, 2015 at his home in Fort Worth. He was 71. Since 2009, Richard fought valiantly against a debilitating and rare neurological disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Along with his family's foundation, he spent the latter part of his life funding and actively engaging the international medical community to launch a bold research effort to combat PSP and discover a cure. His significant investment into brain research and neurodegenerative diseases has been called transformational; the goal is to find a treatment for brain-related diseases. Richard is survived by his wife Darla Moore and three children from a prior marriage, Courtney Rainwater, Todd Rainwater and his wife Lowisa; and Matthew Rainwater and his wife Jessica; as well as Richard's brother, Walter Rainwater, sister-in-law, Lori and nieces, Kelley and Kathryn. He also leaves behind hundreds of friends, business colleagues and people Richard mentored and launched into entrepreneurship as well as the numerous causes he funded and the countless individuals who were deeply touched by his generosity. ""A person's legacy is truly who they leave behind,"" said Darla Moore, ""and Richard populated this country with extraordinary talent that he recognized when they were very young. Not many people are generous with their time when mentoring young people. Richard was the exception."" Richard has not made any public appearances since 2010. His son, Matthew said his father was the personification of heroism as he battled the illness. ""There is an extraordinary untold story about his heroism and bravery as the symptoms worsened. He was determined to embrace every available moment with his loved ones, and he resolved to establish a robust platform for long term research into tauopathies such as PSP and Alzheimer's Disease,"" said Matthew. ""It's another example of him actually 'willing' something into reality."" Richard's life was undoubtedly extended because of the extraordinary care he received over the last five and a half years. The family is deeply appreciative of Stephen Boyd, Jerry Harper, Robert Patterson, Eric Thompson, Barry Lee, Norman Finley, Rick Castle, Scott Rhode and Bennie Dears. Their loving, professional and attentive care added much quality to Richard's life. Former President George W. Bush partnered with Richard and Rusty Rose in 1989 to purchase the Texas Rangers MLB club. Mr. Bush issued a statement about his friend. ""I was so saddened to learn that my friend Richard Rainwater died this weekend. Richard had a brilliant mind and a generous heart. He was a lot of fun, inspiring to be around, and generous and courageous to the very end. Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Darla, and to the children he was so proud of: Matthew, Courtney, and Todd. We also send our condolences to his loyal brother, Walter, and to Richard's family, friends, and staff who loved and cared for him."" Those sentiments were echoed across the country from Deepdale Country Club where the flags flew at half-mast to the offices of some of the most powerful people in business to a family that Richard seeded money in order to teach a colleague's children how to give money to worthy charities. Richard's friend Ken Hersh called the loss of his friend immeasurable. ""I truly believe he was the godfather of the North American private investment business,"" Hersh said. He created an atmosphere and environment where accomplished, ambitious, entrepreneurial and creative people could work."" With all of his business success, family and friends were paramount to Richard, and they describe him as playful. In fact, once he was quoted as saying, ""I don't feel like it's in anybody's interest to take themselves and life so seriously that they can't have fun."" Richard's ""fun"" came on the golf course, and he was once a partner in the famed Pebble Beach Golf Club. He also invented a new form of friendly competitive golf for rounds with friends; the game was labeled as ""Two Ball."" A self-described fitness fanatic, Richard, prior to the onset of his illness, was an avid marathon runner. He also loved motorsports and sponsored cars, most notably a 1957 ""muscle car,"" in competitions. Born June 15, 1944 to Walter J. Rainwater Sr. a wholesale grocer, and Regina Dieb Rainwater, a J.C. Penney sales clerk, Richard treasured his Texas roots. He grew up in his native Fort Worth, graduating from R.L. Paschal High School, and he remained a steadfast Panthers fan. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas and had an MBA from Stanford University. At age 26, Sid Bass, a former classmate, hired Rainwater as an investment manager for the Bass family fortune. He directed the Bass fortune of $50 million into $5 billion between 1970 and 1986. In fact, he assisted Michael Eisner when he was Disney CEO to increase his fortune into billions of dollars. In 1986, Richard started his own firm, Rainwater Inc and successfully acquired stakes in companies such as Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Ensco International, Pioneer Natural Resources, Mid Ocean Limited and Crescent Real Estate Equities. His success as an investor is legendary, prompting The New York Times to describe him this week as a ""quiet mover of wealth and power"" in the country. Services to celebrate a man whose life can be defined by its optimism, generosity, belief in his loved ones as well as his colleagues and friends will be held Friday, October 2, 2015 at Broadway Baptist Church, 305 W. Broadway Avenue, Fort Worth, Texas at 11:00am. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be offered to the Rainwater Neurological Research Fund, www.cfntx.org/rainwater.

2015-10-02T00:00:00Z,"BROWN--Thomas Steele. (March 12, 1932 - October 2, 1990), neuropsychologist and father, took his own life 25 years ago today, after a life long battle with manic- depression, or as it is called today, bi-polar disorder. My father was betrayed, and utterly undone by some fault of his brain chemistry or arrhythmia of its circuitry. He spent the best years of his life and career researching the structures of the human brain, a twist both bitter and ironic. His depression today would probably be termed treatment resistant depression. But he was also unable to benefit from all of the advances in pharmacology and treatment which have occurred in the past quarter century. My father wrote a text book entitled Physiological Psychology, published in 1980. Reading the section on depression and manic depression, is especially poignant for me. He succinctly described what was then known about the disorder, its symptoms, and treatment. On those pages he was describing himself. Did he know he had it? If so, tragically, he did not seek treatment. Depression took a heavy toll on my father, and on all aspects of his life, during the ups and downs of his illness his family, his work and research also fell victim. He made bad, audaciously poor decisions - which lead to even further immiseration. Depression is a disease of loneliness. My father never talked about it. But he should have. It would have helped him to know that someone was paying attention. I tried to - but when I was a child, adolescent, and young man I had no real understanding of the nature of depression. The last decade of his life was terribly hard, his suffering must have been intense. He wanted so desperately to live -but eventually he reached a point of despair where he just could not hold on any longer. My father was a wonderful, lovely, and, very kind man. He had that particular degree of empathy those who have known suffering can have. His kindness is what I remember best. I never had the chance to forgive him for all that went wrong, but more importantly: I never thanked him for all that went right and for all the good he did. I never told him all that he meant to me, how much I truly loved him, or - goodbye. Dr. Thomas S. Brown was my father. I loved him. And I will miss him forevermore. 1/3"

2015-10-02T00:00:00Z,"MacARTHUR--Dugald, passed away early Tuesday morning, September 29, 2015, as a result of Alzheimer's disease. Mr. MacArthur, beloved by many in the Philadelphia theater community, was last seen ""on the boards"" when he received the 2009 Barrymore Lifetime Achievement Award, Philadelphia's version of the Tony Awards. This was a highpoint in a long and illustrious career in the theater. Mr. MacArthur was born in Birmingham, AL in 1929. The son of a prominent businessman, he was groomed to do the same. Educated at Kent School in Connecticut, he received his B.A. from Dartmouth College and finally his M.B.A. from Harvard University. He had no real experience in the theater until a friend took him to see a production at Baylor University in Waco, TX directed by the famous innovator, Paul Baker. He knew immediately that theater was what he wanted to do. After receiving his M.A. from Baylor, Mr. MacArthur was hired as the Director of the Arkansas Arts Center - funded generously by Winthrop Rockefeller. He established a professional theater degree program that produced actors of national recognition. His production of a play about the state prison system was suppressed before it opened, and evolved into the movie Brubaker with Robert Redford and Jane Alexander. Mr. MacArthur was then appointed as chairman of the Theater Department at San Francisco State University during the time of student riots against the Vietnam War. During that explosive time, he directed Marat Sade. A year later, he was approached by Herbert Blau, then co-director of the Julliard School, and Robert Corrigan, founder of the NYU TISCH School of the Arts, to join them in the creation of a new college training program funded by the Disney family. Mr. MacArthur recruited students and formulated the curriculum of what is now The California Institute of the Arts. Three years later, Mr. MacArthur was chosen to lead the Master of Fine Arts program in Theater for Temple University. During his twenty-five years at Temple, he recruited and trained many actors who continue to work and thrive in the profession. He also directed many plays, notably: ""Noises Off,"" ""The Time of your Life,"" ""Our Country's Good,"" ""Three Sisters"" and ""The Cherry Orchard."" His production of ""Moby Dick Rehearsed"" won the Best Ensemble at the American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Regionally, he directed at People's Light & Theatre Company, Villanova Shakespeare Company, The Pennsylvania Festival for New Plays, Philadelphia Theatre Company, and Act II Playhouse. He also directed at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, the Hopkins Center at Dartmouth College, The Loeb Drama Center at Harvard University, and StageWest in Springfield, MA. After retiring from Temple University, Mr. MacArthur was a director, consultant and board member for the Lantern Theater. He directed several plays for Lantern including ""The Bacchae,"" ""Speed the Plow,"" ""Copenhagen"" and ""Novecento."" He was nominated for a Barrymore award in 1998 for ""The Steward of Christendom,"" and also won a Barrymore in 1996 for his direction of ""The Lower Depths"" for The Venture Theater. Mr. MacArthur is survived by his wife, Christine, daughters Gwyneth, Meredith, and Alexandra, his son, Lorne, grandchildren, Kira Hanlan, Brigid and Rhys MacArthur- Thompson, and three great- grandchildren: Maeve, Fiona, and Colleen Dougherty. Memorial Service will be held at 3pm on Monday, October 5, 2015, The Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral, 19 S. 38th Street, Philadelphia, PA. A reception will follow the service. In lieu of flowers, donations in Dugald's memory may be made in support of the Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Center at Jefferson University Hospital.

The cause was lung cancer. Bill was born in Jackson, Michigan on December 22, 1928. He graduated from Cranbrook School in 1946, Harvard College in 1950 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1953. After law school, he worked as an associate lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a law firm in New York City, until 1962. His time at Cravath was interrupted for three and a half years when he served at the Pentagon in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps as a 1st Lieutenant. In 1962, he moved from New York back to Michigan to work as a lawyer for Ford Motor Company. He retired from Ford as Assistant General Counsel in 1990. Bill was fortunate to have married Gertrude Baldwin Perkins ""Kitty"", one of the fabulous identical Perkins Twins of Wilkes-Barre, PA. He was married to Kitty for 47 years until her death in 2006. He also outlived his younger sister, Jean Davenport Crawford, who died in 2002. Bill had a wonderful life. Those who knew him will remember his intelligence, charm, sense of humor and strong moral character, all of which are captured in his daughter Nina Davenport's HBO documentary ""First Comes Love"" (premiering on Netflix in November). Bill loved his time at Cranbrook, Harvard, and Michigan Law School. He spent his summers at his cottage in the Chicago Club of Charlevoix, Michigan where he had a close community of friends. After retirement, he and Kitty also rented a house every spring in Provence. Bill's favorite sports were cooking, 19th century English literature, vegetable gardening and the New York Times. After his wife Kitty died, he became an avid bridge player. He will be missed by his many bridge partners. Above all, he was a loving and devoted husband and father. Bill is survived by his three children, Kirk, Tim and Nina Davenport, and seven grandchildren: Lydia, Addison, Alexander, Eliza, Jackson, Lucas and Jasper. A memorial service in Bloomfield Hills is being planned for the weekend of November 14, 2015. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you consider a gift to The Davenport Family Scholarship Fund at the University of Michigan Law School, 701 S. State St., Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-3091.

2015-10-06T00:00:00Z,"SIEGEL--Rabbi Paul R.,who was the Senior Rabbi for Temple Beth Abraham in Tarrytown, NY for 43 years, died peacefully Sunday at Village Care in New York City. He was 91 years old. Rabbi Siegel was born in Baltimore, MD, on March 6, 1924, his parents recently having emigrated from Safed, Israel. In 1948 Rabbi Siegel was ordained by his teacher, friend and mentor, Rabbi Steven Wise at the Hebrew Union College, Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. That same year, he married Lorraine Peltz in a ceremony officiated by Rabbi Wise. In addition to receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science from Brooklyn College, Rabbi Siegel received a Masters Degree in Educational Psychology from Columbia University. Rabbi Siegel served as a chaplain in the Air Force during the Korean War, attaining the rank of Captain, and then began his long and distinguished career as the Rabbi for Temple Beth Abraham. During his tenure there, he led both conservative and reform services, in two different chapels within the same building, to honor tradition as well as innovation. Rabbi Siegel was in the vanguard of the Reform Jewish movement, having been instrumental in establishing interfaith services in Tarrytown and ensuring the equality of men and women in the synagogue. In 1976 Rabbi Siegel was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Divinity from Hebrew Union College. Rabbi Siegel was known for his kindness, generosity of spirit, keen intelligence and ability to skillfully yarn a story or joke to capture the meaning or absurdity of any conceivable situation. Rabbi Siegel is survived by his loving wife of 67 years, Dr. Lorraine Siegel, and his three children, Frederic Siegel of Briarcliff Manor, NY, Deborah Zoller of Allentown, PA, and Arthur Siegel of Albany, NY (his loving son, Joshua Siegel, having predeceased him). Also surviving are his grandchildren Evan, Jeremy, Matty, Mallory, Sarah Zoller Levinson and Rachel Zoller Lipsman. 1/3"

2015-10-06T00:00:00Z,"SIDNAM--Gloria, longtime New York City and Bedford resident, died on October 5th at home in Manhattan. Born in New York on 23 January 1937, Gloria was married to Joseph Ercolano in 1956, to Burt Wells in 1969, and to Alan Sidnam, the love of her life, in 1975. Art was the centerpiece of Gloria's life. She spent more than thirty years on the creative side of the advertising business in its heyday, working at Warwick & Legler, Grey Advertising, and finally Ogilvy & Mather, where she was Associate Creative Director when she retired. Starting in 1989 Gloria devoted a great part of her boundless energy to becoming an art history scholar and docent at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. Throughout her years at the Met, she studied constantly, continually expanding her knowledge base. She reveled in the details and loved inspiring her students. She was completely fluent on all aspects of the Met collection -- Greek, Roman, European, and American art, even Arms & Armor. Her free time was devoted to cultivating beauty in everything she touched, oil painting, visiting museums and art collections, but, perhaps most of all, to her many friends. She was surrounded by people whom she loved and who loved her dearly. In addition to those friends, Gloria is survived by her son Gregory Ercolano, her stepdaughter Caroline Sidnam, and her extended family. The time and place of a memorial gathering have not yet been determined. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to Northern Westchester Hospital and the Metropolitan Museum. 1/3"

2015-10-06T00:00:00Z,"HANFT--Edwin, 90, of Manhattan, New York, died on October 4, 2015. Even to his last days, Ed displayed the wit, wisdom, and unflagging humor with which he lived his life. He was born on October 31, 1924, to Max and Anna Hanft, and grew up in the tenements of New York's Lower East Side. At 17, he met the love of his life, Gladys Potash, at Kutsher's, a Catskills resort, where he was working as athletic director and where she was staying with her family nearby. The two began dating and, when Ed enlisted in the U.S. military to serve in World War II that fall, he wrote to Gladys nearly every single day during his time in the service. He served in the weather service of the military--one of many testaments to his utter brilliance and persuasive powers, because his knowledge of meteorology was largely self-taught in the libraries of New York City. After the war, he returned to City College and married Gladys. His love of words was cultivated there, where he was one of the founders of the Observation Post, City College's activist undergraduate newspaper, and majored in English. He went on to a successful career in advertising as a creative director and copywriter, with much of his career spent as principal and creative director of Chalk, Nissen, Hanft, Inc. One of his projects consisted of a pro bono campaign for the NAACP, portraying the harsh effects of continuing school segregation even after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. He garnered many awards for his advertising copy. Among Ed's numerous hobbies was harness racing, and he bred and raced harness horses, as owner of the Polysyllabic Grange (aptly named by him, with his characteristic irony). His sharp wit also continued into his retirement, on display in the humorous and biting letters to the editor he wrote to the many publications which he continued to read religiously, for as long as his eyesight allowed him. Ed was deeply loved by his soul mate and wife of more than 68 years, Gladys Hanft; his sons, Noah and Joshua Hanft; his daughters-in-law Dora Barlaz Hanft and Claudia Chernov; and his six grandchildren, Ali, Elizabeth, Genevieve, Paul, Gideon, and Eliezer Hanft.

2015-10-06T00:00:00Z,"BARRETT--Lucille, died October 4, 2015, at age 92. Lou was the matriarch of a large and grateful family. Lou Barrett was a poet, scholar, teacher and social activist. Her poetry appeared in Midstream, Connecticut River Review, Poetica magazine, Muse, Voices Israel, and the National English Journal. She was honored by the Connecticut Council of Teachers of English and the Connecticut Poetry Society for her work. Her publications include five collections of poetry that explore fearlessly and with intensity her Jewish heritage, her childhood in Brooklyn, and her maturing to adulthood and old age. Through all her writings, she found meaning in the connections between her own life and the symbols and images that have endured in myth, story, and literature throughout the centuries. Lou Barrett was a great teacher. She was a lifelong teacher in the classroom, transforming lives for decades of students. Beginning her teaching career in Greenwich Village in the 1940s, she later became a beloved teacher of English literature in the Westport Public Schools, where after retirement she continued as a writing coach. She shared her love of Jewish literature and scholarship with classes at Temple Israel in Westport, Connecticut and in Congregation Kol Ami in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, where she and her husband for 73 years, the late Herbert Barrett, lived in their later years. Lou was a teacher, not only in the classroom, but in the way she raised her family. She had the instinct great teachers have: to reach and connect with every student, every child and grandchild according to his or her own personality and passions. She believed in her students, her children, and her friends, and strove to help them see in themselves the strength and beauty she saw in them. She treated every one with honesty and respect. Lucille Barrett is survived by five children, David, Joshua, Sarah, George, and Daniel, ten grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be held Tuesday, October 6th, at 12:30pm at Temple Israel in Westport Connecticut, with private burial service to follow. The family will sit shiva after the burial at the home of Marvin and Joan Frimmer in Westport, CT. They will also be sitting shiva Wednesday, October 7th, from 5-8pm at the home of George Barrett and Debbie Neimeth, in Rydal, PA.

2015-10-07T00:00:00Z,"BARRETT--Lucille, died October 4, 2015, at age 92. Lou was the matriarch of a large and grateful family. Lou Barrett was a poet, scholar, teacher and social activist. Her poetry appeared in Midstream, Connecticut River Review, Poetica magazine, Muse, Voices Israel, and the National English Journal. She was honored by the Connecticut Council of Teachers of English and the Connecticut Poetry Society for her work. Her publications include five collections of poetry that explore fearlessly and with intensity her Jewish heritage, her childhood in Brooklyn, and her maturing to adulthood and old age. Through all her writings, she found meaning in the connections between her own life and the symbols and images that have endured in myth, story, and literature throughout the centuries. Lou Barrett was a great teacher. She was a lifelong teacher in the classroom, transforming lives for decades of students. Beginning her teaching career in Greenwich Village in the 1940s, she later became a beloved teacher of English literature in the Westport Public Schools, where after retirement she continued as a writing coach. She shared her love of Jewish literature and scholarship with classes at Temple Israel in Westport, Connecticut and in Congregation Kol Ami in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, where she and her husband for 73 years, the late Herbert Barrett, lived in their later years. Lou was a teacher, not only in the classroom, but in the way she raised her family. She had the instinct great teachers have: to reach and connect with every student, every child and grandchild according to his or her own personality and passions. She believed in her students, her children, and her friends, and strove to help them see in themselves the strength and beauty she saw in them. She treated every one with honesty and respect. Lucille Barrett is survived by five children, David, Joshua, Sarah, George, and Daniel, ten grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be held Tuesday, October 6th, at 12:30pm at Temple Israel in Westport Connecticut, with private burial service to follow. The family will sit shiva after the burial at the home of Marvin and Joan Frimmer in Westport, CT. They will also be sitting shiva Wednesday, October 7th, from 5-8pm at the home of George Barrett and Debbie Neimeth, in Rydal, PA.

Born in New York on 23 January 1937, Gloria was married to Joseph Ercolano in 1956, to Burt Wells in 1969, and to Alan Sidnam, the love of her life, in 1975. Art was the centerpiece of Gloria's life. She spent more than thirty years on the creative side of the advertising business in its heyday, working at Warwick & Legler, Grey Advertising, and finally Ogilvy & Mather, where she was Associate Creative Director when she retired. Starting in 1989 Gloria devoted a great part of her boundless energy to becoming an art history scholar and docent at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. Throughout her years at the Met, she studied constantly, continually expanding her knowledge base. She reveled in the details and loved inspiring her students. She was completely fluent on all aspects of the Met collection -- Greek, Roman, European, and American art, even Arms & Armor. Her free time was devoted to cultivating beauty in everything she touched, oil painting, visiting museums and art collections, but, perhaps most of all, to her many friends. She was surrounded by people whom she loved and who loved her dearly. In addition to those friends, Gloria is survived by her son Gregory Ercolano, her stepdaughter Caroline Sidnam, and her extended family.

2015-10-10T00:00:00Z,"GOLUB--Gerald. The Members, staff, and his fellow Advisors to TIGER 21 mourn the passing of Gerry Golub, our dear friend. Gerry was a most unusual man of humility, rare intelligence and deep courage. The courageous and determined manner in which he spoke about his approach to fighting Lymphoma for many years was an inspiration. He was always upbeat, and when he wasn't, you couldn't tell. Gerry started from modest beginnings, having walked five miles uphill to and from school every day. He founded Goldstein Golub and Kessler, which would go on to become the largest single office accounting firm in America, and then years later figured out how to structure a sale that broke new ground in his profession. Gerry was first and foremost a family man. He spoke mostly about his wife Bonnie, his children and grandchildren, and he partook in every triumph and challenge as if they were his own. His colleagues at TIGER 21 often shared in the joys of each college acceptance (and nursery school acceptance) that he so proudly shared. As an advisor and confidant, Gerry was unique. He seemed to have time to listen and provide thoughtful advice whenever he was called upon to do so. As the ""numbers man,"" Gerry was the one we all turned to for important perspective about whether we were seeing things correctly and understanding the importance of one trend or another. His power was rooted in his common sense; he understood people's motivations and how best to approach the endless challenges of growing a business. Gerry's professionalism, preparation and thoughtfulness really set the standard for all of us. Gerry was a disciplined man. In the 25 years in which he participated in monthly meetings with fellow Members, he was always the first to arrive and had the highest attendance record by far, something he was always proud of. Gerry was a role model. In his retirement he took on communal responsibilities for his local fire department, that he labored over, as if the challenges were his own. He cared that much. Mostly, he was a good man and a good friend, and his loss will be deep and long lasting. We extend our deepest sympathies to Gerry's wife, Bonnie, his children and grandchildren. We share your loss. We were honored to have counted Gerry as a good friend and a cherished advisor. Michael W. Sonnenfeldt TIGER 21 Founder and Chairman 1/3"

2015-10-11T00:00:00Z,"JOBE--Edward Blinn. November 24, 1929-October 4, 2015. Edward B. Jobe passed away unexpectedly but peacefully on Sunday, October 4, with Laura, his wife of 56 years, by his side. A man of honor and integrity, he was deeply loved by his family and friends and adored and respected by the many people whose paths he crossed over his long, successful business career. A native of Iowa, Ed spent over 50 years in the insurance industry. Following the highly successful management-led buyout from Aetna Life and Casualty in September 1992, he was named Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of American Re Corporation and American Re-Insurance Company where he spent 33 years of his career until his retirement in December of 1995. During Ed's tenure as CEO, American Re more than doubled in size and was one of the most profitable reinsurers in the U.S., positioning the company for its ultimate sale to Munich Re at among the highest multiples of book value ever experienced in the U.S. insurance industry. While proud of the financial results, Ed measured success by the many talented people he helped during his career and the deep client relationships he encouraged and nurtured, many of which are still in place today. Born November 24, 1929 in Keokuk, Iowa, Ed received many awards in his lifetime, but his greatest achievement was meeting the love of his life, Laura (Halvorson) Jobe, while calling on her family's bank in St. Ansgar, Iowa. A five year courtship led to a long and loving marriage filled with laughter. They had a unique marriage contract which every year could either be renewed or dissolved, with no hard feelings. The last contract was renewed on February 21, 2015. Including his wife Laura, Ed is survived by his devoted daughter Trudy Queripel, her husband Jeffrey, Trudy's three children, Stephen, Laura and John Deckoff, his brother Wayne (Shirley), sisters Janis McBain (George) and Jerilyn Mason (Roger) and his beloved dog, Molly.

Stubing, who served as President for 21 years. His warmth, generosity, interest in others, graciousness, understated humor, elegant writing, humility, intellectual curiosity, wide artistic interests, and skills as a raconteur and host will continue to inspire us and many others whose lives he touched. His intellectual and artistic interests were as broad as the good works and his impact on many people and institutions. He enthusiastically shared his deep knowledge of the history, religion, architecture, and the arts scene of New York City. A deeply religious person, he had one eye on heaven and one fixed solidly on earth and was often called upon when family and friends needed someone in whom they could confide and seek counsel. His vision enabled Greenwall to have extraordinary national impact for a relatively small foundation, becoming the main funder of bioethics research in the United States. Under his leadership, the Foundation was willing to be bold and take risks in supporting potentially controversial areas of inquiry. The Foundation also supported emerging arts in New York City, supporting creative accomplishments in the fine and the performing arts. He led the board to focus on supporting gifted young bioethics scholars through career development awards, establishing the Greenwall Faculty Scholars Program. Many awardees have become leaders in bioethics. His suggestions and encouragement contributed to the success of many grantees and enriching their lives. Born September 28, 1939, he was educated at Concordia Senior College and graduated from Concordia Seminary. He earned his Masters at the New York University School of Education. Before the Greenwall Foundation, he served as a priest and worked at the American Medical Association and then the New York Academy of Medicine, as Director of the Academy, the first and only non-physician to hold that position. He worked with board members to modernize the structure of the Academy. We extend our deepest condolences to his beloved partner of thirty-seven years and husband, Ronald Thomas, who survives him.

Gerry was a most unusual man of humility, rare intelligence and deep courage. The courageous and determined manner in which he spoke about his approach to fighting Lymphoma for many years was an inspiration. He was always upbeat, and when he wasn't, you couldn't tell. Gerry started from modest beginnings, having walked five miles uphill to and from school every day. He founded Goldstein Golub and Kessler, which would go on to become the largest single office accounting firm in America, and then years later figured out how to structure a sale that broke new ground in his profession. Gerry was first and foremost a family man. He spoke mostly about his wife Bonnie, his children and grandchildren, and he partook in every triumph and challenge as if they were his own. His colleagues at TIGER 21 often shared in the joys of each college acceptance (and nursery school acceptance) that he so proudly shared. As an advisor and confidant, Gerry was unique. He seemed to have time to listen and provide thoughtful advice whenever he was called upon to do so. As the ""numbers man,"" Gerry was the one we all turned to for important perspective about whether we were seeing things correctly and understanding the importance of one trend or another. His power was rooted in his common sense; he understood people's motivations and how best to approach the endless challenges of growing a business. Gerry's professionalism, preparation and thoughtfulness really set the standard for all of us. Gerry was a disciplined man. In the 25 years in which he participated in monthly meetings with fellow Members, he was always the first to arrive and had the highest attendance record by far, something he was always proud of. Gerry was a role model. In his retirement he took on communal responsibilities for his local fire department, that he labored over, as if the challenges were his own. He cared that much. Mostly, he was a good man and a good friend, and his loss will be deep and long lasting. We extend our deepest sympathies to Gerry's wife, Bonnie, his children and grandchildren. We share your loss.

2015-10-11T00:00:00Z,"STARR--Alice Marcelle Paule, (nee Casanova). Passed away peacefully in her sleep on October 3, 2015. Alice paved her own way through the world - traveling, learning languages, and integrating herself into the life and culture of many countries. Born in Constantine, Algeria on August 3, 1921, during the French colonial era, Alice developed an appreciation for science, music, and, most of all, languages. Her favorite story was how she made herself indispensable to the American servicemen stationed in North Africa during World War II with her grasp of not only the English language, but also American slang, French and Arabic. It was there that she met her husband of 29 years, Warrant Officer Joseph Rankin Starr. Three sons were born in quick succession after the War, and the family followed her husband's career to Germany, the United States, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, and Panama, ending up in New York in 1964 when her husband joined the United Nations civil service. Alice worked teaching French and translating for luminaries such as Josephine Baker and eminent institutions such as the United Nations. She maintained active involvement in city life, with memberships to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Explorer's Club, and The Alliance Francaise and played a key role in the operation and management of her Upper East Side co-op. Alice is survived by her three sons, Paul, Robert, and Gerald Starr, five grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren. 1/3"

Life’s pretty great for Pepper, a fluff-ball gray house cat who has eyes like lime-green saucers and firm personal boundaries. Then his owner gives him a young companion, and it all goes south.

2015-10-14T00:00:00Z,"BERMINGHAM-FOX--Carol. Loving mother of Sarah Bermingham and beloved wife of Colin Fox, died peacefully at home on the evening of October 8th following a long arduous partnership with a rare and deadly cancer. Born in Hamilton, Ontario, a graduate of the University of Toronto, Carol moved to New York to pursue a career in mental health. It was there that she married John Bermingham, father of Sarah, enrolled at New York University and graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science. She earned her MSc from Columbia University and gained experience in the field of mental health at the Psychiatric Institute. As a psychiatric nurse clinician she joined the team at Mount Sinai Hospital, during which time her marriage ended. Carol reunited with Colin (having met him many years before) and they were married in New York in 1986. They eventually returned to Canada in 1989, but within a year she was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Surviving surgery she went on to teach at Ryerson University in Toronto and to act as an administrator at The Homewood Health Centre in Guelph, Ontario. Aside from her career in medicine, she was a great lover of the arts, particularly opera, which she learned at her grandfather's knee. That love of the arts was enhanced by a stay in Rome, during which Colin was involved in a film, and the eternal city became her spiritual home. Mementos of her Italian sojourn fill the house that she has so beautifully decorated. Carol always downplayed her accomplishments. Rather, she championed the struggles of those whose lives were circumscribed by mental illness and poverty. When she worked in New York she was held in high esteem by her colleagues at Mount Sinai, some of whom have become lifelong friends. Her cancer seemed to be in remission but after 21 years it recurred and it was found to have spread. As with the many setbacks she encountered in her life, Carol faced this one with remarkable resilience and courage. In 2011, when she was given only six months to live, Carol refused to succumb to fear, pursuing her love of travel, art, and music and spent two winters in Rome, beating the odds by four and a half years. Facing the end, she decided that she wanted to die at home. Her wish was fulfilled all too soon. Greatly loved by Colin and Sarah, her family and friends, Carol has left an indelible mark and an empty place in our lives. Visitation will be held at the family home, located at 37 Henderson Street in Elora, Ontario, on Friday, October 16th, 2015 between the hours of 3pm and 7pm. Funeral Service for Carol will be conducted at St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church, at the corner of Henderson and Smith Streets in Elora, Ontario, on Saturday, October 17th, 2015 at 3:30pm. In lieu of flowers, please make donations to the St. Francis Table Capuchin Outreach to the Poor (www.capuchinoutreach.org) or the St. John's Elora Choir Fund (stjohns@sentex.net). 1/3"

Jamie tackled his physical and intellectual challenges with courage, determination and humor well beyond his years. He was a warrior of the heart who witnessed and stimulated a generation of improvement in the lives of persons with intellectual disabilities. Without words, he powerfully advocated by gentle presence. Without sight, he stimulated the vision of policymakers. Without being able to stand or walk, he motivated others to stand firm for the dignity, safety and inclusion of his disabled peers with all citizens in the fundamental amenities and protections of community life. He surprised countless skeptics touched by his vulnerability into an awareness that true beneficiaries of inclusion are not those allowed inside, but those who let go of the need to keep others out. He taught us to see the real person in each human regardless of how clothed in wealth, race, ethnicity, personal preference or ability. He reminded us that love always trumps accomplishment. Jamie is survived by his admiring and adoring immediate family, Sara, David and Liza, grandparents Jack and Jeanne Blum, a platoon of supportive aunts and uncles, and their children who always found room for cousin Jamie among their ranks. Jamie enters freedom from pain and the company of his predeceased mischievous brother, Sam, and his grandparents, Hamilton Hadden, Sally Hadden and Susanne Blum. Visiting hours will be held from 4pm to 7pm at Taylor & Modeen, 136 South Main Street, West Hartford, CT on Thursday, October 15, 2015.

Jamie tackled his physical and intellectual challenges with courage, determination and humor well beyond his years. He was a warrior of the heart who witnessed and stimulated a generation of improvement in the lives of persons with intellectual disabilities. Without words, he powerfully advocated by gentle presence. Without sight, he stimulated the vision of policymakers. Without being able to stand or walk, he motivated others to stand firm for the dignity, safety and inclusion of his disabled peers with all citizens in the fundamental amenities and protections of community life. He surprised countless skeptics touched by his vulnerability into an awareness that true beneficiaries of inclusion are not those allowed inside, but those who let go of the need to keep others out. He taught us to see the real person in each human regardless of how clothed in wealth, race, ethnicity, personal preference or ability. He reminded us that love always trumps accomplishment. Jamie is survived by his admiring and adoring immediate family, Sara, David and Liza, grandparents Jack and Jeanne Blum, a platoon of supportive aunts and uncles, and their children who always found room for cousin Jamie among their ranks. Jamie enters freedom from pain and the company of his predeceased mischievous brother, Sam, and his grandparents, Hamilton Hadden, Sally Hadden and Susanne Blum.

2015-10-15T00:00:00Z,"NEWHOUSE--Susan Marley. Today an extended community celebrates the life of Susan Marley Newhouse, who died August 13, 2015, in New York City. Wellesley College joins this community in mourning the loss and honoring the life of a distinguished alumna and philanthropist. She will long be remembered for her devotion to the College, her passion for the arts and humanities, her unwavering service, and her extraordinary generosity. Sue earned an English degree from Wellesley in 1955 at age 19, the same year she met her future husband, Donald Newhouse. Sue's love for her alma mater was infectious, and the impact of the Newhouse family's enduring generosity to Wellesley cannot be overstated. The Newhouses have supported Wellesley's financial aid programs, Wellesley Centers for Women, and many other initiatives. In 2004, a major gift established The Susan and Donald Newhouse Center for the Humanities at Wellesley, which promotes innovative, imaginative, and influential research in the humanities and creates opportunities for intellectual risk-taking and the lively exchange of ideas. This vibrant hub unites the College across disciplines and hosts visiting and resident scholars, artists, and performers. The first director of the Susan and Donald Newhouse Center for the Humanities, 1949 Professor of Ethics and Professor of English Tim Peltason, sums up the community's sentiments: ""I remember best about Susan her exceptional kindness and good cheer, [and] the sense that it gave her genuine and disinterested delight to see the good effects of her generosity. She was always... eagerly curious about the intellectual life of the College."" Susan Newhouse supported Wellesley in many ways, including as a trustee of the College and as co-chair of the capital campaign in 2005 that set new records for fundraising by a liberal arts college. Wellesley was one of many recipients of Susan Newhouse's time and talents. Memories of her warmth and positivity will be cherished by those who knew her personally and by countless more whose lives have been transformed by her vision and action. Our hearts go out to husband Don, children Kathy, Michael, and Steven, and all Sue's grandchildren and extended family. The struggle with illness at the end of her life does not dim the bright light she shone on us all. Chair of the Wellesley College Board of Trustees Laura Daignault Gates, President H. Kim Bottomly, and Provost Andrew Shennan. 1/3"

This firm became the foremost tenant-oriented commercial real estate firm in New York and later in major cities throughout the United States. Julien became widely-known as a thoughtful and valued advisor to commercial tenants on all real estate matters and was highly respected by his colleagues and clients. However, his passion for life extended well beyond his professional duties. Julien was also a leader in the philanthropic community in New York, serving as Chairman of the New School for Social Research, from which he received the Distinguished Service Award in 1997. He was also the Chairman of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, and served as a significant member of the Boards of Lincoln Center and The Graduate School of CUNY. All those who were privileged to know him will miss his friendship, compassion, wisdom, and readiness to help others. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son Jacob, his sister-in-law Helen Studley, his stepson Ni jun and Ni jun's wife LuLu, and his beloved step-grandchildren Adam and Benjamin. Funeral services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York City on October 16, at 10:00am. Burial will follow at The Kensico Cemetery, 273 Lakeview Avenue, Valhalla, New York. Donations in Julien's memory may be made to the New School or to any charity of your choice. 1/3"

2015-10-15T00:00:00Z,"STUDLEY--Julien. We, the Board of Directors of Savills Studley, profoundly mourn the recent death of our former colleague and friend, Julien Studley. As founder of Julien J. Studley, Inc. in 1954, his innovative and visionary approach of representing tenants rather than owners was groundbreaking, changing the commercial real estate industry forever. As a broker, Julien advocated tenaciously for his clients--a trait that remains in the DNA of our firm's culture today. As a leader, he supported creativity, collaboration and, yes, a little healthy competition, inspiring people from all walks of life to be the best they could be. Those of us who were brought into the business by Julien are personally grateful to him for his encouragement and support. We, and indeed the entire industry, would not be where we are today if it were not for him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Jane and his children and grandchildren. Julien's contributions to the industry and to New York City will not be forgotten. 1/3"

2015-10-16T00:00:00Z,"WEISS--Irma Giustino. Died peacefully on October 6, 2015 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. This extraordinary woman was 96 years old. She was born on March 30, 1919 in New York City where she lived all of her long, productive life. She was a 1945 graduate of the School of Art at The Cooper Union, to which she was a devoted and generous alumna, establishing the Irma Giustino Weiss Scholarships for meritorious students in art and architecture and the IGW Cultural Enrichment Fellowship Program. The latter was particularly close to Irma's heart, as it provided students with the financial means to experience the unique artistic, theatrical and cultural treasures of New York City. The other favorite object of her substantial philanthropy was the Whitney Museum, to which she was a major donor, contributing at the highest levels, primarily towards the new building. She had a successful career and marriage. Irma was the first female hired in the Art Department of Triangle Publications, later received two Art Director Awards for her work at Ziff Davis Publishing, and ultimately became a Creative Director at Conde Nast Publications. She married Benjamin Weiss in 1969, and he predeceased her on October 23, 1992. It was a magical marriage, whose romance never ended. A building at Rockefeller University is named for them. She was a woman of style, an exceptional cook, highly intelligent, witty and a ""liberal"" in the best sense of the word. She deeply cared about human rights. Right up to her death, she was a yeasayer to life, going at it full blast, benefitting always from her most treasured virtue, her curiosity. In due course, a memorial service will be held in her honor. 1/3"

She was born on March 30, 1919 in New York City where she lived all of her long, productive life. She was a 1945 graduate of the School of Art at The Cooper Union, to which she was a devoted and generous alumna, establishing the Irma Giustino Weiss Scholarships for meritorious students in art and architecture and the IGW Cultural Enrichment Fellowship Program. The latter was particularly close to Irma's heart, as it provided students with the financial means to experience the unique artistic, theatrical and cultural treasures of New York City. The other favorite object of her substantial philanthropy was the Whitney Museum, to which she was a major donor, contributing at the highest levels, primarily towards the new building. She had a successful career and marriage. Irma was the first female hired in the Art Department of Triangle Publications, later received two Art Director Awards for her work at Ziff Davis Publishing, and ultimately became a Creative Director at Conde Nast Publications. She married Benjamin Weiss in 1969, and he predeceased her on October 23, 1992. It was a magical marriage, whose romance never ended. A building at Rockefeller University is named for them. She was a woman of style, an exceptional cook, highly intelligent, witty and a ""liberal"" in the best sense of the word. She deeply cared about human rights. Right up to her death, she was a yeasayer to life, going at it full blast, benefitting always from her most treasured virtue, her curiosity. In due course, a memorial service will be held in her honor. 1/3"

She was born on March 30, 1919 in New York City where she lived all of her long, productive life. She was a 1945 graduate of the School of Art at The Cooper Union, to which she was a devoted and generous alumna, establishing the Irma Giustino Weiss Scholarships for meritorious students in art and architecture and the IGW Cultural Enrichment Fellowship Program. The latter was particularly close to Irma's heart, as it provided students with the financial means to experience the unique artistic, theatrical and cultural treasures of New York City. The other favorite object of her substantial philanthropy was the Whitney Museum, to which she was a major donor, contributing at the highest levels, primarily towards the new building. She had a successful career and marriage. Irma was the first female hired in the Art Department of Triangle Publications, later received two Art Director Awards for her work at Ziff Davis Publishing, and ultimately became a Creative Director at Conde Nast Publications. She married Benjamin Weiss in 1969, and he predeceased her on October 23, 1992. It was a magical marriage, whose romance never ended. A building at Rockefeller University is named for them. She was a woman of style, an exceptional cook, highly intelligent, witty and a ""liberal"" in the best sense of the word. She deeply cared about human rights.

Mrs. Ogilvie was born in New York City on January 21, 1910, to Ida and Donald Brace. Mr. Brace was cofounder of the publishing company, Harcourt Brace, in New York. Mrs. Ogilvie was a Director of Harcourt Brace & Co. and was honored for her service in 1960. Mrs. Ogilvie was a very generous and much admired philanthropist, supporting many causes, most notably the Stamford Hospital, Girls Inc., and Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Mass, from which she graduated in 1930. For many years, starting in the late 1940's, she volunteered her time at Stamford Hospital, accumulating over 9,000 volunteer hours in her lifetime. She has served as Trustee of the Hospital, Director of the Hospital Foundation and President of the Auxiliary. She made many important financial gifts to the hospital, donating the Brace Auditorium in the hospital in honor of her father, the Donna Brace Ogilvie Auditorium at the Tully Health Center and the establishment of the upcoming Donna Brace Ogilvie Volunteer Resource Center in the expanded hospital. She was honored at a special dinner in May of 2015 for her generosity to the hospital over the years, where it was stated that other than the founding benefactor of the hospital, ""no single individual has played a more important role in the history of Stamford Hospital."" She served on the board of the Stamford Girls Club during the 50's and 60's. She also served as Chair of the national board of Girls, Inc., based in New York City, for many years and at her death was still active as Distinguished Board Chair as well as serving on the board of the local Girls Inc. chapter in Sarasota, FL. The Sarasota center was recently renamed in her honor. Her gifts to Andover Academy were many, including the Brace Center for Gender Studies in 1996. According to the school, ""Ogilvie is known as the most prominent female benefactor in the history of the school."" In 1997, Andover bestowed on her its highest honor, the Claude Moore Fuess Award. Her active philanthropic life earned her many other awards, honors and friendships that sustained her until her death. She was predeceased by her parents and her sister, Katharine Brace Cummings and three husbands, John Ralph Latham, Louis Francis Kroeck and Dr. John Black Ogilvie, a well- known surgeon practicing in Stamford. She had three children: John Brace Latham, who predeceased her.

2015-10-18T00:00:00Z,"GAFFNEY--Loti Falk, 94, died at home on October 13, peacefully and comfortably, surrounded by loving family and her devoted caregivers, Ana Kruppenbacher and Michelle Wilson. Loti grew up in fortunate circumstances. Born in Istanbul, she spent her childhood and teenage years in Milan and St. Moritz, where she compounded her native fluency in Italian and French with working knowledge of the other major European languages. Despite the strictness and formality of her upbringing, she was permitted to go to Paris to study philosophy at the Sorbonne, acquiring a body of knowledge that would prove significant in her social and political views later in life. Loti and her family came to New York in the late 1930s and Loti plunged into the life of the city, learning English, taking courses at Columbia and, when the war finally came to America, performing volunteer service. Along the way, she fell in love with Michael A. Gerard, a US Army lieutenant, who was to command a tank battalion in the European Theatre. Loti and Mike had two sons, Robert and Peter, who survive her today. After her marriage to Mike ended in divorce in the 1950s, Loti was determined to give her sons the advantages she enjoyed as a child. To supplement her income, she took two jobs. She was an instructor in Italian and French at Berlitz School of Languages (a remarkable feat since Berlitz limited its faculty to native speakers). In addition, she became quite proficient and prominent in providing scripts for dubbing Italian films into English: the challenge of matching up lip movements to words in another language. Among her many credits were Fellini's 8-1/2, Divorce Italian Style, The Seven Capital Sins, L'Aventura and Rocco and his Brothers. In 1963, Loti married Leon Falk, Jr., of Pittsburgh, a leading philanthropist and industrialist, taking on, among other things, eight new stepchildren and a number of step-grandchildren, a daunting, but rewarding, task for a woman barely in her 40s. Almost immediately, she became a powerful force in the Pittsburgh cultural community, taking positions on the boards of all the major cultural organizations, reviving the nearly moribund Pittsburgh Playhouse and, her most cherished accomplishment, turning the Pittsburgh Ballet from a small local company to a recognized national and international force in ballet, a position it continues to hold today. Loti's contributions were far more than financial. She had a deep sense of and appreciation for beauty in many forms of artistic expression-music, dance, painting, sculpture-enhanced by outstanding organizational and leadership skills, all implemented by a powerful commitment to getting things done right. Leon was also a prominent cattle breeder, operating Falklands Farm in the Allegheny Mountains east of Pittsburgh, producing prizewinning Polled Hereford cattle. Loti was a city girl, but she plunged into country life with the same intensity she devoted to everything else. She developed and nurtured a large, year round, organic garden at a time when organic was a term associated with chemistry or music, but certainly not food. The farm and its products were to be a central part of Loti's life for a long time: a place to appreciate nature and a place to share with her grandchildren. After Leon's passing in 1988, Loti, while maintaining her commitments in Pittsburgh, began to spend more of her time at her pied a terre in New York and traveling in Europe. In 1993, she married Frank Gaffney, a prominent Pittsburgh attorney and a fellow board member of the Pittsburgh Symphony. Her marriage to Frank added three more stepchildren to her ranks. Soon thereafter, Loti acquired a home in the Tuscan countryside, south of Florence and she and Frank began an idyllic life in the land of her youth, speaking her native language, cultivating an olive grove and making (and selling) their own brand of olive oil, making many new Italian friends, and, above all, sharing with her frequently visiting family the joys she loved as a child. With Frank's untimely passing in November 2001, shortly after the tragedy of 9/11, Loti knew the time had come to return home, and settled back in New York. As she moved into her mid-80s, her commitment to culture and her family remained robust: she joined the Board of the Martha Graham Dance Company, she volunteered at the Little Red Schoolhouse-Elisabeth Irwin High School and the Rubin Museum of Art. In recent years, as age has slowed her, she has stayed closer to home, spending time with her sons Robert and Peter and their wives Pippa and Melinda, as well as her grandchildren, Celia Gerard and her partner Mark McGrath of New York, Robert Gerard and his wife Cara of Sonoma, CA, William Gerard and his wife Libby of Oakland, CA, Jennifer Gerard of Los Angeles and Wylie and Ben Johnston of New York, and four great grandchildren: Chloe and Kellen (Robert) and Lucy and Emmy (William). She also remained devoted to her 11 stepsons and daughters (and their children and grandchildren) from her marriages to Leon and Frank and to her cousins, nieces and nephews throughout the world. Loti's final act of generosity was the donation of her body to medical research and, at her express wish, there will be no funeral or memorial service. Those wishing to commemorate her life may make gifts in her name to a charity of their choice or perform a simple act of kindness. 1/3"

2015-10-18T00:00:00Z,"HOLMES--Elisabeth. Elisabeth Nicholson Holmes, known as Robin, and Mummy, Baas or AuntieBaas to the younger generations, died on Monday evening October 12th. She had been bravely fighting ALS which was diagnosed on her 79th birthday on January 26th of this year. Robin was born Elisabeth Blair Nicholson in 1936 in Roslyn, New York. She attended the Green Vale School in Locust Valley, NY,; St. Michael's in Newport, RI and graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT to which she remained devoted throughout her life. Robin met her husband, Col. Frederick S. Holmes Jr. (Freddy) who survives her, at a clambake at Second Beach in Middletown, RI when they were both teenagers. When she made her debut in Newport in 1954, Freddy made sure to secure an invitation to the party after which they began dating. They were married there at ages 20 and 21 in 1956 in the chapel of Freddy's alma mater, St. George's School, shortly after Freddy's graduation from West Point. Son Freddy 3rd arrived in 1957 when they were stationed in Stuttgart Germany and later, daughter Susan in 1960 in Massachusetts where Freddy was getting his first of two degrees from MIT. As a military family, they moved many times in the first 17 years of marriage before settling in Annandale, VA in 1973 when Freddy worked at the Pentagon. Robin had many varied interests, notably gardening, both in Virginia and at their summer home in Eagles Mere, PA; needlepoint, knitting, reading, world affairs and perhaps most famously, the British Royal Family about which she could tell you everything. She was knowledgeable about all European history and the history of art. She was an excellent public speaker. She worked extensively as a volunteer for the American Red Cross for many years in Blood Services, counseling, and disaster services, attaining the rank of Deputy National Director of Volunteers at National Headquarters in Washington. She was a Daughter of the American Revolution. When she was in her 50s she got her first- ever paying job with the NFCU. She made many friends there from many different countries and all walks of life. Everyone there who got married got a plant from one of Robin's cuttings as a gift and every baby born got something hand-knitted. She volunteered with after-school programs for years, tutoring grade-school children. This was a calling she loved before she had to give it up as her speech became impaired. She made friends wherever she went, always showing an interest in other people. She never met a cab driver who's life story she hadn't learned before it was time to pay her fare. She is survived by her husband Freddy, children Freddy 3 and Susan, their spouses, Kathy Holmes and Matt Heller, three grandchildren, Helen and Caroline Holmes and Nathaniel Heller, and Brian Aguirre, Helen's husband. She leaves behind many friends of all ages who will miss her always sunny, upbeat disposition, warmth and kindness.

Beloved husband, dearest friend and love of Patricia Ross Weis for 57 happy years; dearly loved father of Jennifer Ross Weis Monsky, Colleen Ross Weis, and Jonathan Harry Goldman Ross Weis; proud fatherin-law of John R. Monsky, Martin Laiks, and Analisa Barreto Weis; adoring and lucky grandfather of Harrison Weis Monsky, Annabel Weis Monsky, Gillian Stella Weis Monsky, Caitlin May Weis Monsky, Jacob Ross Barreto Weis, Dayssi Francesca Barreto Weis, and Felix Emanuel Barreto Weis, Allison Weis Laiks and Lara Frances Weis Laiks. He leaves a sister, Ellen Wasserman of Baltimore. Robert's family meant everything to him, and he meant everything to them. There was no one more adored for his enduring support of their endeavors and their own choices. It is hard to express how much he will be missed. Mr. Weis attended Mercersburg Academy and Yale University, class of 1941, following which, he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He was subsequently assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force officer training program, ultimately attaining the rank of captain. A leader in the supermarket industry, Robert started young --packing groceries and delivering them in a little red cart. He learned from his father, Harry Weis, who had founded the chain that he would run. He always remained loyal to his hometown, Sunbury, where Weis Markets is located, and it was his dedication to the company and leadership that preserved more than 18,300 jobs in 165 stores across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia and Maryland. He went to work every day until he was 95 with enthusiasm and high regard for all his associates. Mr. Weis was an active philanthropist. He and his wife have supported a number of major philanthropic projects and causes, including: Bard College, where Mrs. Weis is on the board of trustees; Franklin and Marshall College where they established the Robert F. and Patricia G. Ross Weis Professorship in Judaic Studies and the Weis College House; Susquehanna University, where they helped establish the Blough-Weis Library and the Stella Freeman Weis Cultural Endowment; the Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation of Boston; the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; and Sunbury Community Hospital during its non- profit years. Mr. and Mrs. Weis also helped establish the Department of Judaic Studies at Yale University, endowing a professorship for this department. Additionally, they supported the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale. Mr. Weis was a Sterling Fellow at Yale. After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Mr. Weis sponsored a flight of Jewish survivors who emigrated to Israel. Mr. Weis was also a longtime supporter of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) and was treasurer of UJA's Sunbury chapter for 55 years. Throughout his life, Mr. Weis was a strong supporter of Israel and once accompanied former Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Meir, on a helicopter flight over the Sinai Desert. Mr. Weis was a longtime member of Congregation Beth-El in Sunbury and was the major donor to the construction of the new synagogue. Mr. Weis was generous to many causes and to friends in need. He will always be cherished. Funeral Services, 1:30pm, Wednesday, October 21, at Congregation Beth-El, 249 Arch St. in Sunbury, PA.

2015-10-22T00:00:00Z,"WEIS--Robert Freeman, of Sunbury, PA. Born on June 10, 1919, he died on October 19th, 2015 in NYC. Beloved husband, dearest friend and love of Patricia Ross Weis for 57 happy years; dearly loved father of Jennifer Ross Weis Monsky, Colleen Ross Weis, and Jonathan Harry Goldman Ross Weis; proud fatherin-law of John R. Monsky, Martin Laiks, and Analisa Barreto Weis; adoring and lucky grandfather of Harrison Weis Monsky, Annabel Weis Monsky, Gillian Stella Weis Monsky, Caitlin May Weis Monsky, Jacob Ross Barreto Weis, Dayssi Francesca Barreto Weis, and Felix Emanuel Barreto Weis, Allison Weis Laiks and Lara Frances Weis Laiks. He leaves a sister, Ellen Wasserman of Baltimore. Robert's family meant everything to him, and he meant everything to them. There was no one more adored for his enduring support of their endeavors and their own choices. It is hard to express how much he will be missed. Mr. Weis attended Mercersburg Academy and Yale University, class of 1941, following which, he was drafted into the U.S. Army. He was subsequently assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force officer training program, ultimately attaining the rank of captain. A leader in the supermarket industry, Robert started young --packing groceries and delivering them in a little red cart. He learned from his father, Harry Weis, who had founded the chain that he would run. He always remained loyal to his hometown, Sunbury, where Weis Markets is located, and it was his dedication to the company and leadership that preserved more than 18,300 jobs in 165 stores across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia and Maryland. He went to work every day until he was 95 with enthusiasm and high regard for all his associates. Mr. Weis was an active philanthropist. He and his wife have supported a number of major philanthropic projects and causes, including: Bard College, where Mrs. Weis is on the board of trustees; Franklin and Marshall College where they established the Robert F. and Patricia G. Ross Weis Professorship in Judaic Studies and the Weis College House; Susquehanna University, where they helped establish the Blough-Weis Library and the Stella Freeman Weis Cultural Endowment; the Lown Cardiovascular Research Foundation of Boston; the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; and Sunbury Community Hospital during its non- profit years. Mr. and Mrs. Weis also helped establish the Department of Judaic Studies at Yale University, endowing a professorship for this department. Additionally, they supported the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale. Mr. Weis was a Sterling Fellow at Yale. After the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Mr. Weis sponsored a flight of Jewish survivors who emigrated to Israel. Mr. Weis was also a longtime supporter of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) and was treasurer of UJA's Sunbury chapter for 55 years. Throughout his life, Mr. Weis was a strong supporter of Israel and once accompanied former Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Meir, on a helicopter flight over the Sinai Desert. Mr. Weis was a longtime member of Congregation Beth-El in Sunbury and was the major donor to the construction of the new synagogue. Mr. Weis was generous to many causes and to friends in need. He will always be cherished. Funeral Services, 1:30pm, Wednesday, October 21, at Congregation Beth-El, 249 Arch St. in Sunbury, PA. Shiva, 7pm on Wednesday and 12-9pm on Thursday at the Weis home in Sunbury, PA. Shiva will be held in NYC at the Weis home, 7-9pm Saturday, 12-9pm Sunday and 12-9pm Monday. 1/3"

Randy was a former chair of our Litigation Department and Antitrust Practice Group and ably served clients and the pro bono community for almost 50 years. He worked on a variety of high-profile, precedent-setting cases throughout his career across a variety of industries. Clients and colleagues at the bench and bar all recognized Randy for the highly strategic, brilliant brief writer and tireless perfectionist he was. Continuing the tradition of great lawyers who view the law as a profession, not a job, Randy was a talented and creative litigator and problem solver who contributed to the development of several important areas of the law and provided the underserved with access to justice. In the last year alone, pro bono causes he helped champion include his work in securing a nationwide settlement in one of the largest series of labor trafficking cases in United States history, and still ongoing efforts in conjunction with the Brennan Center for Justice to preserve an independent judiciary in the state of Kansas. As devoted as he was to clients - ever ready to leap to their aid when they needed it - Randy was also a dedicated family man. We express our deep condolences to his wife Joan; his daughters Elissa Brachfeld and Stephanie Sherman Cronan (Chris); grandchildren Maddie and Daryn Brachfeld and Emma, Sophie and Tyler Cronan; sister Caroline Simon (Jeff); and mother Selma. A life richly blessed with family, friends and grounded in the ethos of loyalty, commitment and calling, Randy contributed invaluable leadership and wisdom to everyone in his orbit. He will continue to inspire all who knew him for generations. 1/3"

2015-10-25T00:00:00Z,"BUTTNER--Edgar, MD, PhD. It is with deep sadness that we announce that Edgar ""Ned"" Buttner, MD, PhD, a gifted researcher and generous colleague, passed away on October 15, 2015, after a valiant battle with leukemia and its consequences. He was 53. Dr. Buttner was the Director of the Pharmacogenomics Section of the Molecular Pharmacology Laboratory and, subsequently, Director of the Neurogenomics Laboratory in the Program for Neuropsychiatric Research at McLean Hospital. With a keen interest in helping others, Dr. Buttner dedicated his career, using a C. elegans model system, to investigating psychoses and neurodegenerative disorders and, especially, the effects that a variety of antipsychotic medications and genes related to illness have on brain function and behavior. His novel work implicated previously unknown molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of antipsychotic drugs. He had recently implemented new studies of the biological pathways that lead to ALS and other late life nervous system impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease. These findings may eventually lead to the development of new and more effective interventions to prevent or treat brain disorders. ""Ned Buttner was an exemplary and deeply valued friend and colleague,"" said Bruce M. Cohen, MD, PhD, director of the Program for Neuropsychiatric Research and the Robertson-Steele Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ""He was an outstanding scientist, who successfully applied an innovative system to identify the causes of illness and new modes of treatment. He was an exceptionally decent and caring man, beloved by his staff, his co-investigators, and his family. His passing, especially in the midst of such an active life and career, is a great loss."" In addition to his research, Dr. Buttner actively participated in neurology rounds at McLean and served as a mentor to a number of postdoctoral researchers within the Neurogenomics Laboratory. During his career, his work garnered several awards including the Augustus S. Rose Award for Excellence in Teaching at UCLA and Brain & Behavior Research Foundation Young Investigator Awards. Dr. Buttner earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College and both his PhD and MD from Columbia University Presbyterian Medical Center. He completed his residency in neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. Prior to joining the McLean staff, Dr. Buttner was a Postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also a Research Associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School (with Dr. Francine Benes) and a Research Associate in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University (with Dr. C.P. Hunter). Following these positions, he was most recently an Instructor in Psychiatry (Neuropsychiatry) at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Buttner was an Eagle Scout and remained an accomplished athlete throughout his life. He was a skier, a member of several ultimate Frisbee teams, a marathon runner, a hiker and a black belt in the martial arts. He was deeply loved by friends and family alike for his infectious laugh and his ability to listen carefully and render exceedingly thoughtful, well-balanced, consistently loving comments, as well as for his devotion to those in his care and employ. Dr. Buttner is survived by his parents, two sisters, his wife and his three children. His five year old daughter paid him the highest compliment last week saying, ""Daddy always spoke so kindly."" 1/3"

Sinai Hospital from 1953 until he retired as an assistant clinical professor. Dr. Yarosh built a prodigious dental practice.

2015-10-25T00:00:00Z,"BRODMAN--Dr. L. Elizabeth B. November 23, 1918 - October 19, 2015. Adored mother, spouse and sister, compassionate and ground breaking physician, died at home in Stamford, Connecticut, early in the morning on October 19, 2015, having gracefully witnessed the worst and exemplified the best changes in America in the last one hundred years. Named after her ancestors, she was born Lille Elizabeth Beekley on November 23, 1918, two years before women got the right to vote, on a farm in Glendale, Ohio, to a family that traces its history to the settlement of Greenwich, Connecticut in 1640, and participated in the American Revolution. She was the courageous oldest of five sisters. When Elizabeth was just seven years old, her mother died of pneumonia. Unable to care for all five siblings, their father placed Elizabeth and next oldest, Ruth, in Bethany Home, run by the Episcopal Sisters. Eventually, by high school, both girls returned to live with their father and adored paternal grandmother, her Grammar, with whom Elizabeth shared a bed. At Glendale High School, ever focused and self-defined, Elizabeth took up the trombone and also played on the basketball team. She graduated high school in a class of sixteen students. In the late 1930s, Elizabeth entered Miami University in Ohio, arriving with a wardrobe she had sewn herself. She graduated from college with honors in biology. She then attended the University of Cincinnati School of Medicine where she worked at night as a laboratory technician. She was one of two women in her 1945 graduating class of 86. During her clinical years in medical school, when the class was divided between medicine and surgery, she pitched in the softball games. The year Elizabeth graduated medical school was the first year Harvard Medical School admitted women. Had she not met and married her future husband in medical school, Dr. Harold Brodman, who pursued her with zeal, Elizabeth likely would have spent life as a doctor helping children in the 3rd world. Instead, she began her medical practice and became a mother all at once. There is a lovely photograph documenting this time, of Elizabeth in cap and bursting gown, evidencing her joy. Soon after the photo was taken, Elizabeth, just six and one half months pregnant with twin boys, went into precipitous labor; it was the last day of her State Board examinations. But with the seeming ease and determination she showed throughout her life, Elizabeth completed the exam and then went to St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, where her sons Charles and Richard were born. Eight years later she gave birth to her daughter, Louise. In those years, Dr. Elizabeth Brodman continued work as a physician, juggling parenthood, always finding time for her children. A talented painter, she also found time to study at the Arts Students League in New York with Reginald Marsh. Then, when her sons went off to college and her daughter was a bit more independent, she took a residency in Anesthesiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and following, continued work full time as an attending and associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. There, she created the pediatric anesthesia specialty and became assistant professor of pediatrics and the clinical director of the Department of Anesthesia. She was perfectly suited for pediatrics, she loved children, would compassionately ready her young patients for surgery, and comfortingly allay their fears. Returning in later years to her core desire to help those without resources, Dr. Brodman volunteered with her husband to work in third world countries, giving anesthesia for the needy and teaching foreign physicians in their own lands, using materials available there to teach new techniques. In 1972 she worked at the Avicenna Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan; in 1975 in Surakarta and Malang, Java; in 1991 in Hangchou, China and in 1992 at the Lutheran Hospital on the West Bank in Israel. In Afghanistan Dr. Brodman executed and taught the central venous monitoring technique, the first such procedure in central Asia. In China and Israel she was especially fond of the work, correcting facial deformities of children to give them a new chance in life. In 1995 at her 50th medical school reunion, Dr. Brodman was given the Distinguished Alumni Award for the Class of 1945. Dr. Brodman was a respected member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the New York State Society of Anesthesiologists and the International Anesthesia Research Society. In addition, she authored and co-authored numerous communications in reviewed journals as well as several books, book chapters, review articles and abstracts. Dr. Brodman retired from medicine at age 76, as she said, ""before she made any mistakes."" She would have liked to have died with her boots on, practicing medicine. Never liking to be inactive, she returned after retiring from medicine to studying painting with the Arts Students League at the Vytlacil Campus in Sparkill, NY. Always a deep sorrow, Elizabeth was predeceased by her son Charles in 1977 when he was 31, a heart breaking loss for the family which Elizabeth held together with nothing short of grace, love, and her astonishing strength of will. A year later, Elizabeth suffered another terrible loss, her greatest confidant and friend, her sister Midge, died in a car accident. Again Elizabeth did not let loss, though ever present, define her; she quietly, compassionately, and lovingly persevered. Elizabeth B. Brodman is survived by her devoted and adoring family: her husband of almost 72 years, Dr. Harold Brodman, a general surgeon, her son Dr. Richard Brodman, a cardiothoracic surgeon, her daughter, Louise, an architect, her granddaughter, Alexandra, a Nassau County Assistant District Attorney, and their spouses, as well as Hero and Harley - poodles who brought some light hearted play to Elizabeth in her last years. The most generous of souls, an environmentalist before the word became known, a courageous and fun loving adventurer who canoed white water and traveled the world with the desire to help others, a painter who loved the beauty of the natural world as well as the wonders of scientists and artists, a loving mother and spouse, Elizabeth made everyone better for having known her. Despite the sorrows she suffered over her remarkable life, she made everything seem effortless, and joyful. She lived by her own expectations and interests. She loved and was loved. 1"
