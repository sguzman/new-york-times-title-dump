Lehigh Navigation and Lehigh Valley were rather freely offered, and the former at one time fell off 1 1/2."

If you are weak, if you are pale and thin or if your blood is poor it is because you haven't used Johann Hoff's Extract. Johann Hoff's Extract is the perfect up-builder of strength. It is nature's own remedy, giving perfect digestion and assimilation of food without which no one can be well and vigorous."
1902-05-18T00:00:00Z,"We print on another page a careful and full account of the services rendered by the Kingdom of France to the American colonists in the War of the American Revolution.

1902-05-18T00:00:00Z,"For a number of years up to and including 1894 the railroads of Massachusetts derived a larger revenue from their passenger than from their freight service, a condition peculiar to railroad operation in parts of New England territory, and largely to that in the State named, results for the section at large showing a trifling advantage the other way."
1902-05-18T00:00:00Z,"MR. CARNEGIE is of the opinion that freight earnings, dividends, and patriotism are quite separate and distinct things. Yet patriotism had a good deal to do with producing the splendid specimens of marine architecture known as the American packet and clipper ships that Dominated the passenger and carrying trade between Europe and America and China prior to the war of 1860."

Along upper Broadway, from Sixty-sixth to Seventy-second Street, sporadic cases of street indexing may be discovered and are easily recognized as local outbreaks of enterprise in the propaganda of favorite devices."
1902-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Automobiling through sewers is the very latest thing, and to Brooklyn, which is supposed to look with scorn upon anything so unconventional, belongs the honor of the innovation.

1902-06-25T00:00:00Z,It would be difficult to find in history anything like a parallel for the cruel disappointment of the British people.

1902-06-25T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON, June 24. -- Not much notice was taken to-day of Mr. Bryan's attack on ex-President Cleveland. Members of Congress said the matter was not worth considering on the basis of what Mr. Bryan thought about the ex-President's plea for party harmony.
