She was the wife of the late Benjamin Coates and mother of Theodate Coates and Benjamin Coates Jr., grandmother of Dionicia O'Sullivan and Anatole Xavier Hernandez, great grandmother of Sebastian, Oona and Lucian. Nancy Sloane Coates was born in New York City, October 16, 1920. Her family founded ""W and J Sloane"" whose flagship department store was located at 19th Street and Broadway in the ""Ladies Mile."" W and J Sloane's decorators were responsible for the decor of the White House and the Breakers in the late 1800's. As a young woman, Nancy was inspired by Florence Nightingale. She entered the Columbia School of Nursing and graduated in 1944 earning a degree as an R.N. She also married Benjamin Coates in 1944 who was in the Navy at the time and later earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout her life, she was concerned with charities for veterans and the mentally ill. In 1956 she expanded the work of Mrs. Lytle Hull, who founded the Musicians Emergency Fund in New York City to provide professional concerts and musical therapy for wounded American veterans, to Philadelphia. Her organization raised funds by holding parties and an annual designer clothing sale. When the U.S. government took over funding for musical therapy for the veterans, the women of the Pennsylvania branch of the organization decided to continue their clothing sale with a new focus on local charities. In 1977 they reorganized as Community Clothes Charity. In the years since, the sale has grown from a one-day event in a private house to a three-day public sale. The Community Clothes Charity is continuing and every year a different charity receives the proceeds of the sale. Nancy's favorite charity recipient was ""Puppies behind Bars."" She also served on the women's committee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art for 58 years. She is much loved and remembered by her family, friends and the members of the Community Clothes Charity. 1/3"

2015-03-18T00:00:00Z,"COATES--Nancy. Nancy Sloane Coates, of Haverford, PA. died on Thursday March 12th, at home. She was the wife of the late Benjamin Coates and mother of Theodate Coates and Benjamin Coates Jr., grandmother of Dionicia O'Sullivan and Anatole Xavier Hernandez, great grandmother of Sebastian, Oona and Lucian. Nancy Sloane Coates was born in New York City, October 16, 1920. Her family founded ""W and J Sloane"" whose flagship department store was located at 19th Street and Broadway in the ""Ladies Mile."" W and J Sloane's decorators were responsible for the decor of the White House and the Breakers in the late 1800's. As a young woman, Nancy was inspired by Florence Nightingale. She entered the Columbia School of Nursing and graduated in 1944 earning a degree as an R.N. She also married Benjamin Coates in 1944 who was in the Navy at the time and later earned a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Throughout her life, she was concerned with charities for veterans and the mentally ill. In 1956 she expanded the work of Mrs. Lytle Hull, who founded the Musicians Emergency Fund in New York City to provide professional concerts and musical therapy for wounded American veterans, to Philadelphia. Her organization raised funds by holding parties and an annual designer clothing sale. When the U.S. government took over funding for musical therapy for the veterans, the women of the Pennsylvania branch of the organization decided to continue their clothing sale with a new focus on local charities. In 1977 they reorganized as Community Clothes Charity. In the years since, the sale has grown from a one-day event in a private house to a three-day public sale. The Community Clothes Charity is continuing and every year a different charity receives the proceeds of the sale. Nancy's favorite charity recipient was ""Puppies behind Bars."" She also served on the women's committee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art for 58 years. She is much loved and remembered by her family, friends and the members of the Community Clothes Charity. 1/3"

2015-03-18T00:00:00Z,"RIGG--Jean, died peacefully at her home in Cedar Key, Florida, on March 11, 2015, after an energetic and exceptionally varied life. Diagnosed with lung cancer, she had the help in her last months of her sister and friends, both local and from further away, who were with her at the end. Jean was born in Chicago, on November 17, 1938, the only child of Emily De Beukelaer and Jack Wallen. Her parents divorced, and Jean's mother married Col. Robert Rigg, who adopted Jean. His military assignments at the close of World War II took the family abroad, and Jean spent part of her early childhood in China. She grew up in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C, then attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. After graduation, she moved to New York City, where she taught school on Staten Island. In the 1960s, she joined the orbit of the Cunningham Dance Company, eventually becoming its administrator, a role that called upon her delight in responding to new challenges and unanticipated problems. Jean made many long-lasting friendships in the company and with the large circle of artists, musicians, and others who collaborated on Cunningham's projects. She left her position with Cunningham to attend Cardozo Law School, graduating in 1979. As she looked for the legal job she wanted, for a time she drove a taxicab in New York City. Jean went on to work in the television industry, but continued to be involved with the Cunningham circle. Jean's lifelong interest in artistic experimentation also drew her into the work of the Judson Memorial Church. She was a founder of the annual marathon readings of Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans. After Cunningham's death in 2009, she helped see to completion a multivolume CD collection of music composed to accompany many of his dances. In 2000 she bought her house in Cedar Key, and threw herself into activities there. Joined in her later years by her beloved partner, Amber Harris, Jean never ceased seeking out unusual opportunities. All who knew her will remember her infectious laugh and her eager interest in others, old and young. Jean did not want a funeral or a memorial service; she preferred a celebration. She is survived by her brother, Bill Rigg, of Melbourne, Florida, her sisters, Ginny McLaren, of Columbia, SC, and Jackie Wallen of Takoma Park, Maryland, and by numerous cousins. 1/3"

2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,"HARWOOD--Lowell. 85, of Short Hills passed away on March 18, 2015. Born in Newark and raised in Jersey City, Harwood returned to Hudson County after graduating from Kent State University and serving in the United States Army during the Korean War to work in the family parking business that began in 1920. Harwood built and grew the business, breaking into the competitive New York market with a shrewd business model of choosing the right locations and charging reasonable prices. The company went public in 1969, with Harwood becoming chair of Square Industries, Inc., headquartered at 921 Bergen Avenue in Jersey City where Harwood was raised. By the time the company was sold in 1997, the family operation had grown to a $100 million business with 135 locations across the United States. During Harwood's leadership of Square Industries, the company managed parking at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, NY, one of Harwood's proudest achievements. After selling the company, Harwood continued running Harwood Properties LLC, a private parking and property management company that continues to be managed by the Harwood family in Jersey City. Harwood was a pillar of the Jersey City business community, serving on the board of the Jersey City Chamber of Commerce, and served as the Chamber's president in 1958. In 1997, the Harwood Family purchased the site of the former State Theater and created the first, new residential development in Journal Square in more than 50 years, helping to transform the area into the pride of Jersey City. Harwood was also involved in numerous parking business associations, serving on the Board of Directors for the National Parking Association, the Metropolitan Parking Association and the New York Parking Association. A philanthropist in Jersey City and throughout his home state, Harwood was a dedicated supporter of Christ Hospital serving on the Board of Trustees, the Executive Board and the Christ Hospital Foundation Board for 40 years. While serving on the Foundation Board, Harwood donated funds to establish the Harwood Heart Center, a state-of-the-art coronary-care unit, which continues to bear Lowell's name. Harwood's philanthropy included more than 10 years of service as a Kean University Trustee and Trustee Emeritus. As Trustee, Harwood implemented numerous campus improvement projects and donated a beautiful stained-glass window that remains the centerpiece of the Kean Hall Conference Center. Harwood also founded the Kean University Gala Event in 1997, which raised more than $1.4 million over seven years for the school's scholarship fund, a cause for which Lowell was very passionate. In recognition of his dedicated service to Kean, he was named the University's ""Man of the Year"" at the University's sixth annual gala in 2003. The Harwood Arena at Kean University is named after Harwood in honor of his leadership and generosity for the University. The Harwoods were members of Temple Beth El in Jersey City for more than 50 years, and Lowell Harwood was a member of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Lowell Harwood is survived by his loving wife, Toby; his brother, Sanford; his children, Leslie and Craig; his grandchildren, Jonathan, David and Laura Ehrlich; and his nephews Brett and Scott Harwood. The funeral service will be held on Friday, March 20, 2015 at 10am at Bernheim Apter Kreitzman Suburban Funeral Chapel (973-422-0600) at 68 Old Short Hills Road in Livingston. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to Kean University or the charity of your choice. 1/3"

2015-03-20T00:00:00Z,"MEADE--Thomas Francis, age 80, passed peacefully on March 14 surrounded by his loving family. Tom was born on September 17, 1934 and raised in Bellerose, NY. He was the youngest of six children born to Kathryn and James Meade. Tom was a long time resident of Brookville, NY, having served as President of the Brookville Taxpayers Association, as a volunteer firefighter in the Jericho Fire Department and as a lector for 40 years at St. Paul the Apostle Church - a parish he loved and helped to build. Tom attended Manhattan College, graduating in 1956 with a B.S. He began his career at Bankers Trust Company while earning an MBA from New York University. After working on the Municipal Bond desk at Smith Barney, Tom joined Bear Stearns as a talented and spirited fixed income salesman. He loved the bond business and was a passionate mentor to many young professionals heading to Wall Street. Ultimately retiring from Bear Stearns as a Senior Managing Director, Tom earned the respect and, most importantly, the friendship of customers, colleagues and competitors. Tom loved, and was beloved by, his family and his friends. He would often regale them with stories of his shenanigans in school and stickball in the street. All who knew him were touched by his kindness, his generous spirit and his enormous heart. Tom was always an optimist and quick with an encouraging word whenever one was needed. Tom shared his time, talent and treasure with many charitable organizations. Over the years, he served as a Trustee of St. Francis College in Brooklyn, NY, and was a fundraiser for The Ronald McDonald House, The Boy Scouts of America, The Archbishop's Council for the Laity and many others. He sold thousands of boxes of Girl Scout Cookies and was the long-time ""official Santa"" at Bear Stearns. Tom's true love was his family. He was an amazing husband, father and grandfather. He and his loving wife Joan were married for 58 years. His three children, Paul (Bernadette), Charlie (Julie) and Regina (Anthony) and the loves of his life, his eight grandchildren, Lauren, Gregory, Courtney, Marielle, Perry, Gracie, Tommy and Xavier were adored by him. An avid reader of United States history, Tom enjoyed being surrounded by books and maps. He enjoyed classic WWII movies with his favorite treat, Junior Mints. He loved golf, always commiserating about his game with his buddies. When not on the golf course, he was often spotted with his leaf-blower, making sure the driveway was pristine. A summer barbecue, a dip in the pool, a Macanudo cigar in his hand while pushing a grandchild on a swing made a perfect day for Tom and that is how his family will always remember him. Tom was surrounded with love and laughter throughout his life and in his final days. His brilliant light will live on in our hearts forever. Please keep him in your prayers. Donations may be made in his honor to: St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis or to the charity of your choice. A Mass of Resurrection will be held at 12:30pm, Saturday, March 21 at St. Paul the Apostle Roman Catholic Church, Brookville, NY. He will be interred at the Locust Valley Cemetery in Locust Valley, NY. 1/3"

2015-03-22T00:00:00Z,"LARAGH, John H. MD--Died on March 20, 2015. Born in Yonkers, NY; he graduated from Cornell University Medical College and then trained in medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons where he became a world renowned clinician-scientist. By observing his patients, indentifying key medical questions, and applying scientific rigor, he showed that renin, a kidney hormone, can cause human hypertension, and that blocking it can control high blood pressure. This led to the development of two new hypertensive drug classes, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. These drugs revolutionized the treatment of hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. His discoveries led to a cover story in Time magazine in 1975. John was founding President of the American Society of Hypertension. He crossed the traditional boundaries of medicine as Chief of Nephrology at Columbia P&S, then Chief of Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He was a generous mentor - warm hearted with boyish charm who liked to sing and whistle around these prestigious institutions. He inspired generations of clinician-scientists to become leaders world wide. His patients became his friends, and they supported his research and encouraged his passion for golf. This visionary, yet humble man brought the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease into the 21st century, thereby improving innumerable lives. Dr. Laragh was 90 years old. He was predeceased by his mother Grace Coyne and father Henry Laragh. He is survived by his wife and collaborator Dr. Jean Sealey, his sons John and Robert, daughter-in-law Marci and granddaughter Eliana.

Fred made immeasurable contributions to the University during a remarkable period now recognized as a scientific renaissance at Rockefeller. A key steward of the University, he was widely respected for his exceptional financial acumen and the managerial brilliance with which he oversaw Rockefeller's operations. Fred was instrumental in creating an environment in which gifted scientists--and great science --can truly flourish.

2015-03-22T00:00:00Z,"CLARK--Jim. Legendary Builder of Modern Washington. Alfred James ""Jim"" Clark, legendary builder of modern Washington, DC, and Chairman of the Board of Clark Enterprises, Inc., died March 20, 2015. Clark Construction Group, the company he led for decades, is one of the largest privately-held construction firms in the United States. Clark Construction transformed the character and vistas of the Washington area. The company's achievements include: 28 Metro stations, the World Bank headquarters, Verizon Center, the National Museum of the American Indian, FedExField, the United States Institute of Peace, Nationals Park, Sidney Harman Hall, Arena Stage, CityCenterDC, the United States Coast Guard Headquarters, the American Red Cross Headquarters building, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Clark Construction opened its first regional office in Atlanta in 1970, followed by seven more offices over the next four decades, including locations in Chicago, Costa Mesa, Houston, San Antonio, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, and Tampa. Clark buildings include the Central Terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Ronald Reagan State Office Building in L.A., and PETCO Park in San Diego. The company also developed convention centers in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Nashville. Its projects outside the Washington area include highways and bridges, libraries, performing arts centers, healthcare facilities, and the tallest building on the West Coast. Jim Clark's personal values of honesty, integrity, and a dedication to quality helped grow Clark Construction into a national company with $4.5 billion in annual revenue. His legacy includes a reputation for fair dealing, beginning multi-million dollar projects without a written contract and leading the industry in efforts to recruit and train minorities and women for jobs in the growing construction sector. His commitment to employee safety was uncompromising. While the construction company undertakes the most challenging projects, it remains an industry leader in job site safety. Jim Clark had a passion for education. He was among the largest donors to his alma mater, the University of Maryland, where the engineering school bears his name. He endowed the deanship at Johns Hopkins University's engineering school in the name of his mentor, Benjamin Rome and made a multi-year commitment to George Washington University to create the A. James Clark Engineering Scholars program, to recruit and train engineering leaders. His generosity extended beyond education into areas of homelessness, addiction, and to a variety of organizations servicing those in need. Jim Clark and his companies have consistently been recognized as some of the Washington region's most philanthropic. His passionate commitment to service in his community is embedded in the culture of his company. Jim Clark was often sought out for his wisdom and advice. He served on the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin, Pepco, Carr America and GEICO. And, when relaxing, he turned to the outdoors to pursue his love of fishing, hunting and golf with family and friends. Born in Richmond, VA in 1927, Jim Clark moved to the Washington, DC area with his family when he was six years old. He attended Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School and graduated from Devitt Preparatory School in Washington, D.C. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Maryland. Jim Clark's career began in 1950 when he was hired by The George Hyman Construction Company. He became the company's general manager in the early 1960s. Under his leadership, George Hyman Construction gained renown as an innovator called on to execute cutting-edge projects. It was among the first companies to use the now iconic tower crane. Clark was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Hyman in 1969. He formed a second construction firm, Omni Construction, in 1977. In 1996, the George Hyman Company and Omni Construction merged to become Clark Construction. These investments and others are managed by Clark Enterprises, a holding company founded in 1972. The love and support of his life was his wife of 64 years, Alice Bratton Clark. The couple met in high school and married in 1950 at the Bethesda Presbyterian Church. Their lifetime of devotion to each other was evident to all who knew them and an inspiration to their children and grandchildren. Jim Clark is predeceased by his parents, Woodruff and Salley Wray Clark, and sister, Jeanne Curren, and is survived by his wife, Alice Bratton Clark; two sons, Paul Clark and wife Carol Parrish, of Mill River, Massachusetts and A. James Clark, Jr. (Brad) of Bethesda, Maryland; a daughter, Courtney Clark Pastrick and her husband R. Scott Pastrick, also of Bethesda, Maryland; and ten grandchildren. Known as ""Grandaddy"" or""Grand"", his happiest times were when all ten were visiting. A memorial service is planned for the Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday, April 8, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Jim Clark's honor to A. James Clark Scholarship at the University of Maryland, 3207 Kim Engineering Building, College Park, MD 20742. 1/3"

Under her professional name Gina Ingoglia, she wrote more than 80 books for children, including the awardwinning The Tree Book for Kids and Their Grown-ups, which features her lucid descriptions and luminous paintings of North American trees.

The daughter of artist Frank Ingoglia and writer and artist Danis Gerdes Ingoglia, Gina grew up in Forest Hills Gardens. She received her BA (and an honorary PhD) from Dickinson College in PA, where she met her beloved husband of 53 years, Earl D. Weiner. Gina held a BS in landscape architecture from Rutgers, and designed graceful spaces in New York and New England. As devoted as she was to her many pursuits, she somehow found bottomless time for family. From her hand-drawn valentines to her hilarious emails to her unrivaled turkey soup, she was a master of daily gestures that never let loved ones forget what lay at the heart of her generous life. She is survived by Earl; her daughter, Melissa Balmain Weiner; her son, John Barlow Weiner; her son-in-law, William J. FitzPatrick; her daughter-in-law, Caroline P. Schaefer; and her grandchildren, David and Lily FitzPatrick. In lieu of sending flowers, the family suggests donating to one of Gina's favorite organizations.

Dr. Laragh started the Hypertension Center in the 1970's. He was a true pioneer in the field; his passion for exploring and understanding the mechanisms of hypertension resulted in brilliant clinical investigations and development of a paradigm for treatment that remains relevant, useful and innovative even today. He loved medicine and his patients and they admired and loved him in return. His original discovery of the role of aldosterone in malignant hypertension led to an understanding of the important role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertension, and ultimately, to the discovery of drugs that block the system and are used widely today to treat not only hypertension but also heart disease and kidney disease. His curiosity, command of the literature, and his innovative thinking of hypertension as a heterogeneous condition that requires individualized treatment presaged the advent of precision medicine by decades. We are grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him and we miss his brilliance, humor and creativity. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Dr. Jean Sealey, his sons John and Robert, his daughter-in- law Marci, and granddaughter Eliana.

2015-03-23T00:00:00Z,"SCHECHTER--Danny, died on March 19, in New York City. Danny Schechter, aka ""The News Dissector"" aka ""troublemaker,"" grew up in the Bronx, in the progressive, union-sponsored Amalgamated Houses. His immigrant grandparents were garment workers who brought their socialist ideals with them from the Old Country. His mother Ruth Lisa Schechter was a secretary who became a poet. His father, Jerry Schechter was a pattern-maker who became a sculptor. Danny attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where he served as the editor-in-chief of the legendary Clinton News. From there it was on to Cornell, Syracuse, the London School of Economics, and Harvard as a Neiman Fellow. But this is only a small part of his life's journey. He joined the Northern Student Movement in high school and became actively involved in the Civil Rights Movement, going down to Mississippi in 1964. He became a leader in the movement to end the Vietnam War, was a member of SDS and began a lifelong commitment to South Africa in 1967 as an original member of the ""London Recruits."" He fought tirelessly against Apartheid from then on. Danny never hesitated to put his convictions on the line. In the 1970s, he turned back to his first love - journalism - and became the ""news dissector"" at radio station WBCN in Boston. He wove news and music together in collages that not only reported the day's events but also helped explain how the world worked. He was a huge influence on those who valued his independent perspective - and trusted him. He went on to become a prolific, Emmy award-winning TV producer and filmmaker, who made ""South Africa Now,"" six films about Mandela, and spent decades criticizing and cajoling the media to do a better job covering the news. He interviewed Bob Dylan. He walked with Jesse Jackson. He embraced the Dali Lama. Malcolm X nicknamed him ""Danny X."" He was invited by Nelson Mandela to his inauguration. He was determined to ""let justice roll down like waters"" and to see all people free. His commitment and integrity were never for sale. Friend to thousands. Great and loving dad to Sarah, brother to Bill and Denzil, and uncle to Ethan and Jamie. He was so much fun. So much energy. A solar flare. A meteor across our sky. If there is an afterlife, you should soon be receiving a blog post from our beloved Danny Schechter, ""the news dissector."" In lieu of flowers, please send donations in Danny's name to Cornell University, Cornell University Office of Alumni Affairs, 130 E. Seneca Street, Ithaca, NY 14850. Please specify that the donation is for the ""Civil Rights History & Memorial Project,"" which will honor Cornell students like Danny who went down south during the 1960's. We do not want this history to be lost, but to live on and inspire students today. A celebration of Danny's life will be held in New York City in the spring, at a date and place to be announced. 1/3"

Daughter of Walter and Catherine White, she was born and raised in Muncie, IN. She was a graduate of Indiana University in music and art history, and while still a student, set off alone to post-war Europe to study cello in Salzburg and Vienna. Following her interests and friendships with musicians, including members of the Budapest String Quartet, she participated in the early days of the Prades Festival for chamber music, later to become the Casals Festival. Throughout her life, Jane retained friendships with a wide circle of notable artists, classical musicians, writers, and poets. A serious and gifted musician and sculptor, she pursued her music as a young woman, playing in amateur string quartets and studying cello with Klaus Adam, and later focused on her sculpture, while residing in France, New Brunswick, Canada, and New York City. Jane was also a quiet, and generous patron of the arts, offering crucial support to help establish the young, conductorless Orpheus Chamber Orchestra on its way to world fame, the contemporary music group Speculum Musicae, and The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. These were among many cultural institutions she supported, often opening her home to private concerts and sometimes accompanying musicians on tour, wining and dining them along the way. She was a fierce defender of environmental causes, and with her companion Anne Dunn, fought many battles throughout the years against the increasing degradation of the forests of New Brunswick due to massive clear-cutting so destructive to the birds and wildlife of the province that she loved. In spite of her inherent shyness, Jane Kitselman, having grown up with three brothers, possessed the best taxi-summoning whistle in the City of New York, had a pointed sense of humor, and was known quietly to break into song at the slightest provocation flawlessly remembering lyrics going back decades. She was married to Richard Kitselman, widowed in her early thirties, and was also pre-deceased by her adoptive daughter Alice. She is survived by her companion Anne Dunn Moynihan, their close and extended family, and a circle of friends who will cherish the memory of this very original individual. 1/3"

2015-03-25T00:00:00Z,"LARAGH--John, MD. The Rogosin Institute mourns the passing and celebrates the life of John H. Laragh, MD. A graduate of Cornell University Medical College (now Weill Cornell), he trained at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and became a world-renowned clinician- scientist. His discovery of the link between renin, a mostly forgotten kidney hormone, and the mechanisms that govern normal blood pressure regulation and the pathogenesis of hypertension provided the foundation for the modern treatment of high blood pressure and its heart and kidney complications. His tenacious pursuit, limitless imagination, and perspicacity led to the development of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, which revolutionized the treatment of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The broad scope of his work is evident from his academic titles, which extended beyond traditional boundaries: at Columbia he was Chief of Nephrology, and then at Cornell he was Director of Cardiology and the Cardiovascular Center, and member of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery. The impact of his collaboration with Dr. Albert Rubin, the late Director of The Rogosin Institute, still resonates today. He has trained generations of leaders worldwide in hypertension research. In addition to these accomplishments, Dr. Laragh was the founder and inaugural President of the American Society of Hypertension and the first Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Hypertension. He was first and foremost a master clinician whose guiding principle was to improve the lives of all patients. He loved his family, friends, colleagues, and all that life had to offer. All of us at The Rogosin Institute salute Dr. Laragh's remarkable life and offer our condolences to his wife and co-investigator Dr. Jean Sealey, his sons John and Robert, daughter-in-law Marci, and granddaughter Eliana.

She was the daughter of Dina and Mario (a soccer Olympian) and the sister of the late Mario (Mimma). In 1947 she married Michael Mahon and soon thereafter emigrated to the United States. One of her fondest memories was the sight of the Statue of Liberty from a transatlantic troopship deck. As a war bride she encountered many challenges, but soon adapted to the many cultural changes. She was a student at Columbia Medical School until her family obligations took precedence. She was a very proud and caring mother. She took her responsibilities as a single parent quite seriously and ensured a smooth transition to adulthood for her children. Mara was proudly ahead of her time in breaking the glass ceiling. Her professional career began as a comparison shopper with Abraham & Straus, moved on to the fashion industry at Korvettes and culminated as the founder and head of the very successful International Division of May Department stores. She gained worldwide recognition for her knowledge and skills in the areas of textiles and fashion, as well as her exuberant and inimitable spirit and personality. Her experience in the upper echelons of international commerce was constantly sought out by specialists in her field from North America, Europe and Asia. She was a life and career mentor to many. Her professional and personal travels took her to many countries around the world where she expressed her special appreciation for cultures and their nuances. Her time was not solely devoted to her work, as she was a great lover of the arts and music. Her greatest love was for her family. She devoted her time and love to them across the generations.

2015-03-26T00:00:00Z,"SCHWEBEL--M. Mac. In loving memory of Morris ""Mac"" Schwebel who passed away on March 24th. A family man, successful corporate lawyer and philanthropist, Mac, as he was known by all, left his mark in New York where he resided for the first half of his life and then in Palm Beach, Florida where he spent his retirement. He was married to the love of his life, Irene Michaels Schwebel until her death in 1985. He was devoted to his three children, seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren. His passion was educating Jewish children. One of his greatest accomplishments was founding the Solomon Schechter School of Westchester, where he was Chairman of the Board and of which the upper campus is named in his honor. He served for many years on the Board of Overseers for the Jewish Theological Seminary of New York. One of his proudest moments was receiving an Honorary Doctorate from JTS with former Vice President Al Gore. Deeply committed to Conservative Jewish life, he also supported the Masorti Movement in Israel. Born in Brooklyn in 1909, the youngest of six brothers, he graduated with honors from St. John's Law School. As a Wall Street corporate attorney for over thirty years, he was a lawyer for Warner Bros-Seven Arts, served on the Board of Directors of Warner Bros. and was instrumental in facilitating a merger that created Warner Communications, Inc., the precursor of Time Warner Inc. After retiring from the law, his love of golf led he and two partners to build Sherbrooke Golf and Country Club in Lantana, Florida. He spent many happy days on the golf course, playing like a person half his age! His other passion was the opera. His children fondly remember him singing opera throughout their home in White Plains, NY. During his life, he and his wife, regularly attended performances of the opera in New York and Palm Beach. For many years he served as President of the Board of the Palm Beach Opera. He is survived by his children John Schwebel (Zelda Schwebel), Laura Landau (Les Landau) and Anne Diamond (David) and his grandchildren, Andrew Schwebel and James Schwebel (Lisa Schwebel), Leigh Landau (Jimmy Stewart), Michael Landau (Paige Landau), Lee Diamond (Michelle Diamond), Emily and Evan Diamond and great grandchildren, Jessica, Alexis, Jacob Schwebel, Natalie Stewart and Jonah Diamond. He had a generous spirit and a love of life and was as principled as he was prosperous. He became known as ""Mac the nice"" and when asked throughout his life how he was, he would always reply, ""never better."" Perhaps it was his positive outlook that helped to create such a wonderful and enriched long life. He will be dearly missed, by everyone who knew him. Services 11 am Thursday at Temple Beth El. 2815 N. Flagler Drive, West Palm Beach, Fl.

2015-03-26T00:00:00Z,"ASHDOWN--Cecil Spanton has died at 92, familiarly known as ""Span,"" died Monday morning (March 23) at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan after treatment for longstanding heart disease. Trained as an engineer, he had served as a naval officer and became a recognized authority on steamship histories. A native New Yorker he was born at Flower Hospital on May 14, 1923, and brought up in Bermuda with a residence in New York. After prep school at Ridley College in St. Catharine's, Ontario, he earned his BSE (Bachelor of Science and Engineering) degree at Princeton in 1944, then proceeded immediately to the U.S. Naval Academy, emerging as an Ensign. There ensued several years of active service, during which he served as Chief Engineering Officer aboard the U.S.S Wrangell in World War II. He remained in the U.S. Navy Reserve and eventually retired as a Lieutenant Commander. After his wartime service he entered Harvard Business School (MBA, 1948) and began a business career of more than three decades with the Alcoa Steamship Company, where he became Purchasing Manager, served until 1980, and remained a consultant for life. He also became secretary of the board of directors of the Pan-Ore Steamship Company. Mr. Ashdown was a member of the World Ship Society, the Naval Reserve Association, the Navy League, and the Naval Order of the United States. His abiding nautical interests led to board service for the Bermuda Maritime Museum, the Steamship Historical Society of America (1950-76), and the Maritime Industry Museum at Fort Schuyler. Other interests led to board memberships for the Grenfell Association of America, of which his father, Cecil Spanton Ashdown, Sr., was the founding financial director for Sir Wilfred Grenfell, and the Musicians Emergency Fund, of which his wife, Marie M. Ashdown, has served as executive director since 1985. Love for music also led to his membership in the Metropolitan Opera Club in 1966 and board service for that organization. In addition to his wife, Mr. Ashdown's survivors include their sons Cecil S. Ashdown III and Charles Coster Ashdown; stepchildren Mrs. Vivian Gartman Silliman, Rev. John Stephen Gartman; and grandchildren Marygrace and Helen Ashdown. No plans for visitation or a memorial service have been announced. 1/3"

Their special love was their cabin in northern Michigan and the trout of Slagle Creek. In 1980, she founded her book business, publishing biannual catalogs of rare and collectible offerings of books on fishing, hunting, and related natural history. She eventually rose to become one of the preeminent dealers in the world known for her expertise in her specialty. She retired in 2010, but continued advising collectors and other dealers.

She and Jim Bowman were married in 1957, and would have celebrated their 58th wedding anniversary on March 29th. Judith was multi-talented and versatile, having mastered a variety of arts and crafts. She was a gardener and woodworker, dress-maker and decoupage artist and established several successful businesses. She also was a consummate collector, frequenting estate and tag sales throughout Westchester. Her children could always anticipate a gift of a unique garage sale ""find"", one that always surprised and delighted them. Judith is survived by her husband Jim, and their three children, Reed Bowman of Sebring, Florida, and his wife Charlotte and children Seth and Mei; Stacy Gates of Manchester Center, Vermont, and her husband David and children Kinsey and Jamie; and Todd Bowman, of North Kingstown, Rhode Island, and his wife Keegan and son, Rhys.

2015-03-29T00:00:00Z,"OPPENHEIMER--Harry. 93, of Lauderdale by the Sea, Florida, passed away on March 9, 2015. Born in 1921 to parents Paul and Hedwig in Alzey, Germany. As a young man, he moved his family and fled the holocaust, immigrating to the United States in 1939. This act saved the lives of his brother and parents. Mr. Oppenheimer was drafted and served in WWII behind the Battle of the Bulge. He was deployed to the Philippines for the staging of the invasion of Japan. The work of J Robert Oppenheimer and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ironically suspended this. In addition, due to his contempt for the Nazis and fluency in German, he also was trained as an OSS agent. After the War, Harry met his wife, Ellen, also a German emigrant, in New York City. For over 50 years, they built one of the most successful retail meat businesses in the history of New York City. His clients included the likes of Barbara Streisand, Joseph Papp, Hal Holbrook, Clarence Williams III, Sir James Galway and others. The meat for the 1976 Democratic Convention held in New York City, nominating former President Jimmy Carter, was supplied by his world famous, H. Oppenheimer Company in Manhattan. Mr. Oppenheimer was an avid swimmer and scuba diver. He visited many of the seven underwater wonders of the world with his son. In the summer of 1984, he was invited to accompany the New York Zoological Society on a live aboard vessel in the Red Sea and helped them identify and document the Photoblepheron or ""flashlight fish"", which was indigenous to that region. Mr. Oppenheimer enjoyed the ocean and lifted weights regularly until his 85th birthday. He enjoyed travelling between his New Jersey and Florida homes. Originally a practicing reformed Jew; Harry had declared himself atheist after the tragic loss of his son, Robert, granddaughter, Elyse and many deaths of relatives in the concentration camps. His is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Ellen; son Jeffrey, a Neurosurgeon, brother Rudolph, daughter-in-law, Missy and grandchildren, Brianna, Jenna, Paul and Benjamin.

She took her responsibilities as a single parent quite seriously and ensured a smooth transition to adulthood for her children. Mara was proudly ahead of her time in breaking the glass ceiling.

2015-03-29T00:00:00Z,"GLASS--Gilbert W.,died after a brief illness in Roosevelt Hospital on February 21, 2015. He was 98 years old. He is survived by remaining members of the Glaschman family, Barbara Hellman and Robert Schey, and by his nephews Edmund and Jay Glass, and other members of the Glass Family. A longtime resident of Manhattan, he was born and grew up in Newark, NJ, the son of the late Sarah and Samuel Glass. He and his two brothers attended public schools there, and graduated from Weequahic High School. He then set out to explore the United States, traveling extensively to many parts of the country. Inspired by the professional and financial achievements of an uncle in Chicago, he returned to Newark and enrolled in the Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology), earning a BS degree in mechanical engineering in 1941. During World War II he was employed by the United States Navy, and at the end of the war decided to start a business. He remained in Newark, becoming a sales representative nationally in 1946 for major manufacturers of engineering equipment. He became successful quickly and as the business expanded he began to hire a sales force, many of whom remained with him until his retirement in 1975. During his years in business Gil developed friendships that flourished with people in his organization as well as with business contacts, most notably John Morris of Louisville, KY. His warm, extroverted personality, huge smile and bow ties, as well as his keen intelligence left lasting impressions on almost everyone he encountered. During the early 1950's Gil moved to Manhattan, where he lived for the rest of his life. He settled in Greenwich Village, where his free spirit and artistic interests thrived, and in the early 1960's, he moved to the Upper West Side, where he lived for the rest of his life. Gill Glass loved New York....he walked everywhere until his mid-90s....connecting with people, taking the children of friends on jaunts they still, now in their middle age years, remember vividly. He was every kid's ""Uncle Gil."" He enjoyed all the musical opportunities of Harlem with his friend ""Schey,"" the Big Band and Jazz eras, the Metropolitan Opera and all that Lincoln Center offered, the museums, and his ""front yard"" across the street from his residence, Central Park, which he simply loved. Strangers befriended him, drawn to his warm smile and genuine interest in them and everything around him. His extraordinarily curious intellect led him to travel extensively, becoming fluent in Spanish during his many visits to Mexico, where he continued to expand his business. Gil Glass was an ""original."" He loved people and they loved him. His personal warmth and genuine interest, as well as an extraordinary sensitivity to the needs of others, led to his involvement with an extensive number of organizations. In retirement, he devoted himself to managing his finances, philanthropy and ""living."" He traveled extensively throughout the world but retained a particular love for Mexico and Central America. In Guatemala he was instrumental through his financial support in helping to establish educational opportunities for indigenous children and impoverished women, providing support financially to women in the region who struggled to support their families. These loans had to be repaid, teaching business responsibility as well as basic business skills to the recipients. Today, Pevi Fundap is a successful educational operation in Guatemala. Throughout his long and productive life he had a major interest in philanthropy. The spectrum of his interests was extensive. He ferreted out little-known charities that captured his interest, supporting them long before they were well-known. He also was a major supporter of established organizations and had on-going associations with them. He was a long -time supporter of his alma mater, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where a library was named for him, recognizing his lifelong support. He was a very early supporter of YouthBuild USA, helping Dorothy Stoneman get support for the youth of the Bronx from union members of the Building Trades, teaching them skills that enabled them to rebuild abandoned buildings. Today YouthBuild USA is a national organization, receiving support from prominent donor organizations and the government, and is expanding its activities to other continents. He was also involved through the years with The Delta Society (now named Pet Partners), Doctors Without Borders, The United Jewish Appeal, The American Technion Society, The Smithsonian Institution, Nature Conservancy, Green Chimneys, The New York Public Library, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Planned Parenthood, The Central Park Conservancy, The American Museum of Natural History, WNYC, WQXR, the Institutions at Lincoln Center, The Doe Society, Earthwatch USA, The American Field Service, Accion International and others. He had a deeplyrooted concern for those he felt needed his help and whom he wanted to help, and for the organizations whose work he admired and wanted to support. He lived a simply wonderful life, on his terms. Our special thanks go to Dr. Lynn Ratner and Dr. Dialecti Voudouris and their entire warm and wonderful staff who cared for him during those last difficult months. We also thank the staff at 25 Central Park West, his longtime residence, who looked out for his well-being, and with whom he enjoyed mutual friendships during the years he lived there. And our profound thanks also to a friend for many years, Pat Duffy, who has always been there with his steadying support and friendship. Gil's mantra was ""to love and be loved in return."" He did, and he was. Funeral services were private. A celebration of his life is being planned for a future date. For additional information, call (212) 581-3640.

Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date. A private interment was held at Fishers Island. Services by Dodge-Thomas. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Maggie's name to the World Rehabilitation Fund (worldrehabfund.org), the Boys Club of New York (bcny.org) or the Central Park Conservancy (centralparknyc.org)."

Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed. She particularly liked to empower young people, whether through education, rehabilitation, job opportunities and/or recreational opportunities. Renowned for her charm and her charisma, she lit up every room she entered. Truly, she was one of a kind. A memorial service to celebrate Maggie's life will be held at a later date. A private interment was held at Fishers Island. Services by Dodge-Thomas. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Maggie's name to the World Rehabilitation Fund (worldrehabfund.org), the Boys Club of New York (bcny.org) or the Central Park Conservancy (centralparknyc.org)."

2015-04-04T00:00:00Z,"PURNELL--Marguerite H. (Maggie) of Locust Valley, Fishers Island and New York, NY passed away peacefully at home on March 26, 2015 after a long illness. She was 94. Maggie was predeceased by her beloved husband of 45 years Richard I. and her adored sisters Constance H. Oliver O'Neil and Audrey H. Hilliard. She is survived by her daughter Marguerite W. Purnell, her son Peter F. Purnell, her four grandchildren James, Theodore, Robert and Henry. She is also survived by her cherished sister Sally H. Childs and numerous nieces and nephews, on whom she doted. Maggie's energy and enthusiasm were boundless, and she put those traits to good use, first as a daughter, sister, aunt, wife, mother, and friend and later as a long serving board member of many charitable organizations. In her 20's she worked under the tutelage of Dr. Howard A. Rusk in the nascent field of physical rehabilitation, an area of interest that would remain near and dear to her throughout her life. She served on many boards and was a tireless champion for each one, from her early years with the Junior League to her involvement with the Rusk Institute (and later the World Rehabilitation Fund), the International Center for the Disabled, FOCUS, the Venture Fund, the Episcopal Mission Society, Classroom, Inc. and in particular her lengthy involvement with the Boys Club of New York and The Central Park Conservancy, where she was one of the four founders of the Women's Committee. Maggie was a quintessential people person, and she demonstrated it every day through her profound love for her family, her friends and those whose causes she championed.

2015-04-05T00:00:00Z,"FRANKENBERG--Babette Meyers Known to her family and many friends as ""Bobbe,"" died February 28 at age 98, having lived a richly variegated and adventurous life that channeled her pioneering spirit as a feminist before her time. Bobbe was born on May 16, 1916, in the hardscrabble mining town of Bisbee, AZ, and moved with her parents to Beverly Hills when Sunset Boulevard had yet to be fully paved. She was a successful business woman in the 1940s, when female entrepreneurs were a rare breed, and through the 1980s, as women increasingly rose to prominence in corporate America. She found great success in commercial and residential real estate as well in public relations. In the 1950s she handled Mark Taper's PR for his ambitious Lakewood development. With Coldwell Banker, Bobbe sold many of the more remarkable Los Angeles homes of her time, remarkable both for their lavishness and their residents. Bobbe was also an outdoors woman and athlete, fishing and riding horses. She skied and played tennis competitively, often against men. She raised and trained dogs and was a sports car enthusiast, well-known for the rainbow-painted Porsche in which she made her real estate rounds. Bobbe traveled widely throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. As a patron of the arts she greatly enjoyed classical music and in recent years, Lady Gaga. Her rapier wit and playful sense of humor was matched by her care and concern for others. Never one to talk about herself, Bobbe focused her incandescent personality on whomever she was with; her joyful presence absorbed as much as her quiet smile radiated. Bobbe leaves behind friends and classmates from Beverly Hills High School (1935, Class President), UC Berkeley and UCLA (1939, BA European History). She will be dearly missed by her family, including her niece Jeanne Meyers (Richard Carr) and nephews Charles Franklin (Susie) and Wayne Franklin (Susan); her grandnieces and nephews, Elissa (Clark Middleton) and Lucas Meyers (Margaret); Zachary Franklin (Sofia Zander), Seth Franklin (Kristin), Judd Franklin (Tybe Goldberg); and Jason Franklin, Barrett Franklin (Lea) and Shannon Hegarty (Terry); as well as by her great grandnieces and nephew, Ellington and August Meyers; Molly Franklin and Clara Zander; and Adena Franklin. Bobbe was predeceased by her younger brothers Benny (Ben Jr.) (same day as Bobbe, February 28, but 1973) and Maynard Franklin (2011). Beneficiaries of Babette's profoundly philanthropic nature include several health and educational institutes. She and her brother Maynard left the gem and mineral collection originally amassed by their parents, Ben and Clara, in Bisbee, to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, where it can now be seen by all. 1"

Returning to California, she was the founding marketing director at the College of Professional Studies of the University of San Francisco.

Born February 4, 1928 to the late Mark William and Lauretta Hayes Laibe and raised in Akron, Ohio, John attended Buchtel High School and Cornell University, where he earned a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in 1951. John was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity and member of the track team. Among his fondest memories of his Cornell days was a trip to England he made with the track team, in which they competed against Oxford and Cambridge and met Roger Banister. After graduation, John went to work for Enjay Chemical company, leaving after two years to serve as an officer in the U.S. Navy, first at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and then in Subic Bay, Philippines. Upon his return to the U.S. he rejoined Enjay (future Exxon), where he spent his entire career, rising to Vice President and President positions in New York, Hong Kong, Miami and Darien, CT, retiring in 1993. These postings gave the entire Laibe family many treasured experiences in faraway lands. In addition to his Exxon tenure, his career included service on various corporate and community boards of directors, including Chairman of Acheson Chemical Company and Cell-O-Core, whose founder introduced John to his adored wife of 57 years, Ann Jesse Davis Laibe, who survives him. As the chairman of Acheson Industries, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals, John led the company to a successful sale to Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1998. In memory of his classmate Howard A. Acheson Jr. he and Acheson Industries endowed the Laibe/Acheson Professor of Business Management and Leadership Studies at Cornell. His community leadership extended to organizations as diverse as the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, St. Mary's School of Greenwich, and Sankaty Head Golf Club. John's optimism in both life and business was unquenchable and infectious, and it combined with a tenacity that would never allow him to give up on any challenge. He would in turn challenge others to share that outlook and to seek out creative ways to surmount their own obstacles. Anyone approaching him could expect a quip, an uplifting comment, insight and an offer of help. John held a lifelong passion for the game of golf, which he pursued as a member of the Stanwich Club, Sankaty Head Golf Club and the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club, along with countless other courses around the world. It was the setting for both business and personal interaction. For over fifty years, he eagerly anticipated their annual visit to Nantucket for its beauty and the prospect of golf at Sankaty. In addition to Ann, he is survived by daughter Anne Laibe Bertolino and her husband Jerome, of Boxborough Mass.; sons Marc and his wife Liza, of Rowayton Conn.; Christopher and his wife Lynne of New Orleans, La.; and Timothy, of Rochester N.Y., along with 16 grandchildren. His daughter Constance Laibe Hays preceded him in death in 2005; her beloved husband John is a close member of the family.

2015-04-07T00:00:00Z,"Tannenbaum--Bernice S. Bernice S. Tannenbaum, who served as national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, from 1976 to 1980, and who later founded Hadassah International, passed away on April 6. She was 101. We mourn the loss of a great leader not only of Hadassah but of the Jewish people, said Marcie Natan, Hadassah's current national president. Bernice was one of the most beloved and productive Hadassah figures of the past half century. She was a tower of strength and a fount of wisdom. The legacy of accomplishment and inspiration that she leaves is immeasurable. During her presidency, Mrs. Tannenbaum initiated the practice of Hadassah periodically holding its annual convention in Israel, convening the first such Jerusalem gathering in 1978. From 1980 to 1984, Mrs. Tannenbaum served as chair of the Hadassah Medical Organization. In 1983, she founded Hadassah International, transforming Hadassah from a U.S.-based Zionist movement into a global network that is currently represented in 21 countries. After the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution 3379, equating Zionism with racism, in 1975, pro-Israel groups around the world, supported by the American government and many others, mobilized to have the resolution overturned. Mrs. Tannenbaum spearheaded the U.S. campaign for repudiation, which came to a successful conclusion in 1991 when the UN repealed the resolution. In 2000, Mrs. Tannenbaum played a central role as spokesperson for Hadassah's successful campaign to achieve NGO consultative status in the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Mrs. Tannenbaum co-chaired the Strategic Study Research Committee on Hadassah's Israel projects, which led to the creation of the Hadassah Foundation in 1998. The purpose of the Foundation is to provide funding to initiatives that share Hadassah's mission but are beyond the scope of its projects. Mrs. Tannenbaum served for many years as the Foundation's liaison to the Hadassah National Board. In 2003, Mrs. Tannenbaum received Hadassah's highest honor, the Henrietta Szold Award for Distinguished Humanitarian Service. Other recipients of the award, established in 1949, have included Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Golda Meir, Yithzak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Elie Wiesel. In recognition of Mrs. Tannenbaum's lifetime of service to Hadassah, Israel and the Jewish people, in 2009 the Hadassah Foundation established the Bernice S. Tannenbaum Prize, which recognizes innovative contributions to advance the lives of women and girls in Israel and the United States. Mrs. Tannenbaum was born Bernice Franklin and raised in Brooklyn, NY. She studied at Brooklyn College, earning a bachelor's degree in English literature and art. She joined Hadassah in 1944 and was a founder of the Kew Gardens Chapter in Queens, NY, eventually becoming the chapters president. She later became president of the Long Island Region. Mrs. Tannenbaum's first husband, Hyman Salpeter, died in 1969. They had one son, Richard, who died in 2003. In 1975, she married Nathan Tannenbaum. He died in 1991. Mrs. Tannenbaum is survived by her daughter-in-law Deanna Salpeter Warshauer, three grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America"

He was, first and foremost, a gentleman. Ralph was raised in Utica, New York, the only child of Emil C. and Friedericka (Fuchs) Hansmann. In 1940, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hamilton College in nearby Clinton, NY and went on to Harvard Business School. Upon completing his MBA, Ralph enlisted in the Navy and worked in the Bureau of Ordinance in Washington, D.C. While serving in the Navy, he established a friendship with William T. Golden that developed into a lifelong working relationship. Together with Harold F. Linder, they worked as partners in a private investment firm in New York City for sixty years. In his capacity as an investment analyst and portfolio manager, he served as trustee and treasurer for such institutions as The New York Public Library, The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, and Hamilton College. In recognition of his stewardship of its endowment, Hamilton awarded him an honorary degree in 1992. Ralph Hansmann leaves a legacy of wise counsel and goodwill. He died in his sleep at his home in Ridgewood, New Jersey in the early morning of April 2, 2015, leaving his wife of seventy-one years, Doris Macdonald, a son, Robert, a daughter, Jane, her husband, John McKean, and five grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, April 14th at 11am at the Community Church of Ho-Ho-Kus, 400 Warren Avenue, Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ with a reception to follow at the Ridgewood Country Club, 96 West Midland Avenue, Paramus, NJ.

She lived at her farm, The Fields, Bedminster, NJ with her family since the early 1950s. Her husband George Wall Merck died in 1984. She recently celebrated her 95th birthday and was delighted by the surprise entertainment: a belly dancer. Elizabeth Amy Mead, or ""Betty"" as she was known, was born in Guelph, Ontario in 1920 to British parents, Olive Mary Holden and William Arthur Mead. Her mother remarried Edward H. Bennett, the architect and city planner, known for his collaboration with Daniel Burnham on the 1909 ""Plan of Chicago."" She grew up in Chicago and Lake Forest, Il. She attended the Chicago Latin School for Girls, Miss Porter's School, and for a short stint, the Brillantmont School in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she said she learned to speak French, iron a man's shirt in 5 minutes and make perfect hollandaise sauce. She continued as an excellent and adventurous cook for the rest of her life. Mrs. Merck said she grew up on a horse, starting at the age of five. Betty continued to be connected to horses for her entire life - with the Pony Club, winning point-to-points, fox hunting, on a riding safari in Botswana, and running steeplechase horses. She served for several years as Joint Master of the Essex Foxhounds in her mid 80s, and rode her beloved steed Smokey until she was 94. Betty served her community in elected office on the Bedminster Township Council from 1975-1989. She served on local township commissions including the Open Space Farmland Advisory Committee, the Lamington Conservancy, and on the boards of the New Jersey Nature Conservancy, Raritan Headwaters Association, the Lamington Conservancy and Miss Porter's School. A lifelong conservationist, Mrs. Merck was recently celebrated by the Garden Club of America Regional Chapter with an award for conservation. Bedminster recently dedicated a special park bench to her with words she liked, ""It is nice to be important but more important to be nice."" In 1995, she and her son George ""Laddy"" Merck began a partnership, The Fields Stable, starting with the first of their winning jumpers, Brigade of Guards. Tom Voss was the trainer of their many winners including Your Sum Man, Approaching Squall, and Guelph. Guelph became three-time champion filly. Betty loved to grow her own flowers and vegetables started from seed and loved to tend to her fields, trees and all her animals. She will be remembered for her loyal service in her community, her gracious style, and her energetic enjoyment of a robust social and sporting life. In addition to her husband, she was predeceased by her brother, Joseph Mead, and her stepbrother Edward H. Bennett, Jr. She was the mother of Antony M. Merck (Ann Wimberley), Josephine A.

2015-04-08T00:00:00Z,"SERENBETZ--Warren. Warren Lewis Serenbetz, of Harrison, New York, a pioneer of the container leasing industry, passed away peacefully early on the morning of April 4 at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut, surrounded by his loving family. In his business life, he was a man of great vision and acumen; in his home life, he was a man of great warmth and generosity. Mr. Serenbetz was born in Brooklyn, New York on March 27, 1924. He graduated from Jamaica High School in Queens. In 1944, he graduated from the Navy Officers Training Program at Columbia University with a B.S. in engineering and the rank of ensign. Mr. Serenbetz served as a gunnery and recognition officer aboard the USS Weiss in the north and south Atlantic during World War II. In 1948, Mr. Serenbetz married Thelma Randby, whose love, friendship, and support sustained him over the next seven decades of his life. Mr. Serenbetz received his M.S. in engineering from Columbia in 1949. Shortly thereafter, he began work for the Railway Express Agency as an assistant chief engineer, rising to senior vice president in charge of technical services. During his tenure at Railway Express, he became involved with the American Management Association and the Containerization and Intermodal Institute. He joined the American National Standards Institute where he helped to develop the standards for the international intermodal cargo container. In 1960, Mr. Serenbetz established the REA Leasing Corporation, eventually forming the cargo container leasing division known as Interpool. The division was acquired by Steadman Industries in 1968, with Mr. Serenbetz as president and chief executive officer. Interpool separated from Steadman Industries and registered as a public company in 1969. Two years later the company was listed on the American Stock Exchange. Prior to the companies sale to Thyssen Bornemiza in 1978, Mr. Serenbetz was instrumental in fostering many innovations in the intermodal container business, including chassis leasing in the United States, and the formation of Con-Trailer and Railpool. In 1986, he was part of a small group that formed Trac Lease, a chassis leasing company. In 1988, a group of investors including Mr. Serenbetz bought Interpool from TBG. Interpool grew into the largest marine leasing company in the world, leasing over one million containers. It was sold to the Fortress Group of Funds for $2.4 billion in 2007. Mr. Serenbetz, as a representative of Radcliff Group Inc., oversaw operations and then served as a consultant at the company until his retirement in 2004. During his long career, Mr. Serenbetz served as president and chairman of the Containerization and Intermodal Institute, receiving the organization's Connie award. He served on the board of the American Management Association and as chairman of the compensation committee. He was the co-founder of the Institute of International Container Lessors and was named CEO of the Year by Financial World magazine. Over his four decades in the industry he mentored many executives who were able to witness his tenaciousness and admirable leadership skills. Mr. Serenbetz was a member of the Union League Club in Manhattan, The Apawamis Club in Rye, New York, and the Larchmont Yacht Club. He served as a member of the board of sessions at the Larchmont Avenue Church and ushered regularly up until his death. In December of 1997, Mr. Serenbetz and his wife Thelma established the Serenbetz Family Foundation, a charitable organization whose core mission is to provide educational opportunities for deserving children and young adults. The stewardship of this foundation became one of the passions of their lives. Mr. Serenbetz loved the sea. From boyhood summers at his family's summer home in Cutchogue, to his last vacation in the Caribbean, the sea was for him a source of pleasure and renewal, whether in the water or on it. He was an avid yachtsman and spent many happy hours captaining his sloop and his trawler. Swimming, snorkeling, and walks on the beach with Thelma were among his favorite pastimes. Above all, Mr. Serenbetz was the patriarch, and along with Thelma, the heart and soul of their large and growing extended family. Despite his many remarkable achievements, it was their achievements - professional, educational, athletic, and artistic - of which he was most proud and that brought him the most joy. Mr. Serenbetz is survived by his cherished wife Thelma; his four sons -Warren and his wife Cindi of Wilton, CT; Paul of New Haven, CT; Stuart and his wife Jean of Stamford, CT; and Clay of Friday Harbor, WA; his six grandchildren - Christin (Weberman) and her husband Adam; Warren III and his wife Jenni; Tucker; Hunter; Skyler; and Robert; and by two great-grandchildren; along with many loving nieces and nephews and their spouses and children. A memorial service will be held on Friday, April 10 at 4pm at the Larchmont Avenue Church, 60 Forest Park Avenue, Larchmont, New York, after a private internment ceremony. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Warren's memory to the Centennial Fund at the Larchmont Avenue Church. 1/3"

2015-04-09T00:00:00Z,"NATHAN--Vivian, gifted actor, mentor and teacher, died in her sleep Friday night, April 3, 2015 at The Actors Home in Englewood, NJ. She was 98 years old and an original member of The Actors Studio, founded in 1947 by Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford among others. Vivian made her Broadway debut after winning the John Golden Auditions and appeared in such Broadway productions as ""Sundown Beach"", directed by Elia Kazan, as well as the first plays by Tennessee Williams, including ""The Rose Tattoo"" with Maureen Stapleton and ""Camino Real"" with Eli Wallach, David J. Stewart and Joseph Anthony. For her portrayal of the Charwoman in ""Anastasia"" directed by Alan Schneider, she won the 1955 Clarence Derwent award. In ""The Investigation"" by Peter Weiss, a docudrama about Auschwitz, her performance was so riveting audiences believed she had been a holocaust survivor. Her last Broadway performance was in ""Golda"" with Anne Bancroft directed by Arthur Penn. In addition to her Broadway work that spanned from 1948 to 1977 she participated, at the Actors Studio and theaters across the country, in numerous productions by Ibsen, Chekhov and O'Neill whose plays she profoundly loved. Her 19 film appearances include ""Teacher's Pet"" with Clark Gable, ""The Young Savages"" with Burt Lancaster, and ""The Outsider"" with Tony Curtis. In ""Klute"" with Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland, she played Jane's psychiatrist, infusing those scenes with a powerful emotional reality. She featured in over 50 television productions. Her favorite experiences were doing live television in ""Playhouse 90"" and ""Studio One"". She appeared regularly in ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" from 1958 through 1961 and worked in television until 1989. Until 1999, Vivian served on the Board of Directors for The Actors Studio with Ellen Burstyn, Estelle Parsons, Paul Newman, Lee Grant and Al Pacino. As a session moderator and teacher, Vivian's acute understanding and passion of the actor's craft brought an internal clarity to all those who worked with her. She was held in high regard by her peers. The actress, Kim Stanley, never prepared a part without working with her friend and mentor, Vivian Nathan. Born Vivian Firko in 1916 in New York City, Vivian was the daughter of Hipolit and Anna Firko. Her husband of over 50 years, Nathan Schwalb, died in 2000.

2015-04-10T00:00:00Z,"NATHAN--Vivian, gifted actor, mentor and teacher, died in her sleep Friday night, April 3, 2015 at The Actors Home in Englewood, NJ. She was 98 years old and an original member of The Actors Studio, founded in 1947 by Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford among others. Vivian made her Broadway debut after winning the John Golden Auditions and appeared in such Broadway productions as ""Sundown Beach"", directed by Elia Kazan, as well as the first plays by Tennessee Williams, including ""The Rose Tattoo"" with Maureen Stapleton and ""Camino Real"" with Eli Wallach, David J. Stewart and Joseph Anthony. For her portrayal of the Charwoman in ""Anastasia"" directed by Alan Schneider, she won the 1955 Clarence Derwent award. In ""The Investigation"" by Peter Weiss, a docudrama about Auschwitz, her performance was so riveting audiences believed she had been a holocaust survivor. Her last Broadway performance was in ""Golda"" with Anne Bancroft directed by Arthur Penn. In addition to her Broadway work that spanned from 1948 to 1977 she participated, at the Actors Studio and theaters across the country, in numerous productions by Ibsen, Chekhov and O'Neill whose plays she profoundly loved. Her 19 film appearances include ""Teacher's Pet"" with Clark Gable, ""The Young Savages"" with Burt Lancaster, and ""The Outsider"" with Tony Curtis. In ""Klute"" with Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland, she played Jane's psychiatrist, infusing those scenes with a powerful emotional reality. She featured in over 50 television productions. Her favorite experiences were doing live television in ""Playhouse 90"" and ""Studio One"". She appeared regularly in ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" from 1958 through 1961 and worked in television until 1989. Until 1999, Vivian served on the Board of Directors for The Actors Studio with Ellen Burstyn, Estelle Parsons, Paul Newman, Lee Grant and Al Pacino. As a session moderator and teacher, Vivian's acute understanding and passion of the actor's craft brought an internal clarity to all those who worked with her. She was held in high regard by her peers. The actress, Kim Stanley, never prepared a part without working with her friend and mentor, Vivian Nathan. Born Vivian Firko in 1916 in New York City, Vivian was the daughter of Hipolit and Anna Firko. Her husband of over 50 years, Nathan Schwalb, died in 2000. She is survived by her three nieces, Diane Everline, Vivian Mullett and Elizabeth Lebens, as well as her god-daughter Elissa Myers and Ms. Myers' children, Nina and Sasha Friedman, as well as her oldest friend, Nohmie Myers. She will be greatly missed. She was greatly loved. The memorial service will be at ""The Riverside,"" 76 St. at Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY on Sunday April 12 at 5:00pm. 1/3"

This was followed up by another almost two decades in Heritage Hills, Somers, NY, and the final few years in Ossining, NY at the Atria.

2015-04-11T00:00:00Z,"CONNOR--Dr. Frances Partridge, Professor Emeritus of Education at Teacher's College, Columbia University, died on March 28, 2015 at her home in Boca Raton, FL. She was 95. Dr. Connor was the head of the Department of Special Education at Teacher's College (TC) for 23 years, from 1966-1989. She was also Director of the Special Education Research and Demonstration Center, and responsible for a multi-million dollar grant which allowed Teacher's College to construct the four story campus building, Thorndike Hall. Under her leadership, TC's Department of Special Education enrolled the largest number of graduate students in the nation in the 1980s. Dr. Connor's association with TC began in 1949 with the award of her Master's degree and subsequently with her Doctorate in 1953. She taught children with Cerebral Palsy in Suffern, NY and children with physical disabilities at the New York Rehabilitation Hospital in West Haverstraw, New York. After serving as a Research Associate for the Department of Education in Washington DC and as a Research Associate for the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, she joined the TC Faculty and rose through the ranks quickly. She also taught at Hunter College's graduate program for several years. Dr. Connor was a sought after special education speaker and consultant, giving hundreds of speeches on educational issues, and consulting on educational programs throughout the nation and in over 60 countries around the world. Her sabbatical years were spent teaching as part of intensive graduate teaching programs in foreign countries. During the memorable year of 1962 she consulted in over 18 countries around the world and even one weekend left after classes on Friday, spoke at Oxford University and was back in time to teach Monday classes at TC. Dr. Connor was politically active in both Albany and Washington D.C. working to create positive change for disabled children. She served as Chairperson of Governor Hugh Carey's Committee on the Handicapped and was a member of the five person committee which helped close the infamous Willowbrook State School. Her efforts over many years in the 60's and 70's were crucial in the passage of the national law to make mandatory the education of all handicapped children. She served for many years on the National Advisory Committee to the United States Office of Education (now the Department of Education) and was a member of the Steering Committee of the White House Conference on the Education of the Handicapped from 1975-1978. She was a member of the Board of Trustees of Mt. St. Mary College, Newberry, NY from 1970 until her death. She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from New Rochelle College. Her work for the Counsel for Exceptional Children (the largest professional organization on behalf of children with special needs) led to her presiding over the group in 1963 and 1964, to her being awarded The Best Contribution Award, and the J.E. Wallace Wallin Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also an officer and member of numerous other educational societies. Her extensive and notable research publications and writings are too numerous to name. Her contributions in education and advocacy have changed the world, and she will be remembered fondly by many. Frances Connor was predeceased by her loving husband of over 50 years, Dr. Leo Connor and two of her three sisters, Anne and Sybil. She is survived by her sister Katherine McIntyre of New York and many nieces and nephews. A Mass of the Christian Burial will be celebrated at 9:30 A.M. on Friday, April 24, 2015 at St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church, 501 SW 3rd Ave, Boca Raton, FL 33432.

2015-04-12T00:00:00Z,"MERCK--Elizabeth Mead. Died peacefully at home with her loving family, hospice nurses by her side, and her two beloved Jack Russell Terriers on her bed Friday, April 3. She lived at her farm, The Fields, Bedminster, NJ with her family since the early 1950s. Her husband George Wall Merck died in 1984. She recently celebrated her 95th birthday and was delighted by the surprise entertainment: a belly dancer. Elizabeth Amy Mead, or ""Betty"" as she was known, was born in Guelph, Ontario in 1920 to British parents, Olive Mary Holden and William Arthur Mead. Her mother remarried Edward H. Bennett, the architect and city planner, known for his collaboration with Daniel Burnham on the 1909 ""Plan of Chicago."" She grew up in Chicago and Lake Forest, Il. She attended the Chicago Latin School for Girls, Miss Porter's School, and for a short stint, the Brillantmont School in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she said she learned to speak French, iron a man's shirt in 5 minutes and make perfect hollandaise sauce. She continued as an excellent and adventurous cook for the rest of her life. Mrs. Merck said she grew up on a horse, starting at the age of five. Betty continued to be connected to horses for her entire life - with the Pony Club, winning point-to-points, fox hunting, on a riding safari in Botswana, and running steeplechase horses. She served for several years as Joint Master of the Essex Foxhounds in her mid 80s, and rode her beloved steed Smokey until she was 94. Betty served her community in elected office on the Bedminster Township Council from 1975-1989. She served on local township commissions including the Open Space Farmland Advisory Committee, the Lamington Conservancy, and on the boards of the New Jersey Nature Conservancy, Raritan Headwaters Association, the Lamington Conservancy and Miss Porter's School. A lifelong conservationist, Mrs. Merck was recently celebrated by the Garden Club of America Regional Chapter with an award for conservation. Bedminster recently dedicated a special park bench to her with words she liked, ""It is nice to be important but more important to be nice."" In 1995, she and her son George ""Laddy"" Merck began a partnership, The Fields Stable, starting with the first of their winning jumpers, Brigade of Guards. Tom Voss was the trainer of their many winners including Your Sum Man, Approaching Squall, and Guelph. Guelph became three-time champion filly. Betty loved to grow her own flowers and vegetables started from seed and loved to tend to her fields, trees and all her animals. She will be remembered for her loyal service in her community, her gracious style, and her energetic enjoyment of a robust social and sporting life. In addition to her husband, she was predeceased by her brother, Joseph Mead, and her stepbrother Edward H. Bennett, Jr. She was the mother of Antony M. Merck (Ann Wimberley), Josephine A. Merck (James Stevenson), George F. Merck (Adele Shook), six grandchildren, Oona Coy and Morgan Coy, Elizabeth Merck Lake and Elliot Merck, George Merck and Grace Merck, and six great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St Luke's Church Gladstone, NJ on May 30 at 11am.

When he graduated from high school in 1934, he aspired to become a journalist, but no post was available. He took a ""temporary"" job at Citibank as a page and studied economics nights at New York University. When a New York Times offer came, he couldn't accept it because of conflicting hours. The bank then paid his way through Princeton. When he graduated in 1941, he was recruited for the diplomatic service and posted to Panama, then Cairo. His first assignment, developing courier networks, was shadowy and took him over much of the world. In 1944, he was present at the Breton Woods monetary and financial conference. He then volunteered for the Marines, becoming adjutant of a Corsair fighter squadron and attaining the rank of captain. In 1946, he returned to the State Department and was appointed secretary of the Second West Indian Conference, convened to improve economic and social conditions throughout the islands. Following this, he rejoined Citibank, rising through the ranks to become chairman of its credit policy committee, overseeing a $77 billion loan portfolio. He was a visiting lecturer at the University of Virginia for twenty-one years and founding chairman of the Darden School's Center for International Banking Studies. Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh awarded him a doctorate in 1981, honoring him as ""a leading innovator and thinker in the field of banking and education"". He was a fruitful author and teacher, inspiring generations of bankers to develop professionally. When he retired from banking in June 1982, Mueller became chairman of SAAB Cars in this country and served on the boards of Skandinaviska Enskilida Banen (New York), Atlas Copco, and other companies in the Wallenberg group. He was chairman of the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce-USA and a director of the Marcus Wallenberg Foundation in the U.S. The King of Sweden decorated him with the Order of the Polar Star in 1986.

He served in the U.S Army during the Korean War, then returned to the business and used his determination, creativity, and hard work to build Kay Chemical Company into a worldwide supplier of cleaning chemicals to the giants of the fast food industry. When Kay merged with Ecolab in 1996, he was proud that Kay maintained its location in Greensboro and continued to thrive. Mr. Kaplan's life was guided by his desire to make the world a better place, and he had a lasting impact through his significant philanthropic efforts. With the creation of the TOLEO Foundation, he and his wife Tobee pursued a deep commitment to philanthropy in education, women and children's issues, homelessness, hunger, healthcare and human services, the arts, civil rights, and quality of life for the greater community in general and the Jewish Community in particular.

He was a major supporter of United Way and Urban Ministries, and he funded food programs in needy areas in Eastern Europe and Israel. He was a major contributor to the arts in Greensboro, including the Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, Greensboro Symphony, EMF and Triad Stage, whose Pyrle Theater is named for his late mother-in -law Pyrle Gibson. A visionary thinker, Mr. Kaplan created two international organizations to address global needs. Through his Wealth and Giving Forum, he educated and motivated others to use their wealth for charitable purposes. With The Alliance for Global Good, he encouraged innovative solutions to poverty, health and environmental, issues, funding grants worldwide, including the building of a maternal health clinic in Ghana. Among his many awards, Mr. Kaplan received an honorary doctorate from the Jewish Theological Seminary, Greensboro Chamber of Commerce's Thomas Z. Osborne Citizen of the Year Award, Greensboro Jewish Federation's Benjamin Cone, Sr. Leadership Award, and the 2014 NCCJ Citation Award.

2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,"RICHARDS--David Kimball, age 75 died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at home in Santa Monica, California, with his family Carol, Adam, and Peter at his side. He was an investment manager with a global and historical perspective, ethical in business and in the conduct of his life. As an investor, his special gift was drawing connections between seemingly disparate events and displaying a brave and contrarian bent, setting him apart and keeping him a step ahead of others. He devoted much of his life to making sense of the most complex of matters as a way to make the world a better place. He possessed great intellectual curiosity and pragmatic wisdom which informed all his pursuits. He was a wonderful observer of economic history and a generous supporter of the work of the Joint Centers for History and Economics at Harvard and Cambridge Universities. He supported pioneering research at the RAND Corporation to articulate a vision for a successful Palestinian State, once peace is achieved. He supported a second ambitious RAND study on the costs to Israel and Palestine of continued conflict, to be released this spring. He was a member of the RAND Board of Trustees, and served on the Board of Advisors of RAND Health and RAND Center for Middle East Public Policy. He was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Robert Ladd Richards M.D. and Janice Kimball Richards and grew up in Vermont. He received a Bachelor's degree in English literature from Harvard College in 1961, a Master's in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Wadham College, Oxford in 1963, and a Master's in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1965. He kept strong ties to Harvard and Wadham, as a valuable advisor and supporter, serving on the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors at Oxford and as a Foundation Fellow at Wadham, and at Harvard on Dean's Councils and the Committee on University Resources. David won three varsity letters rowing for the lightweight varsity crew at Harvard for three undefeated years in 1959, 1960 and 1961, and was elected captain in his senior year. His boat dominated its American competitors and won the E.A.R.C. Championships three years in a row. Internationally, in 1959 and 1960, the lightweights won the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, the premier rowing event in the world, setting three course records in 1960. He went on to row for the Oxford University Crew and Isis Boat Club, then coached the Harvard Lightweight Crews for two years while attending Harvard Business School. His passion for rowing continued throughout his life. David had a deep respect for the people and communities of the Maine Coast. As a citizen of the world, he enjoyed global travel. However, he nourished his spirit in Maine, walking, hiking and lobster-roll lunching with friends. For 35 years, fishermen, seals and others witnessed David on the ocean in the calm early morning hours, joyfully rowing his single shell among the islands off Stonington. He is survived by his wife, Carol, his two sons Adam and Peter, two grandchildren Theo and Ian, their mother Jane, and his brother, Robert. 1/3"

2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,"STARK--Morgan B. It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our dear friend and colleague Morgan B. Stark, 75, on April 13, 2015. Born in 1939 in New York, New York, Mr. Stark was a legendary investor, dedicated philanthropist and iconic teacher. He is survived by his wife of nearly half a century, Sidney, sons Nick and Mason, daughter-inlaw Jacqueline, and grandchildren Dante and Nicolette. Mr. Stark was a Managing Member of Ramius, LLC where he served most recently as the Chairman of Ramius Alternative Investments and Head of Macro Trading Strategy. Widely regarded as one of the most respected and knowledgeable investors in the industry, Mr. Stark began his career in the 1960s at Chase Manhattan Bank where he received a comprehensive grounding in syndicate management, municipal bonds, bond trading and sales management. He remained with the company in various roles until he joined Chemical Bank as Senior Vice President and Treasury Department Deputy Head in 1979. Mr. Stark's unwavering dedication to his clients and extraordinary knowledge of the financial markets propelled him into roles of increasing importance within the bank, resulting in his appointment to the role of President and CEO of Chemical Securities, Inc., in 1989. After serving in this role for four years, he joined Granite Capital International Group as a Portfolio Manager and Managing Director to develop a non-correlating investment management business. In 1995, he and Thomas W. Strauss joined Ramius as partners with Peter A. Cohen in the development of Ramius' investment management business. Mr. Stark was widely credited for working with his peers to develop Ramius into a successful alternative investment management business with his unwavering commitment to employees and clients. Mr. Stark served as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He also once chaired the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Bond Market Association, where he was a long time member. Mr. Stark attended the Cornell University Industrial Labor Relations School and held a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from New York University. He served for three and a half years in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to his professional accomplishments, employees recognized Mr. Stark for his generosity and commitment to the long-term welfare of his employees. As Managing Member of Ramius he advocated for employees to have access to a wide range of estate, retirement planning and health care programs and personally advised many colleagues on their use. Known as a skilled raconteur and bon vivant, Mr. Stark had no shortage of hobbies, including music, skiing and golfing. A dedicated gardener, Mr. Stark took up bee keeping in his effort to enhance his floral garden in North Haven, New York. In 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Stark were invited to dinner by legendary violinist and oenophile Itzhak Perlman. Mr. Stark, eager to share his love of fine wines, brought a 1982 Chateau Lynch-Bages. Perlman, it turns out, had planned to serve the very same Bordeaux. A quick friendship developed and Mr. Stark soon after became President of the Board of Directors of the Perlman Music Program where he committed himself to helping the Program renovate its campus to meet the future needs of young musicians. In 2011, Mr. Stark told The Wall Street Journal that his work with the Program, ""Fills my soul,"" and that the young musicians he had met, ""are people that if they don't become the next best and the greatest cello or violin player, they are likely to be doctors or lawyers. But they will be wonderful people."" Mr. Stark was active in a number of industry and philanthropic activities including his position as a member of the Investment Committee for the American Heart Association--Heritage Affiliate. He also previously served as President, Vice President, and member of the Board of Directors of the Dealer Bank Association and as a trustee to various charitable organizations including the Stires-Stark Foundation. Donations may be made in Mr. Stark's memory to The Perlman Music Program, 19 West 69th Street, Suite 304, New York, NY 10023. You will be missed.

Over the years we were partners in establishing the Wall Street Run for the Heart Association, we were partners at Granite Capital and finally at Ramius. That says it all about the character of this man. He was generous in so many ways and was a mentor to so many throughout his life. One could always count on Morgan for advice and counsel no matter who you were or whatever the subject, and so many at Ramius did. His passion and his presence will leave a big void and I will personally miss him. Tom Strauss 1/3"

2015-04-19T00:00:00Z,"HOLMBERG--Theodore, ""Ted"" lived a vibrant life full of stories. His friends remember him as being charming, generous and a witty conversationalist who loved verbal sparring. An award-winning newspaper columnist as well as a reporter, editor, and publisher, he was also a serious and thoughtful person who cared about people and events. Born on July 16, 1931, on Staten Island, NY, to Teodor Linus Holmberg (from Sweden) and Elizabeth ""Lil"" (Codd) Holmberg (from England/Ireland), his parents instilled in him a deep respect for learning and achieving. His father served as a Merchant Marine officer in World War II, then worked at The New York Daily News. Ted graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and Brooklyn College, playing basketball for both. He received athletic and academic scholarships and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. His childhood in Brooklyn provided him with many of the defining elements of his life: his love for beaches; his life-long interest in athletics; his love of reading and writing and his love for newspapers. His romance with newspapers began when he wrote a sports column for the Sheepshead Bay News; he later graduated from the Columbia School of Journalism with honors. Ted's career included two years in the Army, 20 years as a reporter, editor and Assistant Vice-President of the Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin, culminating in his dream of owning newspapers for 25 years. In 1975, he purchased the Pawtuxet Valley Daily Times, (later the Kent County Daily Times) in West Warwick, R.I. Ted sold the paper to Independent News Corp., based in New Zealand to become President of the U.S. division and bought community newspapers in Houston and California. As President of the New England Society of Newspaper Editors in the 1980s, Ted led the first delegation of journalists to the Soviet Union. He taught journalism at Providence College. After retirement in 2000, Ted split his time between Bethesda, MD and Rhode Island. Ted pursued his love of writing, publishing three murder mysteries: ""Murder Between the Sheets; The Art of Murder""; and ""Murder Moons the Beach."" Ted and his wife Susan shared their love of global travel, movies, the opera and ballet, dancing and walking on beaches. He had a genuine love for his wife, his children and grandchildren. Ted passed away at home in Bethesda, MD, on April 12, 2015, after a valiant struggle with cancer and its effects.

2015-04-19T00:00:00Z,"RICHARDS--David Kimball, age 75 died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at home in Santa Monica, California, with his family Carol, Adam, and Peter at his side. He was an investment manager with a global and historical perspective, ethical in business and in the conduct of his life. As an investor, his special gift was drawing connections between seemingly disparate events and displaying a brave and contrarian bent, setting him apart and keeping him a step ahead of others. He devoted much of his life to making sense of the most complex of matters as a way to make the world a better place. He possessed great intellectual curiosity and pragmatic wisdom which informed all his pursuits. He was a wonderful observer of economic history and a generous supporter of the work of the Joint Centers for History and Economics at Harvard and Cambridge Universities. He supported pioneering research at the RAND Corporation to articulate a vision for a successful Palestinian State, once peace is achieved. He supported a second ambitious RAND study on the costs to Israel and Palestine of continued conflict, to be released this spring. He was a member of the RAND Board of Trustees, and served on the Board of Advisors of RAND Health and RAND Center for Middle East Public Policy. He was born in Portland, Maine, the son of Robert Ladd Richards M.D. and Janice Kimball Richards and grew up in Vermont. He received a Bachelor's degree in English literature from Harvard College in 1961, a Master's in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Wadham College, Oxford in 1963, and a Master's in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1965. He kept strong ties to Harvard and Wadham, as a valuable advisor and supporter, serving on the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors at Oxford and as a Foundation Fellow at Wadham, and at Harvard on Dean's Councils and the Committee on University Resources. David won three varsity letters rowing for the lightweight varsity crew at Harvard for three undefeated years in 1959, 1960 and 1961, and was elected captain in his senior year. His boat dominated its American competitors and won the E.A.R.C. Championships three years in a row. Internationally, in 1959 and 1960, the lightweights won the Thames Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta, the premier rowing event in the world, setting three course records in 1960. He went on to row for the Oxford University Crew and Isis Boat Club, then coached the Harvard Lightweight Crews for two years while attending Harvard Business School. His passion for rowing continued throughout his life. David had a deep respect for the people and communities of the Maine Coast. As a citizen of the world, he enjoyed global travel. However, he nourished his spirit in Maine, walking, hiking and lobster-roll lunching with friends. For 35 years, fishermen, seals and others witnessed David on the ocean in the calm early morning hours, joyfully rowing his single shell among the islands off Stonington. He is survived by his wife, Carol, his two sons Adam and Peter, two grandchildren Theo and Ian, their mother Jane, and his brother, Robert. 1/3"

Alfred's achievements in business were matched only by his unwavering philanthropy. He translated his own personal success into support for countless civic, medical and arts institutions. Alfred acquired Sotheby's in 1983 and used his innovative retail experience to transform the auction market during his tenure. Once the province of dealers, Alfred opened the auction process to private collectors in a way that had never been done before and he played a critical role in shaping a modern vision for the art market. Passionate about art, he amassed an enviable collection and was a tireless supporter of museums, including the Detroit Institute of Arts. Alfred remained devoted to Sotheby's throughout his lifetime and we will always remember him as a loyal friend, gifted visionary and great humanitarian.

He is survived by his loving wife Gina, his daughter Eva Drabkin and husband Jess Drabkin, and grandchildren Michael, Hilary and Brooke, and by son James Garfinkel and wife Naomi Garfinkel and granddaughter Maya. David and Gina had a 60-year marriage and a 61-year love affair. David was from Sosnowitz, Poland, the son of Yakov and Chava Garfinkel. They were devout Radomsky Chassidim. David was the youngest and the last surviving child of nine brothers and sisters, six of whom perished in the Nazi death camps. He spent World War II in Nazi slave labor camps and death camps, including Markstadt, Auschwitz, Buna, Dora and Bergen Belsen. To us, David was a superhero, an indomitable spirit and a fighter who survived not only the camps, but four different types of cancer, and for the last five years a heart valve that barely functioned. Had you met him, you never would have known he had a bad day in his life. Everything was always ""perfect."" He loved life. He was a generous and selfless man who was devoted to his family, and who loved being surrounded by his friends. David was a rock on which you could always depend. He knew his values and he knew himself, and he never wavered from what he believed. Our hearts are broken. A great light has gone out of this world. 1/3"

Loving husband of Susie for 56 years, father of Jennifer and Bill, grandfather of Benjamin, Evan, David and Eric, brother of Betty, Madeline and Winnie, brother-in-law of Ellen, and father in-law to David and Paula.

Like his father, Frank was active in Jewish charities and led the UJA of Monmouth County for any years. He had a lifelong interest in women's education and served on the Board of Trustees of Mount Holyoke College. He enjoyed Ocean Beach Club, his flat in Oxford UK, and his horse brass and tobacco jar collection, which reflected his southern heritage.

She was 97. The love she gave was universally returned, and it is easy to understand why: Helen offered the world a broad, beautiful smile and infectious laugh; she slathered sweetness on us, each person made to feel almost like one of her sublime, signature cookies or delightfully tailored birthday poems. Perhaps this was particularly so with children -- hers and others. These were some of the beacons from Helen's soul that could part the darkness. Her voice is stilled now, a voice that brought to life, with brilliant color, a time when she grew up, a time that is long gone. But the stories live on in all who survive her and help keep her spirit alive. Helen's darling husband George, who predeceased her, was surely the center of her life for 69 years. With him she rose from humble beginnings; with him she made her beautiful homes; with him she enjoyed many magnificent trips, among them were visits to European cities and art museums she dreamed of going as a child; with him she had a family. Her children, Stephen Yelen (and wife Rosalie,) William Yelen, and Charles Yelen (and wife Barbara) survive Helen, were blessed by her motherhood, and mourn her deeply. Helen's daily care and concern for her children was unmatched. One thing for sure: they never went unnourished - she thought through every meal, every snack, every forkful; she cared about what they ate, that they ate, and how they ate. Oh, and she did her share of eating as well. There was always gastronomic bounty in that home. Her grandchildren, Jennifer, Elizabeth Weiss (and husband Daniel,) Ariel, and Joanna; and great-grandchildren, Elijah and Caleb are eternally grateful to have had Grandma Helen in their lives. You could not conjure up a better, more perfect Grandma - to listen to Helen, eureka, none of her grandchildren have any faults! She is also survived by loving nieces, nephews, and cousins. Many who have departed were essential to Helen, these include her beloved younger sister and brother, Blanche Lederer and Joe Zwillenberg (and surviving wife, Alice a vast array of cousins, aunts and uncles; and her close-knit group of friends -- especially Millie, but also Florence, Sarah, Rose, and Blanche. (Helen claimed to have done better in her classes than all her friends at Tilden High in Brooklyn, Class of 1935; most assuredly in French, but not in Geometry. No one is around to dispute the claim.) May she be reunited with all of them, and with her father, Morris, and with her mother Sarah whose illness and death when Helen was young seared her. While her childhood was tainted by great pain, it was also leavened by the unstinting loyalty and affection she received from loved ones. What joy they gave her! A joy Helen clung to and savored her whole life. And so she managed, with an inner strength, and with the outward support of many, to rise far above and beyond those painful beginnings and to give so much light to her world. We were all touched by and cherish the grace she showered on us; we were all made to feel special. So long, doll. In lieu of flowers or food, the family requests contributions be made to the UJA or any other charity of your choice. Services: Star of David Memorial Chapel, 1236 Wellwood Avenue.

Gallagher, the health system's founding president and chief executive officer. Jack died suddenly Saturday night, April 18, of a heart attack at his home in Palm Beach, FL. He was 83. Jack was a legendary leader whose foresight and vision as president and CEO of North Shore University Hospital (NSUH) in Manhasset laid the groundwork in the early 1990s for hospital mergers on Long Island and Queens, creating a model for the integrated health systems that are so prevalent in today's healthcare market. During an era when managed care was first taking hold and hospitals were struggling financially, Jack sought to level the playing field for healthcare providers. He negotiated a merger with what was then known as Community Hospital at Glen Cove in 1990, before formally establishing the North Shore Health System in 1992. Over the next four years, he would develop relationships with Huntington, Plainview, Franklin, Forest Hills, Syosset, Staten Island University and Southside hospitals, before the network expanded further with the 1997 merger with Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center. The historic merger created the North Shore-LIJ Health System that stands today as the largest in New York State and the nation's 11th largest non-profit health system. A Queens native who obtained a business degree from Holy Cross College, Jack left the family tire business in his early 30s to begin pursuing a career in healthcare administration, earning a master of science degree from Yale University in epidemiology and public health. He joined the administrative staff at what was then called North Shore Hospital as an intern in 1963, working for then-Executive Vice President and CEO Dennis Buckley. The two would work closely together over the next two decades before Jack became president and CEO in the 1980s - a job he would hold until his retirement at the end of 2000. He had continued to serve as a life trustee of the health system. In addition to his unparalleled dedication and commitment to his work, Jack was extremely affable and approachable, enjoying coffee and breakfast with front-line staff and playing the piano at hospital holiday parties and other gatherings. On behalf of the staff and trustees of the entire North Shore-LIJ Health System, we extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Aileen O'Halloran Gallagher; sons John, Robert, Thomas and Paul; daughters Grace Haggerty and Louise Grecco; seven step-children; 27 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. In honor of Jack, flags at all North Shore-LIJ facilities will be flown at half-staff. Calling hours will be held this Thursday, April 23, from 3pm to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm at the Oyster Bay Funeral Home. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Friday, April 24, at 10am at St. Gertrude's Catholic Church in Bayville. Please join us in remembering Jack and his family in your thoughts and prayers.

After changing careers in his 30s, leaving the family tire business to study public health at Yale University, the Queens native had been driven by a vision of a superior health care system that would not only survive the assault of profit-driven managed care companies but thrive and deliver charity care to the poor as well. Gallagher, a workaholic with an affable nature, joined the administrative staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset in 1963 as an intern. He was appointed Executive Vice President in 1982. In the 1990s, when managed care started making inroads into New York, Gallagher began hatching a plan to develop an integrated health care system, joining multiple hospitals and care facilities that could span a broad geographic area, achieve economies of scale and, most important, be able to exercise muscle in rate negotiations with insurance companies and HMOs. More recently, he merged the North Shore Health System with the Long Island Jewish Medical Center to create the North Shore-LIJ Health System, a powerhouse of 18 hospitals and numerous outpatient centers that stretches from Suffolk to Staten Island. It is no exaggeration to say that Jack Gallagher's vision is one of the reasons that the North Shore-LIJ Health System exists today. After his retirement, he remained active, serving on many boards. When Jack was not playing the piano or painting, he would be on the water enjoying his boat. He is survived by his wife, Aileen O'Halloran Gallagher, six children: John, Grace, Robert, Louise, Thomas and Paul, seven stepchildren, 27 grandchildren and four greatgrandchildren. For his friendship, for his wisdom, for his deep sense of caring, he will be missed. Visitation will be at Oyster Bay Funeral Home on Thursday, April 23 from 3-5pm and 7-9pm. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at St. Gertrude RC Church in Bayville, NY on Friday, April 24 at 10am. Interment is private. oysterbayfuneralhome.com 1/3"

2015-04-26T00:00:00Z,"HAVEN--Ellen, 65, of Garrison, New York, died peacefully on April 1, 2015 after a long illness. To the end of her days, almost incomprehensibly, she never allowed the maladies inflicted upon her to interfere with her cheery disposition, and she remained fun to be with, and possessed of great generosity of spirit throughout. Ellen was born in Peekskill on July 24, 1949 and grew up in the Hudson Valley, ultimately settling there with husband John, son Darius, and a virtual menagerie of pets after spending many wonderful years in New York City. Ellen loved the environment, whether it be wild, cultivated, or urban and had an affinity for both the land and the water, whether river or sea. She was an ardent gardener, naturalist, and lover of all creatures great and small, especially her dogs. She had a lifelong passion for the arts, specifically visual art, and spent most of her professional life working in the arts community in Westchester and Putnam counties, both as administrator and artist, in her very last position serving as the Chair of the Board of the Garrison Arts Center. In both her work and her personal relationships, Ellen shall be remembered for her unpretentious wisdom and quick wit, unflagging kindness, and invariable good humor. She had an ability to find common ground in people - in their thinking, in the work toward which they could contribute their different talents, and in the shared interests to which each could add a perspective. Ellen was a person whose visit always left others feeling just a little bit better than before. Needless to say, Ellen's constituency in the not-for-profit community was extremely well served by these attributes. The great joy Ellen experienced in her art became striking in her last few years, when, while undergoing the most intense medical treatments, she became the most prolific in her abstract creations, so much so that others around her were often drawn into her enthusiasm in the context of their own creative efforts. She leaves behind great memories and smiles with all that she knew. She was predeceased by her parents, Elliott W. Schryver and Alice Stinnett Schryver. She is survived by her husband of many years, John Grimmer, their son Darius Hartwell, and two grandchildren, Isaiah and Delilah Hartwell, all of Portland, Oregon, and her sister, Ann Temple, and nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, all from the San Francisco Bay Area. Ellen was buried in the Cold Spring Cemetery in a private ceremony. A larger celebration of her life will follow in mid-June and will occur on the banks of the Hudson River at Garrison Landing in the shadow of the Garrison Arts Center and Bear Mountain. In recognition of Ellen's belief that the act of charity should be a very personal choice, anyone wishing to remember Ellen is requested to make a donation in her name to their own favorite charity. We, Ellen's family, greatly mourn her loss. We know that that sentiment is shared by friends near and far. 1/3"

He was a man of many high-level accomplishments in a wide and varied field of endeavors, and was one of the most self-transformative of men. After studying Comparative Religion at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he earned a doctorate in Comparative Religion at the University of Chicago. He subsequently served on the faculty of Moravian College and of Lehigh University, where he resigned from a tenured position in order to attend Yale Law School. After earning a J.D. from Yale in 1983, he practiced law in New York City as an Associate at Richards & O'Neil and subsequently at Davis Polk & Wardwell. He left the practice of law in order to teach law at New York Law School. The author of several books and scholarly articles, he retired from academia and law to write fiction and to pursue a deep study of science and the natural world; these intensive studies eventually culminated in and influenced his full-time creation of art and the development of his signature style. His sculptures and paintings, often involving the intricate placement of hundreds of pieces of glass, beads and jewels, related to his sensualist nature and his vision of ecstasy in color, form and light. These intricate works were accomplished despite his having been born with only one hand. His will provides for a Foundation to preserve and promote his art. Of his many achievements, Park took significant pride in his overcoming a decades-long depression, which he triumphed over with therapy and anti-depressants, in his cultivating deep friendships, and in creating art. His abundant capacity for love and his generous spirit in his appreciation of others will be missed by those lucky enough to have known him. Park McGinty was born in Atlanta, GA, in 1943, to Dr. A.

He was drafted into the US Army in 1942 and served in the US Army of General George Patton when it conquered Germany in 1945.

He later enrolled in medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, graduated in 1951, and completed residencies at the major hospitals in the Philadelphia area in 1956. He began his practice in Philadelphia, associated with the Psychoanalytic Center of Philadelphia, with which he was associated for more than 60 years.

In 1976 he organized the first international meeting on children and adolescents in Philadelphia. He led the Discussion Group on Vulnerable Children of the American Psychoanalytic Society for many years, holding annual meetings in New York, as well as sessions at the Association for Child Psychoanalysis. He edited three volumes on this subject with his colleagues Dr. Hossein Etezady and Dr. Bernard Pacella.

The founding director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University and award-winning curator, author and critic, died at 65 on March 27, 2015 after a courageous two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. Rush began his tenure at the Broad MSU in 2010 and was instrumental in opening the museum and in establishing its vision of exploring global contemporary culture and ideas through art.

From 2005-2009, Rush served as the director of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, where he was widely recognized for his leadership during a controversial and successful effort to legally prevent the university from selling its collection and closing the museum. He had received several awards for his curatorial work and in 2015 was awarded The Charles A. Gliozzo International Award for Public Diplomacy from the MSU Office of International Studies and Programs. Prior to his work in the art museum field, Rush was an experimental theater artist and early in his career was a Jesuit priest and psychologist.

2015-04-27T00:00:00Z,"KUFLIK--Frieda, born December 11, 1924 in the small Polish town of Szydlowiec, passed away peacefully on April 26, 2015. The oldest child of Herschel and Shaindel Kurlender, her parents and two younger brothers, David and Avraham, perished in the Holocaust. She survived a horrific internment at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp from which she was liberated by the English Army on April 15, 1945, a day emblazoned in her memory. In December 1946 she arrived in New York City with her sole surviving brother Yachov (Jack). Penniless, she worked in a garment factory sewing piece goods to earn a living. In 1948, sitting at the ""singles table"" at a friend's wedding, she met a fellow Holocaust survivor, Seymour Kuflik, from Korczyna, Poland. They married that same year, had two children, Sidney and Sheila, and made a beautiful life together in this new country they both so loved. They raised their family in the Bronx and Queens, NY, with many joyous summers spent at bungalow colonies in the Catskill Mountains. Frieda was a loving and devoted wife to her husband, who predeceased her in 2005, a caring and adoring mother, grandmother and great grandmother, a doting aunt, and a dear friend to many. She was the stereotypical Jewish mother ""on steroids"" and for that she was treasured by one and all. She is survived by her son Sidney Kuflik and his wife Madeline, her daughter Sheila Ben and her husband Stuart, her grandchildren Chad Ben and his wife Lindsey, Ian Ben, Cara Ruda and her husband David, Joanna Kuflik, Elana Kuflik, and her great-granddaughter Sara Ben. The running gag in our family was that when the topic of conversation turned to the number of children a couple should have, a topic she often raised herself, with certainty and clarity Frieda would proclaim, ""Three is nice"". Although we would chuckle at this oft repeated phrase, which she freely shared with brides and grooms at weddings, the truth is that her actions and ideas reflected deep seeded wisdom and thoughtfulness. She will be terribly missed by her family, friends and anyone who was fortunate enough to have known her. Donations in her name may be made to the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, or any charitable organization where the memory of those lost during the Holocaust are remembered and sanctified. 1/3"
