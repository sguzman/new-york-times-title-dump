Chaim Bermant's brief eighth novel closely resembles the oft-told tale of the American Jew who comes of age during World War II, discovering in wartime his Americanness as well as his ambivalence about his Jewish identity.

1988-02-05T00:00:00Z,"AT first glance, the mid-1970's seems like the least inventive phase in the career of Andrzej Wajda, the brilliant, prolific Polish director. His trilogy from the 50's, ending with the masterly ''Ashes and Diamonds,'' assessed the emotional cost of World War II. In 1976, he would tear down Stalinist icons in ''Man of Marble.'' But earlier in the decade, films such as ''A Wedding'' and ''Land of Promise,'' both set in the 19th century, seemed to signal, if not a retreat from the political wars, at least an escape from the pressure of recent events. ''Land of Promise,'' the 1975 film that will have its first commercial run in New York at Cinema Village today and tomorrow, offers only a visual rest from contemporary battle. It has all the indirection you would expect of a defiant film maker whose work must pass Government censors and film boards (for years they rejected the idea for ''Man of Marble''), all the accomplishment of one adept at portraying the personal drama of history."

1988-02-12T00:00:00Z,"THERE are critics in Britain who have praised Sally Potter's ''Gold Diggers'' as ''witty,'' ''visually entrancing'' and ''an absorbing pleasure,'' and there may also be like-minded individuals on the planet Jupiter. But by any reasonable earthly standard, this thing - a 1983 oddity, sort of a feminist, deconstructionist, riddle-filled anti-musical, much of it set on the Icelandic tundra - is pure torture. Its only noteworthy attribute is the presence of Julie Christie, who embodies some sardonic notion of the archetypical unenlightened movie heroine through the ages. Like it or not, Miss Christie is infinitely better off playing such creatures straight than she is satirizing them here. ''The Gold Diggers,'' which opens today at the Thalia SoHo, begins with a black woman (Colette Laffont) and a white one (Miss Christie) outlining a vexing riddle (''Only in the darkness am I visible. You can see me but never touch me. I can speak to you but never hear you . . . who am I?''). One of them then maintains that since there are only 90 minutes to find an answer, ''Time is short.'' This is laughable, under the circumstances. The camera goes on to explore a plotless configuration of bare Arctic landscapes, mock silent-movie scenes and caricatures of masculine behavior, and never has the clock moved more slowly. There is also about a 15-minute encounter between Miss Christie and a tap-dancing mime."

The area that fostered Blondie, Velvet Underground and Television supports groups that push rock forms to their limits.

Apart from being artists in the entertainment sense, they have also played artists in the artistic sense. And as Hollywood and the New York art world move closer together in the 1980's - with their star systems, the big prices and instant fame that awaits hot new discoveries - Hollywood has started to take the art world seriously (or humorously, as the case may be)."
