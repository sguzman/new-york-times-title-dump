On rainy days, on the beach, before going to sleep, I journeyed through dependent clauses, I swam in syntax. The trouble was that when I finished I was talking in these rhythms.

Congressmen and commentators, the expert and the influential, public opinion and the press, all now play significantly greater roles in foreign affairs decision making than they did during my years in the White House.

There's a foot injury that will heal only when he retires, and some of the sting may have gone from Jimmy Connors's racquet as well.

However, I would like to suggest to Mr. Dana that the problems of isolation and lack of support may lie more with the poets than the culture.

1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: DELFT stands for blue and white pottery; in fact the whole town positively hymns the blues.

1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: THE loud sound emanating from Mexico last week was that of a monolith shattering. After nearly 60 years of virtually unchallenged one-party rule, the Institutional Revolutionary Party was introduced to competitive politics and immediately found the results not entirely to its liking."

1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: ''The street is a room by agreement,'' the great architect Louis Kahn said many years ago. In his characteristically poetic manner, Kahn was stating perhaps the most important truth about the design of cities: that there is a kind of social contract involved in the making of a well-designed city, a tacit understanding that buildings be placed so as to make a coherent whole."

1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: History has never been easy for the French. It has, for them, probably more than for any other European people, produced a mix of exultation and anguish. Ninety-nine years ago, the French celebrated the 100th anniversary of the beginning of their great Revolution of 1789, and, by a rather extraordinary coincidence, they did so only a couple of years after inaugurating for the first time a permanently republican form of government, finishing a century-long alternation between monarchy and anarchy."

1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Nobody asks why students would want to have contemporary works taught in class. Teaching - explanation -has in the past been reserved for less accessible, noncontemporary works. Why not let students discover the world they live in by themselves? Are we teachers so desperate to direct them every step of the way?"
1988-07-10T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The main question to ask about the Georges Braque exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is not whether it is good or bad but whether it should be taking place at all. It is something of a retrospective, with around 120 works, 90 of them paintings.
