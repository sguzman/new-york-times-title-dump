But it finishes with mellow smoothness. At 56 proof, it is stronger than many liqueurs. Canton was developed by John Cooper, whose father, N. J.

2007-08-24T00:00:00Z,"An article and headline on July 23 about a new Israeli third-grade textbook referred imprecisely to the way it described the 1948-49 war with Arab countries that followed Israel's declaration of independence. The textbook said that Arabs view the war as a catastrophe; it did not say that the war was a catastrophe for the Arab population or that the establishment of Israel was a catastrophe for the Palestinians. The Times, which did not have a copy of the textbook when the article was published, attributed the descriptions of what the book said to the Israeli Education Ministry. The text, translated from the Hebrew, says in a passage about the war: ''Arabs call this war the Nakba'' (which means catastrophe) ''whereas the Jewish people call it the War of Independence.'' This correction was delayed to get a copy of the book."
2007-08-24T00:00:00Z,"REVENGE OF THE BOOKEATERS Whether they always finished their own homework is debatable, but on Sunday evening a Who's Who of downtown comedy stars, writers and indie rockers will perform in a benefit show for 826NYC, the free tutoring center for children in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Among those scheduled to appear are Feist, the indie chanteuse known for her magpie vocal style, who will do a reading; Britt Daniel, the singer of the Austin, Tex., band Spoon; A. C. Newman, the newlywed leader of the New Pornographers, the Canada-by-way-of-Brooklyn musical collective; the lo-fi local quartet Grizzly Bear; and the comedians Leo Allen, Eugene Mirman and the host, Demetri Martin. (The indie-rocker Sufjan Stevens, above, performed at last year's program.) Most of them do not volunteer at the center, which was founded in 2004 by the writer Dave Eggers and others. (It's located behind the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company, a storefront lure for local children, and as many as 200 come in weekly for writing help.) Aside from a fondness for one another, what unites this crew? ''Is it bragging to say that everybody's pretty smart?'' said Sarah Vowell, the writer and also president and chief cheerleader for 826NYC. ''Demetri Martin -- it's not hyperbole to say that he's probably the best comic ever to make jokes about palindromes. Even with the musicians there's a kind of reverence for words and language that has a natural affinity for the cause,'' said Ms. Vowell, who helped corral the guests and will also perform. ''They're not eggheads. There's an unpretentious, joshing charm about a lot of them.''"

2007-08-24T00:00:00Z,"BILL DOUGLAS RETROSPECTIVE As a child growing up in a small mining village in Scotland, the filmmaker Bill Douglas suffered hunger, abandonment and extreme poverty. Through years of neglect and loneliness he would escape to the local cinema, paying his admission by redeeming empty jam jars. The deprivations of those years, and his eventual deliverance, were the inspiration for three of Mr. Douglas's four films, a trilogy of remarkable simplicity and emotional resonance. Ferociously unsentimental, it is the work of a man forced to grow up on only imagination and hope. Set in 1945, ''My Childhood'' (1972), the first installment, follows young Jamie (Stephen Archibald) as he learns that his mother has been confined to an asylum and his father is a man who lives a few houses away. With a near-silent maternal grandmother and a distant half-brother as his only companions, Jamie forms a touching attachment to a German P.O.W. In ''My Ain Folk'' (1973), Jamie has moved in with his paternal grandmother (Jean Taylor Smith, above right, with Mr. Archibald), a cruel woman who blames Jamie's mother for ruining her son's life. Filled with death and departure, this segment of the trilogy is the most devastating, as a bereft Jamie is finally consigned to a children's home in Edinburgh. Ending on a hopeful note, ''My Way Home'' (1978) brings Jamie, via National Service in the Royal Air Force, to Egypt and to a friendship that will alter the course of his life."

2007-08-24T00:00:00Z,"'ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER: BERLIN STREET SCENE' There are many reasons to visit this small if delightful collection exhibition at the Neue Galerie on the Upper East Side, not least of which is a chance to acquaint yourself with a new acquisition: Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's ''Berlin Street Scene'' (1913-14), above, bought at auction last November for $38 million. It also happens to be a terrific painting and a high point of early German Expressionism. And the subject matter? It depicts a pair of ladies soliciting customers along a busy Berlin avenue. Their illicit occupation is beyond doubt: their calcium-white faces, rouge lips, feathered hats and fitted gowns are telltale signs, though it is interesting to note that the models for the women in the painting were Erna and Gerda Schilling, sisters and dancers at a Berlin nightclub. But what gives the painting its charged and anxious atmosphere is the effect that the two women are having on the men around them. One of them, at far right, turns his head away in disdain, while another, at left, glances longingly out of one eye. Then there is the central figure with his back to us, who is determined to appear unmoved by their presence. Meanwhile, in the background, a No. 15 bus pauses to make a stop at the edge of the crowd. The number is significant, for according to the exhibition catalog the No. 15 streetcar serviced the red-light district in Berlin.

2007-08-25T00:00:00Z,"After just one night of the new reality series ''Anchorwoman,'' the Fox network had seen enough, canceling it as soon as the dismal ratings came in. The show, which followed the efforts of a former swimsuit model, Lauren Jones, right, to become a news anchor at a television station in Texas, pulled in only 2.7 million viewers. Preston Beckman, the executive in charge of scheduling for Fox, said in a telephone interview yesterday, ''We're getting close to the start of the fall season and this is not a time for us to allow our circulation to be going down.'' Fox has won every week of the summer in the ratings for viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the competition that Fox, ABC and NBC all use to determine the ratings winner. But that streak will come to an end when this week's numbers are calculated, Mr. Beckman said. Last week Fox broadcast the finales of its two biggest summer hits, ''Hell's Kitchen'' and ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' If it had somehow managed to match the success of those other reality shows with ''Anchorwoman,'' the network might have been able to keep that streak going. But Fox executives never expected it to, and the show underperformed their modest expectations, Mr. Beckman said. He added that Fox had produced only five half-hour episodes of ''Anchorwoman'' and used two of them Wednesday night."

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"In its uniquely intimate look at a long-term couples-therapy group, Laurie Abraham’s article (Aug. 12) demonstrates that truly committing to a process of finding out (with an excellent therapist) what will make a marriage better, and sticking with it, no matter how long it takes, could at the very least improve relationships and, in many cases, save marriages. How unfortunate that this form of therapy is largely available only to upper-income couples. Most marriage counseling is not covered by insurance, despite the fact that troubled marriages may lead to depression, anxiety and substance abuse, which can result in lost productivity and high additional health-care costs, to say nothing of divorce and its impact on children. The current in-vogue therapy, largely dictated by what insurance companies will and will not cover, is short-term cognitive behavioral therapy. This would not have repaired the 22-year marriage of Clem and Marie, nor is it likely to have much impact on long-ingrained dysfunctional patterns of behavior and communication in marriages that usually stem from each spouse’s unresolved family-of-origin issues."

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Hugh Johnson, a serious if eccentric wine writer, did a delightful pop-up book years ago about hosting a fantasy dinner. Since it was his fantasy, he had dibs on the guests and the wines, and so entertained Napoleon, Sir Winston Churchill and other high-ranking poobahs. The Samurai Sipper has often fantasized similarly, only I'd pass on Thomas Jefferson an d have Edie Falco over for a post-Carmela henfest instead. I'd toy with serving a pinot grigio from Lorraine Bracco's vineyards in Italy, but would decide that's overkill. A 2003 Rosso del Soprano from Astor Wines and Spirits, 399 Lafayette Street, is hardly subtle. Still, Edie might be struck by the wine's wild grapes, grown since antiquity in Messina, and by my $150,000 Steinway & Sons Model D music system, which didn't fall off a truck."

At Equinox on Broadway and 19th Street, we stand in rows facing a mirror, eyes trained on our wooden swords as well as on our leader, Ilaria Montagnani. Moving to the beat of music that sounds like rhythmic jackhammering, we squat, lunge, slice and slash. The class is called Forza. The footwork is simple, and there are only 13 sword moves. The difficulty comes in making each cut precise, putting the whole body behind the swing and controlling the stick."

Coming to you live from the Siren Music Festival at Coney Island, the TV on the Radio concert at the McCarren Park Pool in Williamsburg and P.S. 1's annual summer Warm Up in Long Island City, where the personal style quotient was so off the charts that it practically raises the question: Who needs fashion?"
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"When Harvey Weinstein announced this spring that he was going into the dress business, a couple of magazines made a fuss, but for the most part the fashion people treated him exactly as they would any newcomer. They regarded him with surprise and suspicion. It makes no difference that Weinstein is a successful producer of movies (he and his brother, Bob, started Miramax Films) and that those movies defied all kinds of conventions to win a total of 45 Oscars. Nor is there anything about his person that would send a fashion editor up the wall. He is polite, gregarious, at times charming. None of the bad faults for which he is legendary in Hollywood -- the screaming, the harassing -- are on display in fashion circles. And maybe it is for that reason that something about the sight of this bearish hetero sitting among the thin, knowing fashionistas compels sympathy as much as bemusement. Instead of getting in someone's face, Weinstein, in this environment, has the companionable air of a man holding out his mitts so his wife can unwind her knitting yarn."

That muted hues are easier to apply and more flattering is accepted style wisdom. The innovators at M.A.C. hope you will forget this wisdom when their new C Shock collection hits shelves, with nary a taupe eye shadow. Taking a cue from the runways -- the models' eyes at Alexander McQueen were rimmed in acid green -- C Shock includes a range of eye makeup in aqua with green pearl, soft lemon yellow, and royal blue with pink pearl.

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"At the fall shows, the catwalks reverberatedwith the sound of stomping boots as Dr. Martens -- those Humvees of footwear and artifacts of a million misspent youths -- enjoyed a fashion moment. Yohji Yamamoto spearheaded the return, collaborating with the brand to create a limited-edition line; chunky lace-up boots also lent a subversive edge to feminine frocks at Chloé. When the German doctor Klaus Maertens made his first cushion-soled boot in 1945 -- to support an ankle he'd injured skiing -- he could never have imagined that his orthopedic innovation would evolve into an enduring symbol of youthful rebellion. The iconic brand's rise began in 1960, after R. Griggs and Co. Ltd. secured the rights to manufacture the Air Cushion Sole in England. With a newly Anglicized name, the eight-hole, cherry-red boot was launched as a work shoe. This proletarian association, and the fact that the steel safety toe could double as a deadly weapon, made it a part of the skinhead uniform. For the next three decades, ''Docs'' were worn by successive style tribes, their meaning subtly evolving with each new appropriation. While rude girls had been wearing Docs since the 1970s, it was not until the early '90s that women truly claimed them as their own. Riot-grrrl bands like Bikini Kill and their fans rejected high heels as ''phallicizing'' tools of the patriarchy. Instead they juxtaposed Dr. Martens' implicit symbolism of machismo and violence with torn baby-doll dresses, becoming at once the date-raped prom queen and her defiler. Over time the original outrage of this uniform was repackaged as a fun look sold at the mall, and it was left to the lesbian community to keep alive the radical spirit of ''chicks with Docs.'' Whether the recent catwalk sightings of Dr. Martens marks a reawakening of a feminist fashion consciousness is doubtful. But given the choice between the riot-grrrls' growl and the inane purring and pole scratching of the Pussycat Dolls, maybe it's time for women to strap on their boots."

Yet he makes the differences seem greater than they are: the loss of one's role in the group among Sri Lankans is not so different from ''diminished interest in activities'' and ''feelings of detachment'' in PTSD. Afghans experienced ''nervous anger'' and ''the mental sensation of internal stress or pressure,'' which are similar to the ''irritability'' and ''hypervigilance'' described in our diagnosis of PTSD.

High-end department stores or drugstores with more quotidian picks carry vast arrays of beauty products designed to baffle and confuse you, or so it seems. Some products offer vague instructions on how to use them; others are shrouded in self-serving dermababble that's best deconstructed by molecular biologists and chemists. Some products are self-explanatory, but provide no clues as to where they fit into your daily routine. When exactly do you use a primer? Should your sunblock be applied before the moisturizer, or does it double as a moisturizer? Does makeup remover clean your face, and why do some cleansers exfoliate?"

The night was hot, but he was wearing, as usual, a dark suit and tie. An outspoken atheist, Saramago maintains that religion is to blame for most of the world's violence.

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Indian women have always gone the distance for beauty. They've had to.

In most places, you're talking waxy lipstick in three cadaverous shades, sold at the general store. But there's a reason, beyond a fortunate gene pool, that India regularly cleans up at the international Miss Strut pageants. Women there have a history of being resourceful, as Sharada Dwivedi and Shalini Devi Holkar explain in ''Almond Eyes, Lotus Feet'' (Collins), a fascinating compendium of traditional beauty and healing remedies spun as the fictional memoir of a princess."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"In reading Alex Kotlowitz's thoughtful article (Aug. 5), I came out with a greater appreciation of the problems Mexican immigrants face in small-town America but with no clearer idea of a solution. They come here at great cost, they work hard and well, they are nice people, by and large, and ask nothing more than to live among us and pay their own way. But with their apparent disinclination to learn English, they seem to care little about blending in to America's nebulous but fairly welcoming culture. Do we have a right to expect this of them, or they of themselves, given the long, ill-paid hours they labor? In my opinion we do, as do they. Fluency in language, perhaps more than anything else, could give them and us the understanding and acceptance they deserve, and that we can hardly afford to lose. It could help them become committed Americans, as it has for every other immigrant group. This is why we and they must make a greater effort, formally and informally, to encourage this process."

I hope that you will soon give the same sort of sympathetic attention to the women who are providing these eggs. What is it like to undergo the grueling egg-retrieval process in exchange for a check? How thoroughly are these women being informed of the risks they are taking -- including, as Orenstein briefly mentions, the possibility of adverse reactions requiring hospitalization and a small chance of death? Are they being told just how inadequate are the existing data about short-term and long-term risks? Who is recruiting them and profiting from the exchange? Orenstein's article concludes with the happiness of an egg-recipient mother-to-be, looking forward to building her family ''regardless of whose genes are involved.'' Until we consider the women who are providing the eggs that carry those genes, that rosy wrap-up seems premature."

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Chris Benz may be originally from Seattle, but don't expect his customers to rock out in lumberjack flannels or defaced denim. ''I like the ease and recklessness of grunge, but I'm not into holes,'' says the 24-year-old Parsons graduate (top), who was awarded a Council of Fashion Designers of America scholarship before interning for Marc Jacobs and working for J. Crew. His debut collection (go to www.chris-benz.com) was inspired by old-school glamour: the jazz-era shirtdresses, mohair jackets, mink jockey caps and twill jodhpurs had a flapper-meets-slacker vibe that never seemed stagey. ''I'll do slouchy pants with low belt loops and a wallet chain for a tomboy look,'' he says. ''But I'm just as likely to put a chiffon flower on a blouse that Jordan Baker might have worn in 'The Great Gatsby.' '' He says his historical eclectism comes from a childhood spent rummaging through his grandmother's attic. Cedar chips and old clothes? Just don't call it grunge."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"These are good times for design -- and for designers. They can go the functional route, turning out plastic stacking chairs and sectional sofas that sell by the truckload, or they can go the design-art route, creating limited-edition pieces that are sometimes sublime and sometimes ridiculous. Or they can do both, and no one will accuse them of selling out. And between the limitless possibilities of design art and technological innovations, functional doesn't preclude fanciful. There has probably never been so much good stuff out there to buy. And yet. It isn't easy to find objects that solve an actual problem and make you swoon at the same time. So a small exhibition of prototypes by the French designer Inga Sempé was one of the stealth highlights of Milan Furniture Fair week. I say stealth not because Sempé is unknown: her Chantilly sofa for Edra, a lush, almost louche creation covered in gathered jewel-toned satins and striped silks, was one of the high-profile hits of the fair."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Fashion birthdays used to be momentous events, celebrated only when major landmarks came around. These days, it seems there's a party every time a designer successfully threads a needle. With that in mind, can you tell the real anniversaries from the decoys?"

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"The latest celebrity to feed the public's appetite for a taste -- should we say spritz? -- of stardom is Prince, the landmark artist and producer, who doesn't take a picture unless he's paid. His 3121 fragrance shares the same name as his No. 1 album. The fact that the scent is overtly sensual, with warm notes of patchouli and cedarwood mingling with brighter ones of bergamot and orange flower, comes as no big surprise from a man who has worn butt-less pants."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Your readers may have gained an incomplete picture of just how successful Thom Mayne's Lawrence House (now owned by Beth Harris) was in fulfilling his design aesthetic (Pilar Viladas, July 1). Mayne has published extensively on incorporating ''conflict'' into his structures. He truly achieved his goal. As a former co-owner of this structure, I found that its reflective surfaces and lack of demarcation of full rooms and the Escher-like tight stairways truly made this a house of torture -- and one that certainly helped contribute to my separation from my wife."

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"Another school year, another round of controversy about religion in public education. This fall, two new yet already divisive publicly financed schools are set to open: the Khalil Gibran International Academy in Brooklyn and the Ben Gamla Charter School in Hollywood, Fla. Both describe themselves as nonsectarian institutions that emphasize a particular language -- Arabic and Hebrew, respectively -- and both have been criticized on the assumption that they will be organized around the distinctive cultures (and thus religions) associated with those languages. Meanwhile, at the University of Michigan at Dearborn, a small firestorm has erupted over plans to install foot baths in school washrooms to help Muslim students perform the ablutions required for daily prayer."

A cormorant was fishing in the sparkling waters of the Great South Bay. Ira, my partner, was beside me, blissfully taking the sun."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"It was Aug. 24, 2005, and New Orleans was still charming. Tropical Depression 12 was spinning from the Bahamas toward Florida, but the chances of an American city's being destroyed by nature were remote, even for one below sea level. An entire industry of weather bookies -- scientists who calculate the likelihood of various natural disasters -- had in effect set the odds: a storm that destroys $70 billion of insured property should strike the United States only once every 100 years. New Orleanians had made an art form of ignoring threats far more likely than this; indeed, their carelessness was a big reason they were supposedly more charming than other Americans. And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American. From Miami to San Francisco, the nation's priciest real estate now faced beaches and straddled fault lines; its most vibrant cities occupied its most hazardous land. If, after World War II, you had set out to redistribute wealth to maximize the sums that might be lost to nature, you couldn't have done much better than Americans had done. And virtually no one -- not even the weather bookies -- fully understood the true odds."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"In 1964, a 3-year-old girl named Laudomia was unhappily confined to her sickbed. It was, as these things go, not a bad place to be confined; her bedroom was on the third floor of the Palazzo Pucci, a massive 14th-century villa in Florence, just behind the Duomo's pearl-gray immensity. But she was bored and restless, and so, to cheer her up, her father, an Italian aristocrat, brought her some perfume."

Credited with turning Coach into a $2.5 billion accessories powerhouse in 10 years as its president and creative director, Reed Krakoff has a knack for translating his favorite things -- art, cars, travel, architecture -- into status bags that women gobble up like candy. His latest project is even more personal. The Delphine (named after his wife and No. 1 inspiration) epitomizes his modernist aesthetic. Its luxury lies in what's missing. ''There's nothing to hide behind,'' Krakoff says. ''It's organic yet disciplined, as the shape and balance had to be perfect in order for it to register.''"

The Rev. Chan-Hie Kim performed the ceremony at Westwood United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. The bride, 30, is taking her husband's name. She is a staff dermatologist at two group practices, Indianer, Lask & Rosenzweig in Encino, Calif., and Skin Physicians & Surgeons in Upland, Calif.

2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"As someone who has been treated for and recovered from PTSD, I am acutely aware that the symptoms I experienced during the worst times of my trauma and recovery were acutely American. It disturbs me that we are actively selling a Western version of trauma and the route to recovery with a blind eye to the unique cultural expressions of suffering elsewhere in the world. Some observers of PTSD have also noted that the symptoms of the disorder even in the United States have changed and evolved with time. For example, the trauma symptoms displayed by veterans of World War I differed from the symptoms suffered by World War II veterans."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"If names like Walter Albini, Ted Lapidus, Krizia and Guy Laroche don't send you sprinting to your favorite vintage dealer, it's time to bone up on your fashion history. By referencing the labels that epitomized European elegance 30 years ago, designers are reliving the golden age of pret-à-porter -- that heady era when dressing down meant settling for tights and Charles Jourdan sandals rather than fishnets and Maud Frizon pumps."
2007-08-26T00:00:00Z,"In its uniquely intimate look at a long-term couples-therapy group, Laurie Abraham's article (Aug. 12) demonstrates that truly committing to a process of finding out (with an excellent therapist) what will make a marriage better, and sticking with it, no matter how long it takes, could at the very least improve relationships and, in many cases, save marriages. How unfortunate that this form of therapy is largely available only to upper-income couples. Most marriage counseling is not covered by insurance, despite the fact that troubled marriages may lead to depression, anxiety and substance abuse, which can result in lost productivity and high additional health-care costs, to say nothing of divorce and its impact on children. The current in-vogue therapy, largely dictated by what insurance companies will and will not cover, is short-term cognitive behavioral therapy. This would not have repaired the 22-year marriage of Clem and Marie, nor is it likely to have much impact on long-ingrained dysfunctional patterns of behavior and communication in marriages that usually stem from each spouse's unresolved family-of-origin issues."

Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans' Court to rescind his permission for the financially troubled foundation to move Albert Barnes's art collection to Philadelphia from its original home in Merion, Pa. The group asked the court to examine possible new sources of revenue that could offset the Barnes's $1.2 million deficit, including a $107 million allocation in the Pennsylvania State capital budget to finance the move; a new regulation permitting the museum in Merion to have 144,000 visitors a year, up from 62,000; and a proposed $50 million bond issue to provide an endowment. The petition also asked that the board of directors be removed and the foundation placed in receivership. ''What we're hoping is, by bringing new information and old information to the judge's attention, the court may be persuaded to reopen the case,'' said Walter Herman, a spokesman for the Friends of the Barnes, a group formed in 2004 to keep the collection from leaving the building where Mr. Barnes had installed it.

The owl and pussycat from the Edward Lear poem and two pairs of Aesop characters -- the tortoise and the hare, and the lion and the mouse -- have their tales printed on the colorful boxes of eight cookies. Two by Two Animal Biscuits are made by Artisan Biscuits in Derbyshire, England, with just flour, butter, sugar and simple flavoring agents like fruit juice or vanilla and do not taste like packaged cookies. They are $3.79 a box at Gourmet Garage stores and $4.95 at Blue Apron in Park Slope, Brooklyn. It's a simple concept to shove a tubelike gadget into an orange and squeeze the juice out through it. Now there is a particularly efficient plastic version, also made in England and designed for children. Called the Juiceator, it offers a lunchbox alternative to heavily sweetened juice box drinks. It's recommended for children 4 and up. (Some younger ones might need help from an adult inserting it into the fruit, but sucking out the juice through the straw at the end will be no challenge.) Hikers, too, might welcome it in their backpacks, with a few oranges that become biodegradable discards. Four Juiceators are $19.95, plus $6.95 shipping, from juiceatorusa.com."

2007-08-31T00:00:00Z,"ONEIDA There's something about Oneida's music that seems as if it could go on forever. Maybe it's that dissonant organ, pounding a few chords over and over in long, throbbing noise-drones. Or maybe it's the vocals, chanted as if part of some ceremony from rock 'n' roll's tribal prehistory. It could be the drums, fast and strong and unrelenting. Whatever it is, Oneida has been bashing it out for 10 years now as the consummate Brooklyn avant-rock band, weird enough to play a single riff for 14 minutes, as it did on ''Sheets of Easter,'' from its 2002 double album, ''Each One Teach One'' (Jagjaguwar), yet enough of a meat-and-potatoes rock outfit to have clear stylistic connections to the MC5 and Led Zeppelin. Over the last decade it has been easy to take Oneida for granted, as the band -- above, from left, Hanoi Jane, Kid Millions and Fat Bobby -- has played countless club shows and parties, remaining a local favorite even as other Brooklyn groups like its onetime opening act the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have gone on to national prominence. But at P.S. 1 in Queens tomorrow Oneida makes an elder-statesman gesture by playing a 10th-anniversary show, supported by friends like Sightings, Ex-Models and Dirty Faces.

But the company was selling it at bn.com, where advance orders propelled the book as high as No. 1 on its best-seller list. (Yesterday it had fallen to No. 17.) The company has ''concluded that enough customers have expressed interest in buying the book to warrant stocking it in our stores,'' Ms. Keating said.

This year the festival is honoring five troupes that have reached the 10-year mark; such longevity, along with baseball pitchers who can make it out of the sixth inning, is becoming an increasing rarity in these economically trying times. The troupes -- David Parker and the Bang Group, Brian Brooks Moving Company, nicholasleichterdance, Gina Gibney Dance and Young Dance Makers -- will each perform a dance from 1997, and a new work commissioned by the festival. DancenOw takes a grab-bag approach to programming, but some eye-catching names include the irrepressible portraitist Larry Keigwin, the Stephen Petronio Company alumna Jimena Paz and the Butoh-inspired Vangeline Theater, which, along with Ms. Paz and others, will perform site-specific gallery dances during the festival.

It is an unorthodox partnership, though there is something immensely appealing about the idea of experimental art invading this sterile corporate environment. A handful of the artworks even poke fun at corporate culture and greed, including Ana Prvacki's mock money-laundering service (complete with a promotional video); the Dutch collective Bik Van der Pol's installation inspired by an out-of-print guidebook, ''How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found''; and Lee Walton's hiring of an actor to hang around the gallery's 51st Street entrance for an hour each day, pretending to be an office worker at lunch. Bleachers are provided nearby for viewers in the know. Several pieces invite audience participation, including Surasi Kusolwong's 2007 work ''Ping-Pong (New York Common Sense),'' above, a mirrored Ping-Pong table covered in kitsch figurines; Kianga Ford's white, cocoonlike structures for relaxing and listening to stories on headphones; or Chitra Ganesh and Mariam Ghani's library of chilling -- even sickening -- information on immigration issues, including detentions, deportations and legal battles. Occasionally an office worker stops, sits down and starts reading. At this point the exhibition begins to make sense, sort of: It is about introducing radical, experimental art to new audiences.

2007-09-02T00:00:00Z,"Mark Lilla (Aug. 19) is right to conclude his review of the intertwining of politics and religion by suggesting that instead of trying to make Muslims more like us, we must allow them to draw on the “theological resources within their own traditions” to “create a decent and workable political order.” Although he concedes that within our own tradition this kind of internal reformation was once possible, he believes that today it is not. Instead, we must rely entirely on “our own lucidity,” since religiously inspired hopes for a better world almost always generate violence. But the evidence from the French revolutionary terror to Hiroshima and the Gulag indicates that lucidity (reason?) can be at least as lethal a basis for political life; whereas biblically informed prophets like Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. can still inspire healthy, nonviolent change. The real challenge of Islam to Western intellectual discourse is for us to ask ourselves whether our unprecedented modern experiment of conducting political life with no transcendent values is really working out as well as once hoped, and if it is not, how can we draw on our own traditions, as we hope the Muslims draw on theirs, to craft a viable way to live together?."

His artistic talents led him to teaching art in New Rochelle for over 25 years before changing course in his mid1950s to obtain his Master's in Social Work from Fordham, finding his ultimate calling as a psychotherapist. He was friend and counselor to those who found trust, healing and acceptance under his care. He helped us find humor in the folly of human behavior, providing many the ability to forgive. May his friendship and guidance live on in our hearts. He is survived by a brother, two nieces, several cousins and a multitude of devoted friends.

He joined BCIU in February 1960 just five years after its creation by President Eisenhower, and continued to advise and mentor the staff of the organization until the final days of his life. Born on September 1, 1927 on a farm in Mingo, Iowa, Charlie enlisted in the U.S. Navy upon his high school graduation, serving in the Pacific and in the post-war Philippines. He returned to the U.S. to study at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. Charlie is remembered as a consummate professional who loved his work and the people from around the world with whom he had contact. His unfailing kindness, gentleness and decency were his signature. He believed it was a special responsibility, and really an honor, to lead BCIU. This dedication and commitment was felt by the many leading U.S. Ambassadors and policymakers who received his support. BCIU's annual Opera Gala at Lincoln Center was inaugurated during his Presidency and its success and growth was a source of great satisfaction to him. Charlie was particularly enthusiastic about this year's October 12th Gala. We consider it to be a special tribute to Charlie's long and dedicated service to the principles of the BCIU.

He arrived in New York in 1972 to pursue his theatre interests where he directed several plays. While pursuing his theatre career, he was introduced to Douglas Durst and the Durst Portfolio. With his experience directing and designing sets he then began new endeavors working for The Durst Organization. Throughout 29 years as Director of Small Residential and Developmental Properties, Shan worked with Douglas and Jody Durst and 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation Durst family members. As the company developed, so did Shan's responsibilities and expertise. His loyalty and quiet determination to successfully accomplish his goals were unmatched. A man of great character and integrity he always extended equal energy and compassion to his colleagues and friends, even through his extended eight year battle with cancer. He lived his life with great dignity and pride and respected all who he came in contact with.

2007-09-02T00:00:00Z,"What Happened in Norfolk? After reading Alan Berlow's article (Aug. 19) about the confessions that were made in the Norfolk rape-murder investigation, including the comments from the interviewed experts about false confessions (how they are typically elicited; state of mind of the confessor), it seems to me that the ability of the investigator to wield the threat of the death penalty dangerously skews the situation. I hope this can be one more piece of evidence as to why the death penalty should be abolished. Certainly a situation can be imagined in which giving a false confession is preferable to the thought of losing one's life. This story demonstrates that the mere legality of the death penalty can facilitate gross miscarriages of justice even when one is not sentenced to its punishment."

He was a student at the Mount Hermon School and later a member of its Board of Trustees. After serving in the U.S. Army at the end of WWII, he continued his education via the GI Bill. He was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1949, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and Yale Law School in 1952, where he was Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale he met his wife of 50 years, Gloria Messinger Mandelstam (Yale Law School 1954), who for 12 years was the CEO of the American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He had a lifelong belief in the rule of the law. His first job was at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Next he went to Kaye Scholer, then on for 36 years to the firm that became Dornbush, Mensch, Mandelstam & Schaeffer, of which he was a founder and leader. Finally, he moved to McLaughlin & Stern, where he worked until the last months of his life. He represented filmmakers Fred Wiseman and Michael Roemer; architects including Sam Brody, Lewis Davis, and Philip Johnson; psychoanalysts including Marianna Kris and Anna Freud; and authors including Betty Friedan, Gloria Emerson, and Jane Bryant Quinn. He also represented the Marilyn Monroe estate and the Rubin Museum of Art. He was an expert in complex trusts and estates and represented the Aaron Diamond Foundation and the Samuel Rubin Foundation. On behalf of American clients, he provided financial and strategic support to South African lawyers representing anti-apartheid activists. He sued the United States government on behalf of a number of prominent clients to compel production of FBI and CIA documents under the Freedom of Information Act. His interests were broad and diverse; he was always open to new experiences. An enthusiast of French wine and food, he organized in 1970 and led a group that bought a vineyard in Cote Rotie that became Domaine de Bonserine and produced awardwinning vintages. He was instrumental in establishing the North Salem Open Land Foundation, where he worked tirelessly to conserve the natural beauty of the historic rural town he adopted as his second home. An avid photographer, a lover of classical music, and a passionate collector of Mocha pottery, he became an accomplished folk artist in his seventies.

Never before has so much been up in the air so close to the first vote. Even as the campaigns spent the past few days planning for the unofficial kickoff that comes with Labor Day -- rallies, bus trips, house parties, speeches and the like -- they were struggling with what veteran aides described as the most unsettled landscape they can remember. By yesterday, all the major Democratic candidates said they would not campaign in states that move up their primaries in defiance of party rules -- Florida, and in coming days, possibly Michigan, a late-hour reminder that even the schedule of when states vote remains up in the air for both parties."

2007-09-02T00:00:00Z,"So what did you manage to do this summer? Did you accomplish everything you set out to accomplish back around Memorial Day? Clean your garage? Build a campfire? Paint a wall? Take in a ballgame? Sleep under the stars? If your summer wish list remains unfinished, despair not. You're not alone, as the notes below show. They were gathered by Illegal Art, a collective of artists in New York, which used 6,000 Post-it notes to spell out the words ''To Do'' on windows and billboards across the city. Passers-by were then invited to write on the blank notes, to cover them with descriptions of tasks they hadn't gotten around to this summer. A few of the collected notes appear on today's page, all in their original handwriting -- a catalog of unfinished business, just waiting for fall."

The Chinese-lacquer color is vividly evident in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum's annual installation of 20-foot-long nasturtium vines, right, cascading from the third-floor balconies in the garden. At New York's spring galas, women were seen wearing nasturtium-colored evening dresses. One, top right, resembled the Greco-Roman relief at the Gardner. By June and July, the color had become the season's dominant shade on Fifth Avenue."
2007-09-02T00:00:00Z,"THE ECHO MAKER, by Richard Powers. (Picador, $15.) Powers's ninth novel, a National Book Award winner, is a brilliant exploration of memory and identity. On a remote Nebraska road, 27-year-old Mark Schluter has a near-fatal car accident. Left with a rare kind of amnesia, Mark cannot recall the emotional connections of his life and believes his sister Karin is an impostor. Stung by his rejection, Karin sends a desperate plea to Gerald Weber, an Oliver Sacks-like neurologist whose popular books have come under critical attack. Our reviewer, Colson Whitehead, said Powers's ''scientific discourses point to how the world works, but the struggles of his characters ... help us understand how we work.'' DEATH'S DOOR: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve, by Sandra M. Gilbert. (Norton, $17.95.) Since her husband's death in 1991, Gilbert has written a memoir on the medical misadventures that led to his death, edited an anthology of elegies and collected three volumes of her poems. Drawing on history, literature and contemporary culture -- from the poetry of Walt Whitman to 9/11 -- this book is a sprawling contemplation of mortality and mourning."

The academy is asserting its right to buy the two Pickford statuettes and one owned by her husband, Buddy Rogers (1904-99), for $10, under bylaws dating from 1950 and in accordance with agreements signed by Oscar winners. When Mr. Rogers died, all three Oscars went to his second wife, Beverly, who died in January, leaving them to her heirs, who are co-executors of her estate. Pickford, above, known as America’s Sweetheart, won the Academy Award for best actress for “Coquette” (1929) and was given an honorary Oscar in 1975. Mr. Rogers won the academy’s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1986. The academy said one heir asked it for $500,000 in July for one of the Oscars. David W. Quinto, a lawyer for the academy, said, “If the public believes that any multimillionaire can buy an Oscar, then it becomes cheapened.” A call to John Shevlin, a lawyer for the estate of Beverly Rogers, was not immediately returned."
2007-09-03T00:00:00Z,"Hundreds of Iranians, given a rare chance to hear live Western music, responded enthusiastically to a performance in Tehran last week by the 60-member Osnabrück Symphony Orchestra of Germany, The Associated Press reported. Its female musicians, above, wore headscarves in accordance with Iranian law. “It was wonderful,” said Sharokh Pourmaymin, a young musician, on Thursday, when the orchestra, led by Herman Baeumer, performed Beethoven’s “Leonore” Overture No. 3, Elgar’s Cello Concerto and Brahms’s Fourth Symphony. “I wish it could be repeated with other kinds of music, such as jazz, blues and rock.” Performances of Western music in Iran have been rare since the Islamic revolution in 1979, and in 2005 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad banned state radio from playing it. Last week’s concerts received little press coverage, partly because of a three-day holiday when newspapers were not published. The concerts were part of an exchange that took the Tehran Symphony Orchestra to Osnabrück last year. Nader Mashayekhi, the Osnabrück conductor, said last week’s appearance was so successful that he would play host to a similar event next year."

2007-09-03T00:00:00Z,"Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, has withdrawn his eagerly anticipated new drama from the National Theater in Prague after it refused to allow his wife to play the leading role, The Guardian of London reported. Mr. Havel, right, 70, who retired from the presidency four years ago, maintains that he wrote the play, “Odchazeni” (“Leaving”), for his wife, Dagmar Havlova, and said that if she could not star in it, he would take it to another theater. The play deals with the problems of a former high-ranking politician in surrendering the trappings of power. Although Mr. Havel’s stance has led to accusations that he is being highhanded, he said that he had promised his wife for years that they would collaborate onstage and that she inspired him to write the play. “She was present when I was writing it in the U.S. some months ago,” he said. Referring to the presidency, he said: “She lived alongside me. I wrote it for her. I imagined her being in it.” Ms. Havlova, who called the dispute “undignified and embarrassing,” has independently announced her withdrawal from the production. The National Theater said its policy is not to allow guest actors. The theater’s director, Ondrej Cerny, said, “The National Theater would still like to perform the newest Vaclav Havel drama, and we will try to open new talks.”."

TNT plans to broadcast 23 episodes of the drama this week, although the impending announcement by Mr. Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, prompted NBC to decide to drop “Law & Order” reruns featuring him as of last Saturday. “TNT has no plans to alter its schedule,” said Shirley Powell, a spokeswoman. The equal time rules, requiring broadcasters to provide the same access to opponents when a candidate appears on a broadcast, were written decades ago, and it has never been clear whether the provisions apply to cable, which does not use public airwaves."

2007-09-03T00:00:00Z,"MANDELSTAM--Charles Lawrence, 80, of Manhattan and North Salem, NY, died of leukemia on August 31, 2007. He was born July 6, 1927, in Brookline, MA. He was a student at the Mount Hermon School and later a member of its Board of Trustees. After serving in the U.S. Army at the end of WWII, he continued his education via the GI Bill. He was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1949, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and Yale Law School in 1952, where he was Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale he met his wife of 50 years, Gloria Messinger Mandelstam (Yale Law School 1954), who for 12 years was the CEO of the American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He had a lifelong belief in the rule of the law. His first job was at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Next he went to Kaye Scholer, then on for 36 years to the firm that became Dornbush, Mensch, Mandelstam & Schaeffer, of which he was a founder and leader. Finally, he moved to McLaughlin & Stern, where he worked until the last months of his life. He represented filmmakers Fred Wiseman and Michael Roemer; architects including Sam Brody, Lewis Davis, and Philip Johnson; psychoanalysts including Marianna Kris and Anna Freud; and authors including Betty Friedan, Gloria Emerson, and Jane Bryant Quinn. He also represented the Marilyn Monroe estate and the Rubin Museum of Art. He was an expert in complex trusts and estates and represented the Aaron Diamond Foundation and the Samuel Rubin Foundation. On behalf of American clients, he provided financial and strategic support to South African lawyers representing anti-apartheid activists. He sued the United States government on behalf of a number of prominent clients to compel production of FBI and CIA documents under the Freedom of Information Act. His interests were broad and diverse; he was always open to new experiences. An enthusiast of French wine and food, he organized in 1970 and led a group that bought a vineyard in Cote Rotie that became Domaine de Bonserine and produced awardwinning vintages. He was instrumental in establishing the North Salem Open Land Foundation, where he worked tirelessly to conserve the natural beauty of the historic rural town he adopted as his second home. An avid photographer, a lover of classical music, and a passionate collector of Mocha pottery, he became an accomplished folk artist in his seventies. A wonderfully devoted husband, father, and grandfather, he is survived by his wife; his daughter Emily Mandelstam and son-in-law Paul Engelmayer; his son Peter Mandelstam and daughter-in-law Dawn Drzal; and three grandchildren, Caroline and William Engelmayer and Andrew Mandelstam. He also leaves scores of loving and admiring friends. Services will be held on Tuesday, September 4th at 1:30 pm at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street.

Mr. Romney had been going after Senator John McCain's record on this front, but now Mr. McCain, of Arizona, appears to have been so badly damaged by his fund-raising woes and backlash over his support of the immigration bill in Congress that Mr. Giuliani may be a more inviting target."

2007-09-04T00:00:00Z,"MANDELSTAM--Charles Lawrence , 80, of Manhattan and North Salem, NY, died of leukemia on August 31, 2007. He was born July 6, 1927, in Brookline, MA. He was a student at the Mount Hermon School and later a member of its Board of Trustees. After serving in the U.S. Army at the end of WWII, he continued his education via the GI Bill. He was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1949, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and Yale Law School in 1952, where he was Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale he met his wife of 50 years, Gloria Messinger Mandelstam (Yale Law School 1954), who for 12 years was the CEO of the American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He had a lifelong belief in the rule of the law. His first job was at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Next he went to Kaye Scholer, then on for 36 years to the firm that became Dornbush, Mensch, Mandelstam & Schaeffer, of which he was a founder and leader. Finally, he moved to McLaughlin & Stern, where he worked until the last months of his life. He represented filmmakers Fred Wiseman and Michael Roemer; architects including Sam Brody, Lewis Davis, and Philip Johnson; psychoanalysts including Marianna Kris and Anna Freud; and authors including Betty Friedan, Gloria Emerson, and Jane Bryant Quinn. He also represented the Marilyn Monroe estate and the Rubin Museum of Art. He was an expert in complex trusts and estates and represented the Aaron Diamond Foundation and the Samuel Rubin Foundation. On behalf of American clients, he provided financial and strategic support to South African lawyers representing anti-apartheid activists. He sued the United States government on behalf of a number of prominent clients to compel production of FBI and CIA documents under the Freedom of Information Act. His interests were broad and diverse; he was always open to new experiences. An enthusiast of French wine and food, he organized in 1970 and led a group that bought a vineyard in Cote Rotie that became Domaine de Bonserine and produced awardwinning vintages. He was instrumental in establishing the North Salem Open Land Foundation, where he worked tirelessly to conserve the natural beauty of the historic rural town he adopted as his second home. An avid photographer, a lover of classical music, and a passionate collector of Mocha pottery, he became an accomplished folk artist in his seventies. A wonderfully devoted husband, father, and grandfather, he is survived by his wife; his daughter Emily Mandelstam and son-in-law Paul Engelmayer; his son Peter Mandelstam and daughter-in-law Dawn Drzal; and three grandchildren, Caroline and William Engelmayer and Andrew Mandelstam.

Since the A.P. poll expanded to 25 teams in 1989, no team has taken a bigger tumble in one week. After an opening weekend filled with blowouts and highlighted by visiting Appalachian State’s 34-32 upset of Michigan, there was little notable movement in the Top 25 other than the Wolverines. Southern California was voted No. 1 by the media panel, but the Trojans lost some support. U.S.C. received 62 first-place votes in the preseason poll.

A federal court lifted the hospital company’s Chapter 11 status and approved a new financial plan on Friday, St. Vincent said. The move came as St. Vincent, which operates a hospital in Greenwich Village, a psychiatric hospital in Westchester County and several nursing centers, was preparing to open a new hospital in Manhattan, across the street from its Greenwich Village campus.

But it found that part of the law that lengthened his sentence as a persistent dangerous offender was unconstitutional because it called for the judge, not the jury, to make that determination.

The others would permit prosecutors to seek additional penalties from those convicted of public corruption, make it a crime to knowingly misuse taxpayer dollars or property, and make legislative voting records available online. The ban on dual office-holding, as it is commonly known in New Jersey, does not apply to the 17 legislators or to the numerous local officials who already hold two or more positions.

2007-09-05T00:00:00Z,"SCHWARTZ--Hilton, of Westport, CT, died unexpectedly on September 3 after a short illness. He was married to Micki Schwartz for over 60 years. Tennis was a lifetime passion from his early years, playing with his cousin Herbert Abrams in the Bronx, where both men were born and schooled through high school. Hilton graduated from NYU with a degree in Electrical Engineering, and had been a Captain in the Army Air Corps during WWII. With his brother-in-law, Morton Semel, Hilton developed and owned the Westport Tennis Club. In 1969 he and two partners established Joremi Enterprises, a real estate firm in New York. Though partially retired, he remained actively involved in both businesses until shortly before his death. Throughout his life he was a fine athlete, an active and vigorous tennis player. He later developed an equal enthusiasm for the challenge of golf. A dignified, sharply intelligent man, he was passionately committed to progressive political causes and many healthcare charities, all of which benefited from his financial support. While his death leaves a deep void in their hearts, Hilton's generous, supportive spirit will thrive in those closest to him: his wife Micki; his three children and their spouses, Donna and Dean Trindle, Evan Schwartz and Bob Fitterman, and Ellen and Emmanuel Dupuy dAngeac; his grandchildren Elissa, Brooke, Oscar, Marcel and Elsa; his brother Budd Schwartz; his sister-inlaw Sandra Semel; Herbert and Mildred Abrams; and friends and relatives from his long, full life.

She was universally admired for her ability to manage their professional life, personnel life, and simultaneously raise six children in their Hackensack and Sparta homes. Her family always came first. She instilled in them her joy for living and appreciation for the arts and was a best friend, guardian and protector to her husband and children. She was able to tap into and nourish her spouses and each of her children's talents and never once allowed her unfaltering love to go unspoken or undemonstrated, a tradition she continued with her grandchildren. Her style and disarming wit belied a quiet strength, and unselfish dedication to others. Helen loved ballroom dancing, was a gracious hostess, and very accomplished at the piano, needlework, and cooking.

Fittingly, this husband-and-wife team saw the solution in marriage: Ms. Cruz's 41-year union with Pedro Knight, a trumpeter who almost always accompanied her onstage. ''They met on the day she auditioned for the same band he was in,'' said Ms. Rivera, whose work includes ''La Gringa,'' coming to Repertorio Español in the fall. The show, in previews at New World Stages, opens with an ill Mr. Knight recalling his wife, including her 15 years of stardom in Cuba and their escape after the rise of Castro. In the title role, Xiomara Laugart Sánchez (above), opposite Modesto Lacen as her husband, interprets Ms. Cruz's best-known songs."

She performed ''I'm a Slave 4 U'' with a seven-foot albino python around her neck in 2001. Two years later, she and Madonnajoined in an open-mouth kiss -- in the show's first act.

2007-09-07T00:00:00Z,"CAST PHOTO REVEALS 'PRISON BREAK' ABSENCE When a television show has accumulated as large a body count as ''Prison Break'' has over its first two seasons, any hint that a character might be facing doom is likely to be noticed by fans. So last month, when Fox started rolling out publicity for the third season, chatter grew on television Web sites about the fate of Dr. Sara Tancredi, the character played by Sarah Wayne Callies (above, in character), who is missing from the group photos of the cast being distributed by the network. Dr. Tancredi, a former addict, is the prison physician who helped the show's protagonists, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), and his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), escape in the first season and stay on the lam in the second. (Stop reading here if you do not want to know her fate.) Ms. Callies revealed she was pregnant at the end of last season, with the baby due in August. The third season of ''Prison Break'' was to start shooting by then, so the producers used a body double for her in the first few episodes. Todd Adair, a Fox spokesman, explained that a double was used because the timeline progressed only a couple of months over the first two seasons and there was no way to incorporate Ms. Callies's pregnancy into the story line. Mr. Adair declined to comment about whether Ms. Callies might reappear, and a spokeswoman for the actress did not return phone calls to comment, but a person involved in the show confirmed that Ms. Callies has decided not to return after giving birth.

2007-09-07T00:00:00Z,"'KOHEI YOSHIYUKI: THE PARK' It is hard to characterize this unusual exhibition of black-and-white photographs from the 1970s by the Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki. Basically they are snapshots, taken in Tokyo parks at night using a 35-millimeter camera, infrared film and flash to document the people gathered for amorous trysts, as well as -- and this is the bizarre part -- the hordes of spectators hiding in the bushes who watched, and sometimes even participated in, the action. The three dozen images at Yossi Milo Gallery in Chelsea show more or less equal numbers of heterosexual and homosexual couplings, but they are not simply about sex or even the social strictures of Japanese society at a time when loving couples were forced into the park. They are about the guilty, if electric, pleasure of voyeurism, which drew people to these lonely locales all those years ago and draws us to Mr. Yoshiyuki's photographs, which by and large are not terribly well composed or printed. Several pictures are slightly out of focus, and at times movement blurs the figures. But somehow it all adds to the allure, giving them a grainy realism. We delight in the naughty, clandestine quality of the imagery, viewed in safety from another time and place. But the experience is no less engrossing. (Through Oct. 20, Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, 212-414-0370, www.yossimilo.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO"

2007-09-07T00:00:00Z,"'SESSUE HAYAKAWA: EAST AND WEST, WHEN THE TWAIN MET' The American silent film industry wasn't a particularly hospitable place for Asian and black actors, who were cast mostly in supporting roles or as villains. The taboo, of course, was interracial sex (''Birth of a Nation,'' anyone?) and even interracial sex appeal. All the more remarkable, then, was the singular career of Sessue Hayakawa, the subject of this series at the Museum of Modern Art, which affords an extremely rare opportunity to see 16 Hayakawa films: 14 silents and two talkies (including ''The Bridge Over the River Kwai,'' from 1957, for which he received an Oscar nomination). Broodingly handsome, with an athlete's physique and agility, Hayakawa, born in Chiba, Japan, wasn't always the romantic lead. He played his share of bad guys and also his share of non-Japanese. In this series alone he is an Indian rebel leader, an Arab donkey tender, an American Indian, a Chinese Tong warrior and, in ''The Cheat'' (above), the 1915 film that made him a star, a Burmese ivory trader. Directed by Cecil B. DeMille and beautifully photographed by Alvin Wyckoff, ''The Cheat'' chugs right along, a model of streamlined silent storytelling. It has its racist elements, suggesting that the ivory trader's civilized veneer -- his spiffy suits and suave ladykiller manners -- hides a sadistic depravity: In the most eye-popping, sensationalist scene he burns a brand onto the white heroine's back. But it also shows off Hayakawa's intensity and skill as an actor."

As a young Foreign Service officer serving as a district advisor in South Vietnam's delta region in 1970, I was struck by the regular visits by midgrade officers from Saigon who came to reassure my military colleagues that their service in MACV (the military advisory effort) rather than USARV (the Army combat effort) would not have a negative effect on their careers.

2007-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Amy Ryan has earned Tony nominations for her performances on Broadway as Sonya in ''Uncle Vanya'' and Stella in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' But filmgoers may know her best for making a small role sparkle two years ago in ''Capote,'' about the 1959 massacre of a Kansas family and the New Yorker writer who turned the crime into a memorable book. Playing the lead investigator's culture-starved wife, thrilled to have Truman Capote in her living room, Ms. Ryan made the ebullient, martini-shaking hostess both a comic figure and a delightful one. In Ben Affleck's feature filmmaking debut, ''Gone Baby Gone'' (Oct. 19), Ms. Ryan's role is bigger and a lot darker, and her all-American blond good looks have roughened into something sullen and hostile, her smile an angry smirk. Based on a Dennis Lehane mystery about the disappearance of a 4-year-old girl in a working-class Roman Catholic neighborhood of Boston, the movie keeps circling back to Ms. Ryan's Helene McCready, the child's mother. Apparently grief-stricken, her face goes hard once the television lights are turned off, and she jeers at the pious aunt (Amy Madigan) who calls her an abomination. Helene prefers the company at a local dive, where she was busy getting hammered when her daughter, alone in what might be the grimmest child's bedroom ever, disappeared. Still, as the hunt goes on, her hardness cracks to reveal moments of tough humor and what looks like real pain."

2007-09-09T00:00:00Z,"My comments to the Fourth Infantry Division captains with respect to Lt. Col. Paul Yingling's article were not, as Fred Kaplan writes, ''for the purpose of putting this brazen lieutenant colonel in his place'' or ''by implication . . . warning captains they had no business judging generals.'' That is not my leadership style. I lead, train, coach and mentor soldiers and do not stifle initiative or critical thought. This meeting was not about me. Instead, it was about the captains' acknowledging both Paul Yingling's and my view of general officer leadership. Never did I denigrate Paul's opinion nor did I suggest he was wrong in speaking out. Instead, I encouraged open communication at no risk of retribution. Importantly, I understand that what our young officers believe, think and say counts more than ever. As a captain, I was too often ''seen but not heard.'' Now, in this dangerous time, it is critical for senior leaders to listen and heed our battle-hardened junior leaders who volunteer to serve an Army and nation at war. My meeting with the captains focused on offering my perspective yet reminding them that there exist differing views, and that professional dialogue among the officer corps is crucial to the Army's remaining strong. Lastly, I conduct monthly meetings with all Fourth Infantry Company commanders; these meetings are designed to address their concerns. I train daily with our soldiers and consistently ask the question, What is going on and what should we do about it?"

2007-09-09T00:00:00Z,"Ben Foster has a gift for being horrific and poignant at the same time. This first emerged in the HBO series ''Six Feet Under,'' when he played the wildly neurotic, bisexual artist boyfriend of Lauren Ambrose's Claire. In last year's ''Alpha Dog,'' Mr. Foster burned up the screen as a suburban parent's worst nightmare, a speed-crazed drug dealer who, his wounded glare implied, had been an outcast in his family long before he was old enough to make trouble. In ''3:10 to Yuma'' (Oct. 7), James Mangold's expanded remake of the 1957 Glenn Ford western, he plays another young villain so well that he becomes the movie's third star. ''Yuma'' tells the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a penniless rancher who takes the dangerous job of delivering Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), the notorious leader of an outlaw gang, to the train that will transport him to prison. Mr. Foster plays Wade's second in command, Charlie Prince, who unlike the gang's other members is whippet thin and, without being silly about it, stylish. It's his anonymous gunfighter image on the advertising poster, in flat-brimmed hat, lean jeans and jacket."

''It's all Beatles music, but it's not a Beatles movie, and I didn't want it to be literal,'' she said recently, adding that a second audition erased her doubts. It's easy to see why. With his artful shag, Liverpudlian accent and high, sweet, grainy singing voice, Mr. Sturgess (who grew up middle-class in the south of England) is unmistakably Beatlesesque, especially in his early scenes. But like other characters in the movie who bring to mind vivid figures from the period, he evokes rather than impersonates. And he never breaks character in his songs, performing them with such deceptively casual ease that they seem like a natural extension of his speech."

Ed Blitzer is fondly remembered by all of us at Lightolier for his enormous contributions for over 43 years and his thoughtful leadership. Ed began his career as a salesman in 1938 with Lightolier, a company founded by his grandfather, Bernhard Blitzer, in 1904. Ed was elected President of Lightolier in 1956, succeeding his father, Moses M. D. Blitzer, and became Chairman of the Board in 1966. Noted for his uncanny ability to select and nurture management talent, Ed led Lightolier during a period of fivefold growth and expansion throughout North America. During this period, Lightolier substantially broadened its product offerings and acquired facilities across the United States and Canada, including the company's current headquarters in Fall River, Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the company's Initial Public Offering in 1968, maintaining the practices that built the company, while significantly expanding its reach. When Lightolier was faced with a hostile takeover in 1981, Ed's calm and deliberate leadership helped to orchestrate an acquisition by the Bairnco Corporation that preserved the company's identity, continued its autonomy, and retained the fundamental beliefs centered on strong relationships with customers and employees. Edward Blitzer retired as Chairman of the Board of Lightolier in 1981. BLITZER--Edward H. R., 91, died September 4th at home in NYC.

A prelude to the higher-profile Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, the ceremonies, mostly honoring achievements in categories like makeup, costumes, sound editing and art direction, singled out ''American Idol,'' the most watched television series, for a $76 million special in which producers created the illusion of Elvis Presley performing a duet with Celine Dion. During its six-year run ''American Idol'' has competed unsuccessfully for 22 Emmys, leaving it four losses from surpassing the sitcom ''Newhart,'' which collected 25 nominations without winning. ''Idol'' has been nominated for two Primetime Emmys this year. At Saturday's ceremonies the winners also included ''South Park,'' for best animated series; and ''Saturday Night Live,'' for the music and lyrics to the Justin Timberlake-Andy Samberg video ''A Special Christmas Box.''"
2007-09-10T00:00:00Z,"Alas, Poor Shakespeare Yet another effort is under way to strip Shakespeare of authorship rights to the greatest plays in English literature. Some of Britain's most distinguished theatrical figures, including the actor Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance, the former artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London, have lent their names to a ''Declaration of Reasonable Doubt'' about who wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare, a commoner reared in an illiterate household, The Associated Press reported. The declaration was made public on Saturday after the final matinee of ''I Am Shakespeare,'' a play investigating his identity, in Chichester, England. ''I subscribe to the group theory,'' Mr. Jacobi said. ''I don't think anybody could do it on their own.'' The declaration says that no records exist showing that Shakespeare received payment or secured patronage for writing, and that all the documents pertaining to him are nonliterary. He and Mr. Rylance presented a copy of the declaration, put forward by the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition and signed online by nearly 300 people, to William Leahy, the head of English at Brunel University in West London, who will convene the first graduate program in Shakespeare Authorship Studies, beginning this month. ''It's a legitimate question,'' he said. ''It has a mystery at its center. An intellectual discussion will bring us closer to that center. That's not to say we will answer anything; that's not the point. It is, of course, to question.''"
2007-09-10T00:00:00Z,"LEVITON--Harold, an Electrical industry icon, whose products are in nearly all of American homes, died peacefully September 8th, at age ninety. Despite the prominence of his company, Harold maintained a low profile, cherishing his family and long-term relationships with employees, customers and vendors. As CEO and Chairman of the Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. of Little Neck, New York, he transformed the company founded by his father in 1906 as a manufacturer of tip mantles for gas lights into a global electrical and electronic industry leader. The company is a rarity in today's environment -a large successful family - owned business. Born in Brooklyn, Harold Leviton was the son of immigrants. From the time he could walk, Harold spent weekends accompanying his father at the company's original factory in Greenpoint. There he built a strong foundation for a career spanning more than seven decades. After graduating from the University of Miami, Harold began his career in the company's purchasing department. Next he was charged with running the personnel department. This position imbued a deep respect for the value of all employees. Upon the death of his father in 1965, Harold became President and CEO of the company. He became Chairman in 1998 after the death of his brotherin-law, Jack Amsterdam. For Harold, his company's mission went beyond selling products. Quality and safety were paramount. He was an advocate in support of electrical industry standards and played a leadership role within the industry serving on the board of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) since 1976. He was Chairman of National Electrical Manufacturers Association Wiring Device Section and an honorary member of its Board of Governors as well as Chairman of the Electrical Manufacturing Council. He was a charter board member of the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFi) and served as a Vice Chairman Emeritus of the National Electrical Safety Foundation (NESF).The human side of the business always came first. Many employee and industry associates could count on a personally signed birthday note or the even more thoughtful gift of a handmade latch hook pillow or cork tray, two of his signature hobbies. There was always more than business to be done. Active with the United Jewish Y's of Long Island, he was a benefactor and onetime president and chairman of its Board. He was a founder of Israel's Technion, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (now Montefiore Medical Center) and the Leviton Industrial Arts Award, a prestigious accolade for New York City High School students in the electrical trades. He served as a Trustee and Deputy Mayor of the Village of Hewlett Harbor where he lived since 1947, Vice President of the Board of the Woodmere Academy, and Chairman of the Appeals Board and Vice Chairman of the Recreational Committee of the Five Towns. Leviton was the recipient of numerous distinguished service awards. These included the Anti-Defamation Torch of Liberty Award, the Wire and Cable Club of America's Charles D. Scott Distinguished Career Award, the Medal of Merit of the Portuguese Communities, which he received from the Government of Portugal, and the NEMA Falk Award for his many years of service to the electroindustry. Harold Leviton will be remembered as an icon in the electrical industry, and entrepreneur and visionary, generous benefactor, but most of all, as a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife Shirley, daughters, Patricia, Adrienne, and Elizabeth, sons-in-law Stephen, Donald and Andrew, 11 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. Family requests no flowers. Donations may be made to UJA Federation or the North Shore University Hospital. Services Monday 1:30pm, Temple Israel of Lawrence, 140 Central Avenue, Lawrence, NY. Donald Hendler, President Stephen Sokolow, Vice-Chairman and the Executive Committee of Leviton Manufacturing Co.,Inc. LEVITON--Harold.

2007-09-11T00:00:00Z,"LEVITON--Harold . The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn with profound sadness the passing of Harold Leviton, a cherished leader of the Long Island Jewish community and an esteemed philanthropist. Harold and his beloved wife, Shirley, shared a historic commitment to the Jewish community that was symbolized by their generous support of UJA-Federation and our network of agencies, as well as their commitment to the United Jewish Y's of Long Island. His dedication and concern for child welfare and other humanitarian causes was an expression of his passion and boundless generosity. Harold's devotion was fueled by an overwhelming dedication to tikkun olam, enriching the lives of millions in New York, in Israel, and around the world. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Shirley; to his children, Patricia and Stephen Sokolow, Adrienne and Donald Hendler, and Elizabeth and James Pearse; and to the entire family. John M. Shapiro, President Jerry W. Levin, Chair of the Board John S. Ruskay, Exec. V.P. & C.E.O. LEVITON--Harold, an Electrical industry icon, whose products are in nearly all of American homes, died peacefully September 8th, at age ninety. Despite the prominence of his company, Harold maintained a low profile, cherishing his family and long-term relationships with employees, customers and vendors. As CEO and Chairman of the Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. of Little Neck, New York, he transformed the company founded by his father in 1906 as a manufacturer of tip mantles for gas lights into a global electrical and electronic industry leader. The company is a rarity in today's environment -a large successful family - owned business. Born in Brooklyn, Harold Leviton was the son of immigrants. From the time he could walk, Harold spent weekends accompanying his father at the company's original factory in Greenpoint. There he built a strong foundation for a career spanning more than seven decades. After graduating from the University of Miami, Harold began his career in the company's purchasing department. Next he was charged with running the personnel department. This position imbued a deep respect for the value of all employees. Upon the death of his father in 1965, Harold became President and CEO of the company. He became Chairman in 1998 after the death of his brotherin-law, Jack Amsterdam. For Harold, his company's mission went beyond selling products. Quality and safety were paramount. He was an advocate in support of electrical industry standards and played a leadership role within the industry serving on the board of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) since 1976. He was Chairman of National Electrical Manufacturers Association Wiring Device Section and an honorary member of its Board of Governors as well as Chairman of the Electrical Manufacturing Council. He was a charter board member of the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFi) and served as a Vice Chairman Emeritus of the National Electrical Safety Foundation (NESF).The human side of the business always came first. Many employee and industry associates could count on a personally signed birthday note or the even more thoughtful gift of a handmade latch hook pillow or cork tray, two of his signature hobbies. There was always more than business to be done. Active with the United Jewish Y's of Long Island, he was a benefactor and onetime president and chairman of its Board. He was a founder of Israel's Technion, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (now Montefiore Medical Center) and the Leviton Industrial Arts Award, a prestigious accolade for New York City High School students in the electrical trades. He served as a Trustee and Deputy Mayor of the Village of Hewlett Harbor where he lived since 1947, Vice President of the Board of the Woodmere Academy, and Chairman of the Appeals Board and Vice Chairman of the Recreational Committee of the Five Towns. Leviton was the recipient of numerous distinguished service awards. These included the Anti-Defamation Torch of Liberty Award, the Wire and Cable Club of America's Charles D. Scott Distinguished Career Award, the Medal of Merit of the Portuguese Communities, which he received from the Government of Portugal, and the NEMA Falk Award for his many years of service to the electroindustry. Harold Leviton will be remembered as an icon in the electrical industry, and entrepreneur and visionary, generous benefactor, but most of all, as a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife Shirley, daughters, Patricia, Adrienne, and Elizabeth, sons-in-law Stephen, Donald and Andrew, 11 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. Family requests no flowers. Donations may be made to UJA Federation or the North Shore University Hospital. Services Monday 1:30pm, Temple Israel of Lawrence, 140 Central Avenue, Lawrence, NY. Donald Hendler, President Stephen Sokolow, Vice-Chairman and the Executive Committee of Leviton Manufacturing Co.,Inc. LEVITON--Harold. The Woodmere Club deeply regrets the passing of our good friend and longtime member, Harold Leviton. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to his family and friends. The Board of Governors The Woodmere Club LEVITON--Harold. We mourn the loss of our beloved father, grandfather and great-grandfather/Opa. He will be greatly missed by all of us.

2007-09-11T00:00:00Z,"To mark the sixth anniversary of Sept. 11, the Op-Ed page asked five artists to visit ground zero, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa., the scenes of the day's devastation. Here are their pictures and words. At first glance, ground zero is another busy, loud construction site. Yet the area is oddly open for the city. And once you look past the obstructions that hide the actual site from curious onlookers, you realize something is missing. The painful truth that steel has been ripped out of the concrete and thousands have died is revealed in a glimpse of the gaping hole left by the missing towers. It can be measured only by looking at the trucks and people nearby, shrunken in contrast to ant size. -- Paul Hoppe"

2007-09-12T06:19:08Z,"Compiled by John Woods, Benjamin Hoffman, Naila-Jean Meyers and Andrew DasThe Legend of Reno MaheThe name on the tongue of Eagles fans early this week was not Donovan McNabb or Brian Westbrook or even Andy Reid. It was Reno Mahe, who was the Eagles' semi-regular punt returner the past three seasons. Mahe was not re-signed this year as the Eagles sought to energize their punt-return game, which ranked 10th last season. They turned the job over to J.R. Reed and Greg Lewis, two experienced kickoff returners who nonetheless had never returned a punt in a regular-season game.In Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Packers, it showed. Lewis flubbed a punt, which the Packers recovered in the end zone. Reed flubbed another, which the Packers recovered, unbelievably, at the Eagles' 35 with 1 minute 9 seconds left in the game and the score tied. They ran three plays and kicked the winning field goal.Which brings us to Mahe, whom the Eagles flew in from his home in Utah.""All they said was, 'We're flying you out here, and we'll see you soon,' "" Mahe told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday. ""I'm just excited to come back.""He signed a one-year contract Tuesday.So what is it about Mahe? In four seasons, he had unremarkable return numbers but only three fumbles, only one of which happened when he was supposed to be catching a punt."

While his entire family and countless individuals who were touched by his warmhearted generosity mourn Sunday's passing of Joseph Monti, we take solace in knowing that he and his beloved wife Tita leave behind a legacy that will last for generations. Joseph Monti was born in Manhattan, New York, the youngest son of immigrant parents, Domenico and Caroline Pisani Monti. A graduate of the Julliard School of Music, Mr. Monti pursued a career in opera. As a promising young tenor, he appeared on Broadway with many noted entertainers and recorded for Columbia records. In 1943, he met the beautiful Titania Scandalis, a concert pianist and gifted soprano. They were married in 1944. After a successful career in the entertainment industry, Mr. Monti formed the JCJ Restaurant Corporation, followed by the Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury, New York. This was the beginning of a passionate 54-year career in the restaurant, hospitality and real estate industry. In 1972, the Monti's founded the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation in memory of their 16-year old son Don, who died of Leukemia in June of that year. Completely underwritten by the Monti's, the Foundation established the Don Monti Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology at North Shore University Hospital, the largest cancer care, research and education network on Long Island. In 2006, the Foundation formed an alliance with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and established the Tita Monti Cancer Research Laboratory. Mr. Monti served as a trustee of the North Shore--Long Island Jewish Health System for more than 30 years and was a member of the Tilles Center Council of Overseers. He was also a Director of the Boy Scouts of America, The Dante Foundation and The Columbus Citizens Foundation. In addition, he was a Knight of the American Sovereign Military Order of the Knights of Malta and a sponsor of the International Committee of Boys Town of Italy.

2007-09-13T00:00:00Z,"SUDNOW--David Nathan. With the passing of David Sudnow on July 20, 2007 at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California, came the loss of one of the last, great, original ethnomethodologists; that small group of revolutionary sociologists who believed that sociological studies of group processes were not simply exercises in theoretical analyses or rationalizations after the fact about people in groups, but rather were about social phenomena as concrete observable facts (though often unacknowledged in situations). In part derivative of the original observational methods of Emile Durkheim's classical ''Suicide'' and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, these ethnomethodologists would go into a psychiatric clinic and ask for the embarrassingly difficult factual, observational differences between patients and care givers. One of them walked into my biochemistry suite at the medical school and said, ''Oh, this is what those about you would call a laboratory.'' They flushed the unwritten rule dividing the patient's and doctor's coffee machines in a psychiatric ward by violating it. They demonstrated the strange set of unwritten rules among chess players by upsetting an opponent irrationally by simply exchanging pawns without any alteration in position. In 1964, four years before Harold Garfinkel's, another of the pioneers, book was published, ''Studies in Ethnomethodology'', Sudnow published the field defining book, ''Passing On: The Social Organization of Dying,'' now in its twenty-eighth edition, from the data collected during two years of on-site observations. It was a painful explication of the ''facts'' about how social class affected the choice and execution of real procedures relevant to health care and dying in a charity hospital. He was early into studies of conversation about what was really going on between people conversing. Along with Harvey Sachs, another of this elite group of social analysts, Sudnow's classical work was about ''glancing.'' In 1972, he edited and published ''Studies in Social Interaction.'' He applied his phenomenological point of view to the interaction of gamer and game, the video game-user interphase, and published ''Pilgrim in the Microworld'' in 1984. He was best known for his 1978 book, ''Ways of the Hand, The Organization of Improvised Conduct'', for which he was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship. It detailed his personal account of learning improvisational jazz on the piano. It was written from the same what-is-really-going-on point of view. His method was radical and completely atheoretical, no scales and chords, no required Bach-like exercises, no figures in all keys, and no harmonic structure. He followed this with a similarly oriented study of musical conversation, ''Talk's Body, a Meditation Between Two Key Boards'' in 1989. The Sudnow Piano Method became a kind of artistic self realization movement mediated by imaginative web site interactions and material. It was so popular, at one time or other it involved interactions with 25,000 piano students. His piano pedagogy pulled him from a distinguished academic career in which for 15 years, he held professorial status at the University of California at Santa Barbara, University of California at Irvine, University of California at Berkeley, and various visiting professorships in Europe. He will certainly be missed by thousands of his piano students. Less well known is that we also have lost one of the four or five revolutionary sociologists of the 1960's and 1970's whose ethnomethodologically oriented work augured the present, highly controversial ''deconstructionist'' era across the sciences. David Sudnow was 68. He is survived by his wife, Wendy Lu, a sister, Naomi Rubine, children Paul and Jessica, and two grandchildren. Arnold J.

2007-09-13T00:00:00Z,"''Dr. Johnson's Doorknob and Other Significant Parts of Great Men's Houses,'' by Liz Workman (Rizzoli; $25), is a curious little artifact of a book, with photographs of the skirting boards, ashtrays, doorknobs and other domestic objects found in the homes of George Washington, Washington Irving, Sigmund Freud, F.D.R. (see his chair, far left) and Winston Churchill (and his, left). The randomness of the objects (desks are included, but so are banisters and soup tureens) points out the weirdness inherent in mythmaking and the creating of shrines. ''Through most of the houses in this book stalk invisible wives, who can claim nothing,'' Germaine Greer writes in her introduction, clearly irritated by the book's organizing principles. ''Winston Churchill is thought to have pervaded Chartwell, so that every bibelot is where it is by his express command. In fact it was Clementine who ran Chartwell as a living breathing house full of visitors and children and animals, and I wouldn't mind betting that Winston could never find anything without asking her first where it was.''"

A three-judge appeals panel ruled yesterday that Lawrence Township could ban the big black rat, which a union local wanted to display during a protest in 2005. But the litigants can appeal automatically to the Supreme Court because of one judge’s partial dissent. The event, at Gold’s Gym in Lawrence, was staged by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to protest low wages paid to electricians by an out-of-area contractor. Wayne DeAngelo, the senior union official on the site, was fined for violating an ordinance preventing the display of banners, streamers and inflatable signs. The appeals panel affirmed Mr. DeAngelo’s conviction yesterday. However, Judge Jack Sabatino of the Appellate Division of State Superior Court wrote that the ban might be unfair because it exempted signs for grand openings."

DiNapoli, criticizes the financial management of a program in which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority periodically runs excursions with vintage subway cars, called the Nostalgia Train. The trips raise money for the New York Transit Museum, an arm of the authority based in a decommissioned subway station in Brooklyn Heights. Mr. DiNapoli’s audit, released on Wednesday, found that the authority did not adequately keep track of the money it raised. It also said repairs to the trains were paid for by New York City Transit, meaning that subway riders and taxpayers were subsidizing the rides. The comptroller’s office recommended that the authority’s board “evaluate the appropriateness of this fund-raising arrangement.” The authority noted that the Transit Museum was not expected to turn a profit."

He was a man who loved life and loved his family. He was a visionary who gave tirelessly to the community and served on the boards of the White Plains Hospital, Blythedale Children's Hospital, SUNY Purchase and Mt. Holyoke Art Museum. He also served on the boards of the Scarsdale Board of Education, Hospital for Joint Diseases, UJA, Human Rights Watch, The Fund for Free Expression, Jewish Community Center of White Plains, Barnard College, and the STEP program. The Scarsdale Foundation honored him with the Scarsdale Bowl in 1986. A graduate of Cornell University, Joseph served in the army in the Second World War. Upon his discharge he worked for and subsequently became the president and owner of Richard Bauer and Co. until he was 79.

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"EARTHA KITTIt is not entirely far-fetched to imagine Eartha Kitt as the opening act of MTV's Video Music Awards. Imagine her Catwoman from the television series ''Batman'' growling ''I Want to Be Evil,'' one of her signature songs from the early 1950s, at last Sunday's awards, instead of a glassy-eyed Britney Spears sloppily lip-synching her latest single, ''Gimme More,'' while executing a few feeble bumps and grinds. Ms. Kitt doesn't need to lip-sync, nor is there anything feeble about her. A complete show business professional, this eternal sex kitten, who turned 80 last January, is in trimmer condition right now than Ms. Spears apparently is. And believe it or not, she is still smolderingly sexy. Ms. Kitt knows how to make a single shoulder shrug or raised eyebrow convey more erotic provocation than most performers less than half her age. And when she locks eyes with a man at ringside and begins to purr and play the gold digger, she emits a dangerous electric charge. It's all in fun, of course. Or is it?"

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"'PASO DOBLE' Collaborative ventures between artists in different places usually mean that each works separately, and that the pieces are put together late in the creative process. ''Paso Doble,'' a performance event by the Hungarian-born choreographer Josef Nadj and the Catalan artist Miquel Barceló, which opens the St. Ann's Warehouse season tonight, is a rare example of another kind of collaboration. On a stage covered in red clay, Mr. Nadj (at painting, above) and Mr. Barceló (in foreground) punch their way through an initially pristine white wall, then -- using pickaxes and shovels, sculpturing tools and their bare hands -- they carve, dig and shape the clay into a landscape of forms that are quickly erased and replaced. Mr. Barceló bangs the floor until a pool of water appears. Mr. Nadj, a tall man with the face of a tragic clown, sets a soft clay pot on top of his head and lets it slowly melt over his face. At the end they are covered in rusty clay and white dust, almost indistinguishable from their material. As they work, they are performers, choreographers, sculptors and artists all at once. And they are also part of the artwork itself, their bodies mutable elements in its changing topography."

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC The horns are not just plentiful but purposeful during the Festival of New Trumpet Music, which begins its fifth year of programming tomorrow night. Founded and directed by Dave Douglas, a jazz trumpeter rightly celebrated for his imaginative rigor, it presents a host of independent-minded artists in a range of club and concert settings. A kickoff concert at the Center for Improvisational Music in Brooklyn will benefit a handful of musician-run educational programs in the city. And its roster of performers neatly encapsulates the festival's broad-minded ethos: Cecil Bridgewater, Ralph Alessi, Taylor Ho Bynum and Roy Campbell Jr. all bring different perspectives as trumpeters and improvisers, as does Mr. Douglas, above, who will also perform. Of course those artists have something in common besides their choice of instrument. By definition, the Festival of New Trumpet Music prizes a spirit of innovation; that ''new'' in the title is no accident. It's a mandate that should resonate with anyone who has observed the prolific Mr. Douglas over the last dozen years. Within the next week alone, he will introduce two new compositions as part of the festival: ''Blue Latitudes,'' at the Manhattan School of Music on Sunday, and ''Inspiration,'' a collaborative effort with his fellow trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, at Jazz Standard on Thursday. And judging by precedent, Mr. Douglas will be present for most of the other events."

He leaves behind his wife and best friend Greta Walker, children Andrew, Betsy, and Judith, stepson David, their partners Kevin, Dana, and Charlotte, four grandchildren, and a bounty of friends. He was lucky to have married happily twice, and was predeceased by Barbara Yager Witten on September 15th, 1987. Bob was a consummate New Yorker; he moved from NJ in 1937 to attend Columbia College and stayed here taking advantage of everything the City could offer: opera, theater, and summers on Fire Island playing tennis and chasing away the deer. He was also a great traveler, something that grew from his years as an officer in the Navy aboard the USS Greene during WWII. Bob had a sharp mind, great humor, and integrity. He built his company on hard work and his handshake. He was proud that people trusted and relied on him, and so were we. A private ceremony will be held.

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"The British release and London Film Festival screening of Ben Affleck's first full-length feature as a director, ''Gone Baby Gone,'' have been scrubbed because of its parallels to the case of Madeleine McCann, the British 4-year-old who vanished in Portugal in May, the BBC reported. The film, starring Mr. Affleck's brother Casey Affleck and Morgan Freeman, follows two Boston private detectives helping a police investigation of a missing child, played by Madeline O'Brien, who bears a close resemblance to the missing girl. In a statement explaining their decision to postpone the British release, scheduled for Dec. 28, Buena Vista International, the distributor, and Miramax, its subsidiary, said they were ''sensitive to the depth of feeling surrounding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.'' Sandra Hebron, artistic director of the London Film Festival, where the movie was to have been shown on Oct. 26, said she supported the decision to withdraw the film, filmed last year and based on a 1998 Dennis Lehane novel of the same title. Speaking at the recent Deauville Film Festival, Ben Affleck said he was ''acutely aware of the situation'' regarding Madeleine McCann and called the release of the film ''just a commercial matter, whereas this is a matter of life and death.'' He added, ''We don't want to release the movie if it is going to touch a nerve or inflame anybody's sensitivities.'' A district attorney in Portugal is deciding whether to charge Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine's parents, in the case. They were cited as suspects last week."

The officers and Associates of Cotterell, Mitchell and Fifer (CM&F Group) mourn the September 7th passing of our former Vice President, mentor and friend. He was a gentleman of the Old School who, from the time he came to Cotterell from Colgate after World War II until his retirement some 40 years later, always and in every way comported himself with aplomb, dignity and forbearance. He was a master of the arcane aspects of Commercial Insurance and Surety and lent his expertise to numerous clients as well as mentoring new professionals when they entered the field.

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"MAD. SQ. ART 2007: 'AROUND THE PARK' There is a meticulous absurdity to William Wegman's ''Around the Park,'' a temporary video installation adjacent to Shake Shack, the popular food kiosk in Madison Square Park. Showing simultaneously on four outdoor television monitors, the video, above, follows two lovely silver-gray Weimaraners, Penny and Bobbin, as they enjoy a day in the park. But this isn't a dog walk -- far from it. Mr. Wegman has dressed the dogs to look like people and then filmed them lounging about on benches, reading books, interacting with each other on the lawn, eating burgers and fries at the kiosk, and even driving around collecting trash. It is a cross between the 1974 television series ''Planet of the Apes'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' It is also a carefully contrived stunt, with the dogs propped up on stools as hidden actors hold them in place. These actors also provide the dogs with surrogate hands with which to hold food, books and other items. Still, it took Mr. Wegman many days of shooting to get the approximately seven-minute-long footage showing here; the dogs were incredibly skittish and kept darting off whenever they saw a squirrel.

2007-09-14T00:00:00Z,"I used to spend about 50 percent of my life on the road, so maybe it's not so surprising that I live for part of each week in a condo that is part of a hotel. About four years ago I bought this apartment at the Four Seasons, which is in a great location right in downtown San Francisco. Owning a condo that is part of a hotel certainly gives an added level of security. And it's not a 14-deadbolts-on-the-door type of security, but rather a level of comfort and attention that makes it possible for friends to use the apartment when I'm not there. My visitors can come and go as needed. The lobby is graceful and doesn't necessarily feel like a hotel, and we have access to all those hotel amenities. The health club is large, and most of the time I just head down there in my robe. I regularly order room service and in fact the entire menu of the Four Seasons restaurant is available. But perhaps the best thing about the condo is that I've been able to keep my San Francisco roots. As my wine business, Lynmar Winery, has grown, I've spent more of each week up at my house in Sonoma County. I was born and raised in this city, so it has been nice keep a place here. I not only run a nonprofit, but there are events that keep me in town. I still travel a fair amount, but now when I do I simply call the concierge. They'll even handle booking my hotel reservations."

Together, Harriet and Robert embraced the research of investigators working at the frontiers of biomedicine, establishing two professorships at Rockefeller. The Heilbrunns immeasurably strengthened research in cancer and diabetes, and their magnificent support for The Rockefeller University Hospital was recognized in 2003 with the naming of the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Outpatient Research Center. In her own right, Harriet was a leading champion of stem cell research, founding the Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Stem Cell Research Center. Harriet's seriousness of purpose was matched by her bright smile and an ever-present twinkle in her eye, both of which enlivened many a Rockefeller gathering.

The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the loss of our beloved friend and extraordinarily generous benefactor, Harriet Heilbrunn. Harriet lived a remarkable life of meaning and valor. Her indomitable spirit, incomparable grace, and inexhaustible humanity and compassion endeared her to all. Devoted to Jewish values and ideals, Harriet, along with her cherished late husband, Robert, was determined to help craft a world in which we could all live together in mutual respect and dignity. Throughout her nearly seven decades with Bob, and later on her own, Harriet remained devoted to a host of philanthropic causes that touched her heart and offered a vision for a brighter future for all. Both Bob and Harriet were members of AJC's Board of Governors and National Leadership Council. In 1997, they established AJC's Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Institute for International Interreligious Understanding, greatly expanding AJC's already highly acclaimed interreligious work. In 1998, they endowed AJC's Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Humanitarian Relief Fund, allowing AJC to respond quickly and effectively to crises at home and around the world. With Harriet's passing, the world has lost a beautiful and noble soul and AJC has lost an irreplaceable member of our family. Yet our sadness, however deep, remains tempered with abiding gratitude and love for her extraordinary legacy of caring and human kindness. At this most difficult and painful time, we extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to Harriet's children, Helaine and Sidney Lerner and Joan and Robert Rechnitz, her grandchildren, great-grandchildren and the rest of the grieving family.

Players can decorate apartments, arranging furniture, hanging artwork and choosing wallpaper — and if the crib feels too small, they can upgrade to a penthouse.

They’ve also come to expect a number or two from the James Gang. Said gang — Jellyroll James, Deacon Boondini and the Great Gatsby — has called its song-and-dance shtick “wop pop,” a mash-up of doo-wop and hip-hop that folds in Harlem Renaissance swing and rap. Because nothing goes better with bottle service than a barbershop tune about bow ties performed with Charleston-era choreography — twirling walking sticks and all. As with Outkast, authentic old-school style is key. “There’s a part of dressing for performance that’s been lost with contemporary artists,” says Deacon, who lists Cab Calloway and the Nicholas Brothers as inspirations. “We want to go back to that and make it special again.” Their garb is culled from vintage dealers and eBay, as well as from a tailor on 125th Street who “knickers up” their suit pants. But not everything of yore is at their feet. Says Jellyroll with a sigh, “The knee-high argyle socks are the hardest to find. We have to order them from Scotland because nobody here makes them anymore.”."

Hand-stitched from rugged materials like moose and bison skins in a variety of classic Down East styles, the shoes come with a scout’s honor from Quoddy to resole boots and bluchers (for a nominal fee) no matter how many summers in Dark Harbor — or barbecues in Williamsburg — they’ve endured.

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"SUDNOW--David Nathan. With the passing of David Sudnow on July 20, 2007 at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California, came the loss of one of the last, great, original ethnomethodologists; that small group of revolutionary sociologists who believed that sociological studies of group processes were not simply exercises in theoretical analyses or rationalizations after the fact about people in groups, but rather were about social phenomena as concrete observable facts (though often unacknowledged in situations). In part derivative of the original observational methods of Emile Durkheim's classical ''Suicide'' and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, these ethnomethodologists would go into a psychiatric clinic and ask for the embarrassingly difficult factual, observational differences between patients and care givers. One of them walked into my biochemistry suite at the medical school and said, ''Oh, this is what those about you would call a laboratory.'' They flushed the unwritten rule dividing the patient's and doctor's coffee machines in a psychiatric ward by violating it. They demonstrated the strange set of unwritten rules among chess players by upsetting an opponent irrationally by simply exchanging pawns without any alteration in position. In 1964, four years before Harold Garfinkel's, another of the pioneers, book was published, ''Studies in Ethnomethodology'', Sudnow published the field defining book, ''Passing On: The Social Organization of Dying,'' now in its twenty-eighth edition, from the data collected during two years of on-site observations. It was a painful explication of the ''facts'' about how social class affected the choice and execution of real procedures relevant to health care and dying in a charity hospital. He was early into studies of conversation about what was really going on between people conversing. Along with Harvey Sachs, another of this elite group of social analysts, Sudnow's classical work was about ''glancing.'' In 1972, he edited and published ''Studies in Social Interaction.'' He applied his phenomenological point of view to the interaction of gamer and game, the video game-user interphase, and published ''Pilgrim in the Microworld'' in 1984. He was best known for his 1978 book, ''Ways of the Hand, The Organization of Improvised Conduct'', for which he was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship. It detailed his personal account of learning improvisational jazz on the piano. It was written from the same what-is-really-going-on point of view. His method was radical and completely atheoretical, no scales and chords, no required Bach-like exercises, no figures in all keys, and no harmonic structure. He followed this with a similarly oriented study of musical conversation, ''Talk's Body, a Meditation Between Two Key Boards'' in 1989. The Sudnow Piano Method became a kind of artistic self realization movement mediated by imaginative web site interactions and material. It was so popular, at one time or other it involved interactions with 25,000 piano students. His piano pedagogy pulled him from a distinguished academic career in which for 15 years, he held professorial status at the University of California at Santa Barbara, University of California at Irvine, University of California at Berkeley, and various visiting professorships in Europe. He will certainly be missed by thousands of his piano students. Less well known is that we also have lost one of the four or five revolutionary sociologists of the 1960's and 1970's whose ethnomethodologically oriented work augured the present, highly controversial ''deconstructionist'' era across the sciences. David Sudnow was 68. He is survived by his wife, Wendy Lu, a sister, Naomi Rubine, children Paul and Jessica, and two grandchildren. Arnold J.

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"LEVITON--Harold, an Electrical industry icon, whose products are in nearly all of American homes, died peacefully September 8th, at age ninety. Despite the prominence of his company, Harold maintained a low profile, cherishing his family and long-term relationships with employees, customers and vendors. As CEO and Chairman of the Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. of Little Neck, New York, he transformed the company founded by his father in 1906 as a manufacturer of tip mantles for gas lights into a global electrical and electronic industry leader. The company is a rarity in today's environment -a large successful family - owned business. Born in Brooklyn, Harold Leviton was the son of immigrants. From the time he could walk, Harold spent weekends accompanying his father at the company's original factory in Greenpoint. There he built a strong foundation for a career spanning more than seven decades. After graduating from the University of Miami, Harold began his career in the company's purchasing department. Next he was charged with running the personnel department. This position imbued a deep respect for the value of all employees. Upon the death of his father in 1965, Harold became President and CEO of the company. He became Chairman in 1998 after the death of his brotherin-law, Jack Amsterdam. For Harold, his company's mission went beyond selling products. Quality and safety were paramount. He was an advocate in support of electrical industry standards and played a leadership role within the industry serving on the board of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) since 1976. He was Chairman of National Electrical Manufacturers Association Wiring Device Section and an honorary member of its Board of Governors as well as Chairman of the Electrical Manufacturing Council. He was a charter board member of the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFi) and served as a Vice Chairman Emeritus of the National Electrical Safety Foundation (NESF).The human side of the business always came first. Many employee and industry associates could count on a personally signed birthday note or the even more thoughtful gift of a handmade latch hook pillow or cork tray, two of his signature hobbies. There was always more than business to be done. Active with the United Jewish Y's of Long Island, he was a benefactor and onetime president and chairman of its Board. He was a founder of Israel's Technion, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (now Montefiore Medical Center) and the Leviton Industrial Arts Award, a prestigious accolade for New York City High School students in the electrical trades. He served as a Trustee and Deputy Mayor of the Village of Hewlett Harbor where he lived since 1947, Vice President of the Board of the Woodmere Academy, and Chairman of the Appeals Board and Vice Chairman of the Recreational Committee of the Five Towns. Leviton was the recipient of numerous distinguished service awards. These included the Anti-Defamation Torch of Liberty Award, the Wire and Cable Club of America's Charles D. Scott Distinguished Career Award, the Medal of Merit of the Portuguese Communities, which he received from the Government of Portugal, and the NEMA Falk Award for his many years of service to the electroindustry. Harold Leviton will be remembered as an icon in the electrical industry, and entrepreneur and visionary, generous benefactor, but most of all, as a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife Shirley, daughters, Patricia, Adrienne, and Elizabeth, sons-in-law Stephen, Donald and Andrew, 11 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. Family requests no flowers. Donations may be made to UJA Federation or the North Shore University Hospital. Services Monday 1:30pm, Temple Israel of Lawrence, 140 Central Avenue, Lawrence, NY.

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"Nintendo's addictive tennis video game may have had hipsters swatting at the air in Williamsburg crash pads, but for professional tennis fans and video-game connoisseurs, it was hardly an ace. Top Spin 3 from 2K Games, which is scheduled for release next spring, takes aim at those wonks with a product touted as the most realistic tennis video game ever. Compatible with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Top Spin 3 breaks ground by adding bygone tennis legends as characters (Roger Federer, Andy Roddick and James Blake appeared in the game's previous edition) and by letting players clone themselves into avatars, specifying height, clothing, nationality and characteristics like moles. But the realism may go too far: a ''dynamic stains and sweat'' feature adds verisimilar perspiration on clothing, skin and hair, which means long matches yield vicious pit stains. Look forward to tennis elbow, athlete's foot and adjustable Agassi mullets in Top Spin 4."

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"When it comes to fashion, Stefano Pilati is not afraid to lead by example. As the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent, he embodies the louche elegance of one of the world's most iconic labels. With his slicked-back hair, carefully groomed beard and lithe figure, Pilati projects an innate sense of elegance. Frayed jeans and tight-fitting clothes are not for him: Pilati identifies with the Old World glamour of tuxedos and scarves. He is seldom seen without a foulard around his neck; he jauntily folds up the sleeves of his figure-skimming suits, which he sometimes cinches with a large safety pin; and he rocks vintage cuff links and jeweled rings the way a pop star flaunts tight jeans. Hardly surprising, then, that Pilati chose Melvil Poupaud -- practically his doppelganger -- when asked whom he would most like to style. Poupaud, one of France's leading young actors, is the star of the recent indie favorites ''Broken English'' and ''Le Temps Qui Reste''; he is also in a rock band called Mud. It's a perfect match for Pilati, who tempers his love of dandyism with a healthy dose of pop culture: he is sometimes spotted dancing until dawn, has several tattoos under those perfectly tailored shirts and will admit, if pressed, that he has been less than saintly in the past. Like Saint Laurent before him, Pilati is keenly aware that in order to successfully promote a lifestyle, you need to be prepared to live it."

Eliot Spitzer's administration misused the State Police to smear a political opponent, has a big transport angle. The governor's staff members were trying to get state troopers to release the travel logs of State Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader. Those logs made it clear that Mr. Bruno was often using state helicopters and cars to travel to Republican fund-raisers. At the same time, the state's lobbying commission accused a businessman of improperly allowing Mr. Bruno to use his private plane and helicopter. The same businessman lathered Mr. Bruno with campaign contributions, and was associated with a firm that got $500,000 in state grants, courtesy of Mr. Bruno."

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"One evening in June, Sidney Toledano, the 56-year-old chief executive of Dior, was having dinner with his wife, Katia, at L'Ami Louis, the sentimental Paris bistro known for its poulet rÃ$(4$)ti. The place was crowded and hot, and the old French waiters radiated displeasure. A man at a nearby table, a friend of the couple's, sent over a bottle of ChÃteau Latour, and Toledano, who had removed his coat and tie and was beginning to relax, smiled and thanked the man, who was with a fine-boned English blonde in a white cotton dress. Toledano is tall, with a heavy jaw, a large nose, hooded eyes that glow with intimate interest, and a full head of silvery hair. Editors consider him good-looking, as if this comes as a surprise to them, and because he is candid and outgoing, without the aggressive charm of other fashion executives, they also feel they can trust what he tells them about the state of Dior, which he has run for the past 10 years. Somewhere in Toledano's coat pockets was a pack of cigarettes. He smokes less from anxiety, one feels, than from a need to shepherd a thought or a problem to a satisfactory conclusion. Though intuitive, he admits he does not readily grasp the arbitrary rules of creative genius, but is prepared, nonetheless, to wage a quiet, rational war with them until there is a peace. Once, in his student days -- Toledano grew up in Casablanca and studied engineering and mathematics at the Ãcole Centrale Paris -- he got a zero on an exam because he spent the entire time working on the first question, which, to his amazement, had stumped him. Yet such determination helps explain Toledano's reputation as a great manager. Not only does he work effectively with Bernard Arnault, who owns Dior and is the chairman of LVMH, Toledano also manages three designers, with three distinct styles and personalities -- John Galliano, Dior's flamboyant creative director; Victoire de Castellane, its designer of fine jewelry; and Kris Van Assche, the successor to Hedi Slimane, who modernized Dior Homme with sleek tailoring and who was recently cut loose. Toledano helped oversee Fendi, which belongs to LVMH, and that meant, of course, he had to deal with Karl Lagerfeld, who took issue with many things at Fendi but never with Toledano's management."

Lacoste is collaborating with the furniture designer Michael Young on a series of shirts with plastic accents that resemble crocodile skin; Adam+Eve is offering '70s-era short-shorts; and Fila released a version of the jacket that Bjorn Borg popularized at the height of his career.

GREEN BAY'S TIGHT ENDS If Jared Lorenzen makes his first start at quarterback for the Giants, in place of the sore-shouldered Eli Manning, he is the game's key. The Packers will blitz him mercilessly, knowing that Lorenzen is slow-footed and inexperienced. But the other intriguing matchup features Kiwanuka, who struggled in pass coverage -- as the Giants expected and feared -- in his first game since moving to linebacker from defensive end during the off-season. Last week, the Cowboys and quarterback Tony Romo found open spaces down the middle of the field with midrange passes. Six of those passes went to tight end Jason Witten, for 116 yards and a touchdown. Kiwanuka's play was suspect enough that, in the wake of a knee injury to defensive end Osi Umenyiora, the Giants considered moving Kiwanuka back to end this week. The Packers have a three-time Pro Bowl tight end in Bubba Franks, now a backup to Donald Lee. The two combined for 6 catches and 44 yards in a victory over the Eagles last Sunday."

2007-09-16T00:00:00Z,"GALLUP--Kingsley H. Died peacefully at her home in Princeton, NJ on Saturday, September 8, age 70, from complications related to breast cancer. She is survived by her husband, George, children Alison and George of Knoxville, TN, and Kingsley and granddaughter, Daisy, from Durango, CO. She is also survived by her mother, Kingsley K. Hubby, of Old Black Point, CT, brothers Nicholas Hubby of Ogunquit, ME, Frank B. Hubby of Savannah, GA, and sister, Alison Hoversten of Vail and Denver, CO. Kingsley, also called ''Kinny'', attended Miss Fine's School, Princeton, NJ, The Lennox School, NYC and Bennett College, Millbrook, NY. Kinny was a talented figure skater in her youth and was the Senior Lady Champion of the Princeton Skating Club. She served a term as the President of the Board of Trustees of the Mercer Council on Alcoholism. Over the last 20 years, she and her husband, George, facilitated small bible study groups at their home and spoke at numerous churches around the country on this form of ministry. She played a major role with George in developing and managing the George H. Gallup International Institute, a non-profit organization, founded in 1988. The Institute was created by the Gallup family in honor of George's father, Dr. George Gallup, founder of The Gallup Poll. The mission of the Institute is to ''discover, test, and implement new ideas for society''. A person of great charm, grace and beauty, Kinny's priorities were God, family, and friends. Faced with a deadly illness eight years ago, she made the decision to be a witness to the power of the Lord in her life. She spent her remaining years in heartfelt service to others. A memorial service will be held at the University of Princeton Chapel on Friday, September 21 at 10:00am. Donations may be given to the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania, Development Office, 3535 Market Street, Suite 730, Philadelphia, PA. 19104; to the Trinity School for Ministry, 311 Eleventh Street, Ambridge, PA. 15003; or to the Battle Against Hunger, St. Matthew's Church, 300 South Main Street, Pennington, NJ 08534."

Lindsay administration, fueled by an extraordinary surge in real estate revenues, Diane Cardwell reports in a front-page article. The Times reviewed city data going back to 1980 and found that the city budget, adjusted for inflation, has grown by 23 percent, to $60 billion, since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, compared with 8 percent during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s eight years; 4 percent under Mayor David N. Dinkins’s four years; and 19 percent during the last two terms of Mayor Edward I. Koch.About 75 percent of the growth under Mr. Bloomberg has been driven by expenses that are difficult to control, like employee health care costs and benefits, pension payments and Medicaid. Even so, Mr. Bloomberg has increased spending on controllable expenses, like parks, information technology and schools. The number of city workers has declined by about 1 percent since Mr. Bloomberg took office, but he has been increasing the staff of late. Mr. Bloomberg’s aides argued that their approach has been restrained and that the mayor’s investment in services has helped the city thrive."

2007-09-17T16:03:08Z,"Assemblyman James F. Brennan, Democrat of Brooklyn, has teamed up with an expert on energy regulation to argue that New Yorkers have paid a high price for the state’s decision to deregulate New York’s wholesale electricity market beginning in late 1999 and early 2000.Gov. George E. Pataki led the deregulation push, in which most of the state utilities, including Consolidated Edison, sold their power plants to independent companies, then brought power on unregulated wholesale markets. But instead of lower prices, New Yorkers have faced increases far larger than consumers in states that kept their power industries regulated, according to a study by Marilyn Showalter of Power in the Public Interest, which oppose energy deregulation. The new figures may provide momentum to members of the Legislature who are interested in re-regulating the power markets in New York."
