1987-03-15T00:00:00Z,"THE life depicted in the Polish film ''A Woman Alone'' is unrelievedly grim. It is the life of Irena (Maria Chwalibog), an unwed working mother whose energies are being taxed to their limit. She lives in a small room with her young son Bob (Pawel Witczak), and must share a bed with him; mother and son are also harassed by their landlord. Her job as a letter carrier is so physically draining that she sometimes collapses under the weight of her sack. Her life seems to hold no satisfactions, not even small ones. Even when she bathes at home (where there is no indoor plumbing), she must do it with Bob's used bathwater. And she has no real hope. Irena pays weekly visits to a dying aunt whom she hopes may leave her a small sum, but the trips exhaust her even further - and she winds up having to assume household expenses for the aunt, who is apparently a miser. She cannot turn to family, to friends, to her work or even to Bob for any comfort."

1987-03-15T00:00:00Z,"THE one time I tried to use a Ouija board, the marker refused to move, and I tossed it aside after a few seconds. ''Witchboard'' convinces me I was right. Any movie that features a Ouija - or ''witchboard,'' as we're told it's sometimes called - as a way for spirits to enter this world ought to offer the audience some guesswork. But the first feature written and directed by Kevin S. Tenney is as moribund as any Ouija I've ever seen. There is a romantic triangle in the background: Brandon, a rich, handsome, unnaturally blond young man; Linda, his former lover, and Jim, Brandon's former best friend who happens to be Linda's present lover. In the greatest stretch of imagination the film calls for, we're asked to believe Jim did not steal Linda away from Brandon. Right. When Brandon brings his Ouija to a party at Jim and Linda's, they tune in a mass murderer named Malfeitor (''evildoer'' in Portuguese, the film says) disguised as the spirit of a little boy killed 30 years before. Malfeitor possesses Linda until the two men in her life end their feud and team up to save her. This film is so cheaply made that its grand special effect has a knife fly through the kitchen, and a conveniently open bottle of ketchup tips itself over; the ketchup drips on the knife to resemble blood, which the astute Linda takes as a bad sign. The dialogue is so unreal that when Jim tells his landlady (in a cameo by Rose Marie; I don't know why) to call an ambulance for Linda, instead of running for the phone she stops to ask, ''Why, what happened?'' The plot is so predictable that when the Ouija slowly spells out its answers, the scenes are less suspenseful than ''Wheel of Fortune.'' One good thing I can say about ''Witchboard,'' which opened Friday at the Criterion Center and other theaters: Todd Allen as Jim doesn't overact. (Steven Nichols, as Brandon, and Tawny Kitaen, as Linda, do.) The very best I can say is that ''Witchboard'' should encourage struggling film makers. Watch it and think, ''I can do better than that!'' OLD BLACK MAGIC WITCHBOARD, directed and written by Kevin S. Tenney; director of photography, Roy H. Wagner; edited by Daniel Duncan and Stephen J.

1987-03-22T00:00:00Z,"''A WOMAN FROM THE PROVINCES'' finally works almost in spite of itself. The Polish movie, which will be shown at the Museum of Modern Art tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 6 P.M., creates a mosaic of a woman who did nothing more special than live out an arduous existence in a village. It takes a while, but the director, Andrzej Baranski, finds the truth in the truism that every closely observed life is extraordinary. His screenplay, based on a novel by Waldemar Sieminski, begins with Andzia at age 60 watching television in a comfortable house and relecting chattily on everyday pleasures. We learn, in flashbacks, that she was widowed young and left with two babies; until late in life she had to do menial work to get by. Andzia is a survivor, without histrionics. Gradually, memories from a half-century come together to create this woman from the provinces. The tone is as subdued as the faded and sometimes fuzzy color; for a stretch or two you may find yourself growing impatient, but the unhurried pace, the unpressured manner prove faithful to the material."

1987-03-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Le Corbusier never built a building in England. Yet his influence in this country far exceeded that in France, where he lived for most of his adult life.

They say it has nothing to do with adopting a tri-state outlook and posing as the metropolitan-area baseball team in the wake of their World Series championship, but they would prefer a new corporate logo.

This was ''Intimations,'' a one-act opera based on a poem by David Madden. This ''maybe she did, maybe she didn't'' tale of murder and frustration seemed shrill and rather sordid, learned but conventional in its musical Modernism, despite the expressive performances by Susan Faust Straley and Cynthia Dewey."
1987-03-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Perhaps you believe that a grand jury, at the urging of a special prosecutor, has indicted Michael Deaver for peddling influence - specifically, for breaking the ethics in government law, which restricts former Government officials from immediately lobbying their ex-colleagues."

1987-03-23T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: CABARET singers who combine contemporary pop songs with vintage standards often find themselves on one or the other side of the fence. Either they connect emotionally to the older material and are uncomfortable with the new or vice versa.
