1897-02-27T00:00:00Z,I read with interest the dispatch from Washington in THE NEW YORK TIMES in regard to the valuable manuscripts stolen from the Congressional Library.

No matter what form it takes, whether it is left vague enough to cause misunderstanding between the Executive and the Senate, or whether it be made perfectly definite and self-operating, it is a foolish amendment.

Troops of mastodons wandered over the land and gorged themselves on the soft twigs of spruce and fir. The slow, lumbering, woolly rhinoceros wallowed in the muddy streams and lakes.

Recourse must be had either to deep wells or the drinking water must be boiled. The experience of the town of Hawkinsville, Ga., will well illustrate this point. This thrifty little manufacturing city was located unfortunately in a malarial section."

The Superintendents of both say that, while another hospital is not needed, a home for incurable cases, where patients could get an abundance of fresh air and have their cases treated daily, would be a great charity and great blessing."

1897-07-17T00:00:00Z,"-- A good many persons who do not take a deep interest in yachting may be puzzled by the names applied to pleasure craft in the racing classes. The yachtsmen themselves would no doubt be at a loss to account for the fact that with one accord they selected fanciful and freakish names for the vessels of the fanciful and freakish classes, while the larger and more elegant craft have received more pretentious names."

1897-07-18T00:00:00Z,"SUPERIOR, Wis., July 17. -- A new method of traveling has been invented by hobos. It is much easier than the old tie walking system, and it obviates the necessity of inconvenient and dangerous truck riding, but it is not every hobo that can travel the new way.

1897-07-18T00:00:00Z,"The Roman pontiffs corrupted the calendar rolls -- for instance, ordaining special intercalculated days to favor a moneyed friend who wished to retain office.
