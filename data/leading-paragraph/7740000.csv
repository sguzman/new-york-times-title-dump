2013-11-10T00:00:00Z,"McCLENNEN--Edward Francis II, 77. Died November 2, 2013. Professor of Philosophy, Edward F. McClennen was a passionate thinker and an unrepentant liberal. He contributed foundational work to the field of decision and game theory with over fifty articles and the highly influential book Rationality and Dynamic Choice: Foundational Explorations (Cambridge University Press, 1990). He was truly an original philosopher who defended an unorthodox conception of rationality in the face of traditional theories of decision and game theory. He was a 'maverick' in his field, as he would say. Ned believed that people could achieve extraordinary things by cooperating and devoted his later years to integrating economics and political philosophy in the service of a theory of a just civil society and government-- a Rational Society, the title of his book manuscript. Born in Cambridge MA, August 16, 1936, Ned received a BA in philosophy from The University of Michigan in 1959 and a PhD from The Johns Hopkins University in 1968. He taught at Purdue University, Lehman College CUNY, Washington University, Bowling Green State University, The London School of Economics, and Syracuse University and was a visiting professor at Harvard University, The University of Pittsburgh, Rutgers University, The University of Rochester, The University of Western Ontario, and The University of Amsterdam. At Bowling Green as the Ohio Board of Regents Eminent Scholar in Moral and Social Philosophy, he was co-developer of a program funded by UNESCO, the Kennan Institute and others that brought young Central and Eastern European scholars to the US after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a means helping them understand the relevance of new institutional economic theory for their reemerging nations. As Centennial Professor of Philosophy at The London School of Economics, he designed and administered a highly successful interdisciplinary Masters Program in Philosophy, Policy and Social Values. From 2005-2007 he participated in a group of international scholars who were brought to Libya by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi to help in the writing of a new Constitution, for which Ned drafted the Bill of Rights. As many would attest, Ned was a gracious host who loved company. He enjoyed cooking fine food to share with others over long evenings of spirited conversation. He also loved art, a legacy from the George De Forest Brush side of the family, and he treasured the view of Pleasant Bay from the McClennen family home on Cape Cod. He is survived by his wife Ellen Esrock and his children, Nathaniel Esrock McClennen and Sarah Pearmain McClennen."

2013-11-11T00:00:00Z,"KAGAN Saul, was the architect of Holocaust compensation and restitution for Jewish victims of Nazism and their families. Saul spent his entire adult life pursuing, and attaining, a small measure of justice for Shoah victims. For 70 years, Saul made it his life's calling to compel Germany, Austria and other entities to acknowledge victims' suffering and restore stolen assets. From the time he created a restitution unit of the US Army in postwar Germany, Saul participated in every major negotiation and achievement of this historic endeavor. He led the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany for 47 years and continued to be its invaluable advisor after retiring as Executive Vice President. Saul was the major architect of $80 billion in pensions and compensation payments; billions more in homecare, food, and medicine for survivors; establishment of the first fund for Righteous Gentiles; fund for displaced community rabbis from Europe; and funds for Holocaust memory such as the creation of Yad Vashem in Israel and the first Holocaust memorial and documentation center in Europe. Yet despite the immensity of his achievements, modesty and humility were his hallmarks. Quietly, with little fanfare, Saul negotiated, navigated and built. He saw opportunities before others could understand that they were there; he was a visionary in every sense of the word. Lives were transformed because Saul saw what was possible and he pursued it unrelentingly, one step at a time.It was always about making something happen, finding the way through, solving the problem it was never about him. All that mattered was that the cause was right and that the result would benefit those who needed the most. He proved that courage and faith can infuse daily events with historical significance, and he understood when historical events could make the unimaginable possible. Saul both created history through his efforts and used history to create new possibilities. Throughout the decades, Saul was the Claims Conferences leader, its historian, and the voice for those who suffered beyond measure. Survivors have lost a champion and we have lost a beloved and wise friend. Our deepest sympathies are with his dear wife, Eleanor, daughter Julia, step-children Jonathan and Emily Lobatto, and his family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Julius Berman, Chairman; Greg Schneider, Executive Vice President; Roman Kent, Treasurer; Reuven Merhav, Chairman of the Executive Committee; Officers, Board, and Staff Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany"

Born in Lincoln, NE, and raised there and in Omaha and in Gretna, NE, Bill graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a Journalism degree and quickly landed on Madison Avenue in the '70s as an account manager for Burson-Marsteller, which later joined Young & Rubicam. Bill was a real-life ""Mad Man,"" but unlike the TV characters, he was a colleague characterized by integrity, class and an easygoing Midwestern charm. Later in his career, Bill worked as a consultant for Merrill Lynch, and for InterCommunications(R), the successful Newport Beach marketing firm founded by his wife. Bill enjoyed playing golf and tennis with his family, and taking frequent family vacations to Hawaii and Lake Tahoe. Bill rarely missed a televised sporting event (especially if his Nebraska Cornhuskers were playing). Those who knew Bill remember him as an intelligent, worldly and considerate man who was always quick with a smile and a few insightful words of wisdom on just about any topic.

2013-11-12T00:00:00Z,"PETTUS--Susan Fouke, of Seabrook Island, SC, and New York City died November 8, 2013, after a brave battle with ovarian cancer. Known as Susie, she was born December 15, 1943, and grew up in St. Louis, MO. The daughter of the late John Truman Fouke and Virginia Brown Fouke, she attended Mary Institute in St. Louis, graduated from Mt. Vernon Seminary and later Mt. Vernon Junior College. After graduating she moved to New York City and attended Pace School to study art. In 1968 she married Thruston W. Pettus and was a devoted wife for 45 years as well as a loving mother of Katherine Pettus Wujcik (Mark) and Thruston W. Pettus, Jr. She is also survived by her beloved brother, John T. Fouke, Jr. (Sharon), a niece, Penny Fouke Brobyn and a nephew, John T. Fouke III (Kelly). Susie dedicated the better part of her life to her immediate family, but she also held a special place in her heart for those cousins she grew up with in St. Louis, particularly the late Claude Fouke Benoist (Walter), Lucien R. Fouke (Becky) and Thomas C. Fouke (Linda). Susie was indefinable; shy yet playful, private yet approachable, quiet yet profound, demanding yet forgiving. She did not suffer fools and was quick to express her opinions, politically correct or not. Although she spent the later part of her life in Seabrook Island, her heart never left New York City where the theaters, museums and human diversity provided her with a steady diet of enlightenment and joy. Susie was an accomplished artist who painted for the pleasure it brought her, not the recognition. She was a collector of contemporary art and antiques, and her artistic skills and color sense carried over into interior decorating and designing elaborate holiday centerpieces. Susie adored animals, domestic and wild, and pity the person she caught stepping on a palmetto bug or harming an animal. She loved to travel and being blessed by a sacred elephant in India and kissed by a giraffe in Kenya were typical of her joyous abandon. Her family and friends know they have lost a truly unique person whose love, dignity, beauty and compassion will be irreplaceable. Services in St. Louis will be private. Arrangements made by J. Henry Stuhr West Ashley Chapel, 3360 Glenn McConnell Parkway, Charleston, SC. In lieu of flowers contributions can be made to the International Crane Foundation, NW 6469, P.O. Box 1450, Minneapolis, MN 55485-6469 or the Central Park Conservancy, 14 E. 60th Street, New York, NY 10020, in her memory."

A champion of the Jewish People, the modest demeanor of this gracious, good man could not hide the magnitude of his achievements in securing a measure of justice for those whose pain was beyond measure.

2013-11-12T00:00:00Z,"KAGAN Saul, was the architect of Holocaust compensation and restitution for Jewish victims of Nazism and their families. Saul spent his entire adult life pursuing, and attaining, a small measure of justice for Shoah victims. For 70 years, Saul made it his life's calling to compel Germany, Austria and other entities to acknowledge victims' suffering and restore stolen assets. From the time he created a restitution unit of the US Army in postwar Germany, Saul participated in every major negotiation and achievement of this historic endeavor. He led the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany for 47 years and continued to be its invaluable advisor after retiring as Executive Vice President. Saul was the major architect of $80 billion in pensions and compensation payments; billions more in homecare, food, and medicine for survivors; establishment of the first fund for Righteous Gentiles; fund for displaced community rabbis from Europe; and funds for Holocaust memory such as the creation of Yad Vashem in Israel and the first Holocaust memorial and documentation center in Europe. Yet despite the immensity of his achievements, modesty and humility were his hallmarks. Quietly, with little fanfare, Saul negotiated, navigated and built. He saw opportunities before others could understand that they were there; he was a visionary in every sense of the word. Lives were transformed because Saul saw what was possible and he pursued it unrelentingly, one step at a time.It was always about making something happen, finding the way through, solving the problem it was never about him. All that mattered was that the cause was right and that the result would benefit those who needed the most. He proved that courage and faith can infuse daily events with historical significance, and he understood when historical events could make the unimaginable possible. Saul both created history through his efforts and used history to create new possibilities. Throughout the decades, Saul was the Claims Conferences leader, its historian, and the voice for those who suffered beyond measure. Survivors have lost a champion and we have lost a beloved and wise friend. Our deepest sympathies are with his dear wife, Eleanor, daughter Julia, step-children Jonathan and Emily Lobatto, and his family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Julius Berman, Chairman; Greg Schneider, Executive Vice President; Roman Kent, Treasurer; Reuven Merhav, Chairman of the Executive Committee; Officers, Board, and Staff Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany"

In “The Silence of the Lambs,” Hannibal Lecter quotes from The Meditations during a cellblock interrogation: “First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What does he do, this man you seek?”"

Mendel, at a benefit for the Dia Foundation in New York last year, the two, in fact, hit it off quite well. “I could immediately relate to him because my wife is French, and she is a big fan of his work,” Perez said. “He’s also architectural in terms of his lines, and I do a lot of paintings of architecture, so we had ground in common.” First, a friendship developed — and soon after, a collaboration. “I thought maybe I could do a portrait of him, but it would be about looking at his work through my eyes,” Perez explained. Mendel was into it and allowed Perez into his workroom, where the artist shot pictures of everything he saw — scraps of fabric, dresses on forms, fur garments being constructed — and then created a series of collages for his new book, “Gilles Mendel by Enoc Perez.”"

2013-11-17T00:00:00Z,"PETTUS--Susan Fouke, of Seabrook Island, SC, and New York City died November 8, 2013, after a brave battle with ovarian cancer. Known as Susie, she was born December 15, 1943, and grew up in St. Louis, MO. The daughter of the late John Truman Fouke and Virginia Brown Fouke, she attended Mary Institute in St. Louis, graduated from Mt. Vernon Seminary and later Mt. Vernon Junior College. After graduating she moved to New York City and attended Pace School to study art. In 1968 she married Thruston W. Pettus and was a devoted wife for 45 years as well as a loving mother of Katherine Pettus Wujcik (Mark) and Thruston W. Pettus, Jr. She is also survived by her beloved brother, John T. Fouke, Jr. (Sharon), a niece, Penny Fouke Brobyn and a nephew, John T. Fouke III (Kelly). Susie dedicated the better part of her life to her immediate family, but she also held a special place in her heart for those cousins she grew up with in St. Louis, particularly the late Claude Fouke Benoist (Walter), Lucien R. Fouke (Becky) and Thomas C. Fouke (Linda). Susie was indefinable; shy yet playful, private yet approachable, quiet yet profound, demanding yet forgiving. She did not suffer fools and was quick to express her opinions, politically correct or not. Although she spent the later part of her life in Seabrook Island, her heart never left New York City where the theaters, museums and human diversity provided her with a steady diet of enlightenment and joy. Susie was an accomplished artist who painted for the pleasure it brought her, not the recognition. She was a collector of contemporary art and antiques, and her artistic skills and color sense carried over into interior decorating and designing elaborate holiday centerpieces. Susie adored animals, domestic and wild, and pity the person she caught stepping on a palmetto bug or harming an animal. She loved to travel and being blessed by a sacred elephant in India and kissed by a giraffe in Kenya were typical of her joyous abandon. Her family and friends know they have lost a truly unique person whose love, dignity, beauty and compassion will be irreplaceable. Services in St. Louis will be private. Arrangements made by J. Henry Stuhr West Ashley Chapel, 3360 Glenn McConnell Parkway, Charleston, SC. In lieu of flowers contributions can be made to the International Crane Foundation, NW 6469, P.O.

2013-11-17T00:00:00Z,"DIMOND--E. Grey, a physician, medical educator, and an ""original"" door-opener to modern China died Sunday, November 3, 2013 at his home, Diastole, on Hospital Hill, in Kansas City, Missouri. He was 94. In 1970 the American journalist, Edgar Snow, wrote three articles for Norman Cousins' Saturday Review of Literature, describing his observations in his 1970 trip to the People's Republic of China. These articles dealt with birth control efforts in China, limb re-implantation, and acupuncture anesthesia. The information was original and prompted correspondence from critics declaring that Snow was not a proper observer, was not medically trained, and had apparently been either hoodwinked or was brain-washed by the Chinese. Snow asked his physician friend, Dimond, to go to China, make his observations and report on them. He arranged for an invitation to Dimond from Zhou Enlai. Dimond realized that the acceptance of his findings would be enhanced if his teacher, Paul Dudley White, then 85, could accompany him and bear witness, too. The Dimonds and the Whites arrived in China on September 15, 1971. In their party were the Dr. Sam Rosens and Dr. Victor Sidel of New York City. The four men were the first American physicians in China for 25 years. Their visit antedated Nixon's 1972 diplomatic opening to Communist China. Dimond wrote two articles for the Journal of The American Medical Association (JAMA) fully confirming Snow's findings. Dimond went on to bring the first Chinese physician delegation to the United States in 1972. Over the rest of his lifetime, he took physician and lay groups to China and found study places for Chinese physicians who began coming in numbers. Dimond made 40 trips to Asia, became an honorary professor of medicine at several Chinese medical schools, was for five years consultant to the national heart hospital, Beijing, and negotiated the publication of the Chinese edition of JAMA. He wrote two books, ""More than Herbs and Acupuncture"" (1975) and ""Inside China Today"" (1983), W.W Norton, describing his China observations. The first book covered his original trip in 1971, and the second was a biography of the American physician who became a Chinese citizen: George Hatem, (Ma Haide). Dimond's friendships in China gave him unusual access to events there. They included the former foreign minister, Huang Hua; the physician to the leadership, Wu Wei-jan; Rewi Alley, the New Zealander who made his life in China; and Ma Haide, who had joined the communists when they were still at Yenan. In 1980 Dimond and his wife, Mary Dwight Clark, adopted a Chinese daughter, an event that gave them pleasure and pride for the rest of their lives. His wife founded The Edgar Snow Memorial Fund and upon her death, Dimond took on the presidency for 20 years. The University of Missouri-Kansas City houses the Fund's large collection of papers and memorabilia of Edgar Snow. Dimond's observations in China convinced him that China was successfully returning to its historical role as a great nation. He believed that communism was a transitory happening and that the ancient civilization that is China would quietly become the modern China. He never wavered in this observation and often said, ""I enjoy the criticisms of contemporaries who are so buried in their hostility towards communism that they could not see the 'return' of China."" Dimond was the founder of the unique medical school at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. The School opened the same day Dimond entered China in 1971. Dimond's home, Diastole, was built near the School to honor his wife, Mary Clark Dimond, daughter of Grenville Clark. He gave the home to a private foundation and endowed it to advance the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He also gave the university his major collection of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. For ten years, beginning in 1950, he was at the University of Kansas School of Medicine and served there as the youngest chairman of medicine at any American medical school. After that he was director of the Institute for Cardiopulmonary Diseases at the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California. For a year and half he was special consultant on medical education to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington, D.C. Dimond is survived by his daughters, Sherri Grey Byrer of Terre Haute, Indiana; Lark Grey Dimond of Rancho Santa Fe, California; and Lea Grey Dimond of San Francisco, California; an adopted Chinese daughter, Dr. Joan Wu-Chang, three grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, and six great-great grandchildren. He was an only child, born in St. Louis, Missouri, December 8, 1918, on his mother's birthday. His father, Edmunds Grey Dimond, was a pharmaceutical chemist and a representative of Eli Lilly and Company. On both sides his American roots went back to Virginia, 130 years before the founding of the country. Dimond grew up during the Great Depression and obtained an education only by having a football scholarship to Purdue University. Dimond was active for years in the American College of Cardiology and at the time of his death was the oldest living president of the organization. At the University of Missouri he was UMKC Provost for the Health Sciences and statewide Distinguished Professor of Medicine. His ashes will be returned to the family cemetery in Winona, Mississippi. A memorial is to be held in Kansas City, on the campus of UMKC, on December 8, 1:00pm. Memorial contributions may be made to the E. Grey Dimond Memorial Fund c/o Diastole, 2501 Holmes Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64108."

Moukarzel’s hourlong piece, which was a sold-out hit in Dublin and London for the theater company Dead Centre, aims not so much to relive Proust’s epic, seven-volume story of social climbing, desire and memory as to distill its yearning, nostalgic essence into fragments of narrative and images. When the show begins, Moukarzel is running on a treadmill, his back to us, instantly conjuring images of being borne back ceaselessly into the past (or, stuck in the present). A giant diptych of Proust hangs overhead. Everywhere, there’s a clutter of half-opened packing boxes, marked cheekily with labels like “Mum,” “Apologies, “Bacon,” “Broken Glass” and (inevitably) “Madeleines.”"

2013-11-19T00:00:00Z,"REES--Thomas D.,MD. Thomas D. Rees, MD, FACS, 86, a distinguished and widely-honored plastic surgeon who also devoted much of his life to providing his skills and extensive medical care to the people of East Africa, passed away peacefully at his home in Santa Fe, NM, in the early evening hours of Thursday, November 14th, 2013. He follows his beloved wife, Nan, who passed away in May of 2012, his son David M. Rees, and is survived by his son Thomas D. Rees, Jr., daughter S. Elizabeth Rees, brother J. Richard Rees, MD, and numerous nieces and nephews. Dr. Rees was born in Nephi and raised in Salt Lake City, UT, the son of University of Utah professor Don M. Rees, PhD, and Norma A. Rees, and was a second generation descendent of Mormon pioneers from the south of Wales. He graduated from the University of Utah with a BA in 1946, and an MD in 1948, and from which he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2013. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1945, also served from 1957-1958, and was honorably discharged a Lt. Commander. Dr. Rees trained in general and plastic surgery at the Genesee Hospital in Rochester, NY, and The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York City, followed by a prestigious fellowship in plastic surgery at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, in Sussex, England. He was privileged to work under Sir Archibald McIndoe, a pioneering New Zealand plastic surgeon who was famous for his work on the RAF pilots largely credited with saving England in the Battle of Britain in WWII. During his fellowship, Dr. Rees was invited by Sir Archibald to visit his ranch in Kenya. While enjoying ""sundowners"" together with Sir Michael Wood (another fellow under Sir Archibald and a transplant to Kenya), the three surgeons founded the Flying Doctors of East Africa in 1957. The three founders flew into the bush to set up clinics in rural areas of East Africa to enable advanced medical care ranging from vaccinations to operating on and treating local patients with congenital deformities and other conditions requiring extensive surgery and reconstruction. Radio and TV personality Arthur Godfrey donated their first plane, and through worldwide fundraising and government aid, the three surgeons created the organization now known as AMREF (African Medical & Research Foundation), which has grown into Africa's largest health development NGO. Based in Nairobi, Kenya, AMREF has offices in 11 countries in North America and Europe. AMREF now employs more than 1,000 health professionals and experts, 97% African, with 90% living in the communities in which they work. Over the past five decades, AMREF has received numerous awards for its contributions to African health development. Most recent include the Gates Award for Global Health, recognizing organizations that have made an outstanding contribution to improving global health, especially in resource-poor settings, and the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Award, the world's largest humanitarian prize given to an organization that is significantly alleviating human suffering. Dr. Rees traveled to Africa annually and wrote a memoir about his experiences entitled ""Daktari: A Surgeon's Adventures with the Flying Doctors of East Africa."" Dr. Rees' contributions to the areas of plastic surgery techniques, education, and credibility cannot be overstated. He established his plastic and cosmetic surgery practice in New York City in 1957, at a time when there were only a handful of practicing plastic surgeons. With few exceptions, the field of plastic surgery was very insular in that most surgeons were fiercely protective of their techniques. Dr. Rees was only happy to open up his operating room to students, and he loved teaching and writing. He mentored thousands of fledgling plastic surgeons throughout his career; in his capacity as the Chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital from 1975-1992; directing the MEETH Aesthetic Surgery Fellowship; and teaching at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery of the NYU Langone Medical Center. For over 25 years, Dr. Rees organized and co-chaired an annual Symposium on Aesthetic Plastic Surgery in New York City. These symposia feature a faculty composed of surgeons of different disciplines and nationalities, and are attended by surgeons from all over the world. Dr. Rees was a Clinical Professor of Plastic Surgery at the New York University School of Medicine, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Plastic Surgery at MEETH, as well as a past president of the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, and a former director and vice-chairman of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. He was a frequent lecturer at medical institutions, symposia and forums all over the world, and the author of more than 140 medical articles and six medical texts, including the two-volume Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, long the bible for surgeons in training. Dr. Thomas Rees had many talents and interests that extended beyond medicine. He was a philanthropist, an avid fly fisherman in the west and saltwater and deep-sea fisherman in the east, a skier, at home on horseback, a jazz saxophonist who sat in with some of the best of his era. Upon retirement, he became an acclaimed sculptor in Santa Fe whose work reflected his experiences and feelings for the people, animals, and environment of Africa and his work was exhibited in 2009 at the Gerald Peters Gallery in Santa Fe. Dr. Rees' transformative surgical skills touched celebrities, political figures, heads of state and their families and the people of East Africa. In all of this, he was accompanied, encouraged, and supported by his adored wife Nan. His ashes will be joined with his wife's and scattered in their beloved East Africa. A memorial service will be announced and take place within the coming months. In his memory, contributions may be made to those organizations to which he committed so much of himself."

He was the consummate story teller and captivated his nieces and nephews with tales of the good times in the city that never sleeps. Butch's engaging humor, robust laughter and perpetual smile will be missed by his many admirers. Preceded in death by his sister, Barbara Hubbard Campbell, and brother, Otis Livingston Hubbard, he leaves behind six nieces and nephews, Otis L. Hubbard III, Laura H. Lucia, John K.

William (Bill) Walsh, Esq., a man of singular generosity and outstanding leadership in business died at Stanford University Hospital on Saturday, November 16, 2013. Born in New York on August 4, 1930, Bill was a graduate of Fordham University (1951) and Harvard Law School (1955). He began his career as an Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York where his arguments led to the prosecution of many organized crime figures of the 1950s including crime boss Vito Genovese. After six years he entered the private sector, first at McKinsey and Company and then heading to the west coast to join Arcata Corporation ending as President and CEO, later founding Sequoia Associates, LLC. There he forged partnerships and envisioned investment possibilities in corporate America which brought inestimable benefit to the country's economy and institutions. Bill took a deep interest in political, religious and educational matters in his country and the country of his heritage, Ireland. A committed and thoughtful philanthropist, he set standards that summoned up the best in others, and countless institutions have benefited from his generosity and leadership. Fordham University acquired a world class library (The William D. Walsh Family Library) and a classic antiquities museum, Harvard Law School built new state of the art classrooms, the Neuroscience Institute was given a new home for important study, the American Ireland Fund launched ground breaking programs in peace and reconciliation for the new generation, the government of Bolivia was a recipient of much needed medical supplies through his service as a Knight of Malta and served on the Board of Overseers at the Hoover Institution. Bill and his cherished wife Jane hosted Vintage Affaire, the annual fundraiser for the Vista Center, for many years at their home in Atherton. Sonoma Developmental Center which looked after his daughter, Caroline was another of his philanthropies. It was not simply financial support that he offered and inspired in others. Believing that time and talent should be given in equal measure with treasure, he served on the boards of these institutions, tirelessly offering his advice and inspiration. Bill had a great sense of fun and festivity, while being utterly committed to his friends and family. His greatest pride with Jane were his children: Deborah Hirsch (Peter), Michael Walsh (Barbara), Suzanne Tinsley (Ken), Tara Jane Arnold (Mark) and Peter Walsh (Melanie) and his 12 grandchildren: Timothy and Rebecca Hirsch, Patrick, Riley, Kevin, Brian, Megan, Sean, and Molly Tinsley, Spencer and Maxwell Arnold and Liam Walsh. Mr. Walsh is predeceased by his wife of 57 years and his daughter Caroline and is survived by his brother Donald G. Walsh of New Haven, Connecticut. A Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, November 22 at 11am at St. Raymond Catholic Church, 1100 Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo Park, CA. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made in Bill Walsh's memory to Parents Hospital Association in support of Sonoma Developmental Center, P.O. Box 237, Eldridge, CA 95431."

Hubbard, Jr., he attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut and then graduated from Yale University. Butch thrived in New York City in the 1970's and 1980's turning his attention to the bright lights of Broadway. He acted as co-producer of several musical productions, culminating with a 1992 Tony Award for the revival of Guys And Dolls. He was an inveterate reader and passionate traveler, but more than anything, Butch loved to be surrounded by family and friends and typically was the instigator and center of conversation. He was the consummate story teller and captivated his nieces and nephews with tales of the good times in the city that never sleeps. Butch's engaging humor, robust laughter and perpetual smile will be missed by his many admirers. Preceded in death by his sister, Barbara Hubbard Campbell, and brother, Otis Livingston Hubbard, he leaves behind six nieces and nephews, Otis L. Hubbard III, Laura H. Lucia, John K. Hubbard, James O. Campbell, Nick M. Campbell, Turia C. Gumpert. A private memorial service will be held on Friday, November 22, 2013. In lieu of flowers, please consider donations to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (220 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60604) and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (20 N. Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60606).

Under Dr. Rees' direction the MEETH Plastic Surgery Department and the Aesthetic Surgery Fellowship, which he began, became the leading aesthetic surgery service in the world. He was one of the first to openly teach the art and science of aesthetic surgery, an area that had previously been shrouded in secrecy. His numerous textbooks, scientific publications and lectures had a profound impact on the specialty. He was respected and loved by all but especially the Residents and Fellows he generously engaged. Dr. Rees was known and respected all over the world as a great surgeon and humanitarian. His annual trips to Kenya where he started The Flying Doctors of East Africa and the African Medical Education Research Foundation were among his most cherished accomplishments. Thirty-three years ago, with Dr. Rees as the dominant force, we established the annual Cutting Edge Aesthetic Surgery Symposium in New York for the highly specialized teaching of aesthetic surgery. The 2013 meeting will take place in ten days and will be attended by plastic surgeons from all over the world. Dr. Rees, the honorary Chairman, will be honored with the first Thomas D. Rees Lecture, which was previously scheduled. We honor his legacy and the positive impact he made on so many lives.

2013-11-22T00:00:00Z,"PAGE--Shelby H.,92, a resident of Hilton Head Island, SC, passed away at his home Friday, November 15, 2013. He was born in New York City to Frank C. and Anna H. Page. Growing up mostly in Lawrence, NY. He was a champion diver at the Lawrence Beach Club and started his lifelong love affair with golf at the Rockaway Hunting Club, where he won the Junior Boys Championship in 1939. He attended Milton Academy and then Harvard University, class of '43. At Harvard, he was manager of the football team, helping the coaches diagram plays from high atop the stadium. After Harvard, he joined the army, and on completion of basic training at Camp Hood, served at the Pentagon and then in Honolulu, and was honorably discharged as a second lieutenant. In 1949, he joined the then Hewitt Ogilvy Benson and Mather as Treasurer with 'twelve other optimistic souls in a ratty office on Madison Avenue.' As Ogilvy and Mather grew, he missed the unstructured confusion and easy camaraderie of a startup, but was proud of being a part of what he called, 'the best international advertising agency in the world.' In 1950, he met the wonderful Roberta Raworth, and they married in 1951. Their son Frank was born in 1957. During the 60's and 70's, he was a member of the board and treasurer of the Rockaway Hunting Club in Lawrence, NY and became President of the Lawrence Beach Club. Shelby retired from Ogilvy and Mather as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in 1983 after 34 years. At the time, a colleague wrote that he was a 'source of good fun, inspiration, and integrity for all of us' at Ogilvy and Mather. In 1987, Shelby and Robby moved to Hilton Head where Shelby continued to play golf as a member of the Bear Creek Golf Club and bridge with his buddies from Long Cove, Bear Creek, and Cyprus. He also enjoyed travel, cruising to six of the seven continents. In Hilton Head, he participated in Meals on Wheels and supported Volunteers in Medicine and the Deep Wells Project.

2013-11-22T00:00:00Z,"NEMIROVSKY--Shlomit, long time resident of Forest Hills, NY and more recently of Palo Alto, CA, passed away on November 17, 2013 at the age of 84. Shlomit was born in Botosani, Romania, the fifth of six children of Zeev and Pnina Frenkel. At an early age, she and her family moved to Bacau. The immediate family managed to survive WWII, as the children were smuggled, one by one, to Israel. She arrived in 1943, participated in the 1948 Israeli War of Independence while stationed in the Negev Desert, and later trained as a nurse and worked at Rambam Hospital in Haifa, specializing in pediatrics. She met Samuel Nemirovsky and they were married in 1954. In 1962, they moved to New York. Shlomit made a wonderful home for Sam and their two sons while running a travel agency. The couple moved to Palo Alto in 2012. Shlomit and Sam enjoyed travel, theater, ballet, museums, opera, playful disagreements, and spending time with their grandchildren. Among the charities which Shlomit supported were St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, North Shore Animal League America, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. For Shlomit, her family was her life. Everyone who knew her will miss her fiery spirit, candor, warmth, and mischievous sense of humor. We will cherish her memory. She is survived by her husband, Samuel, her sons, Ofer and Gady, their wives, Shelly and Diana, and her grandchildren, Genevieve, William, Eric, Daniela, and Zachary. A memorial service to celebrate Shlomit's life will be held at 2:30pm on November 30th, at the Moldaw Residences at 899 East Charleston Road in Palo Alto, CA. The service will be held in room F401 on the fourth floor of the Cultural Arts Hall. Donations in her honor may be made to Mission Hospice in San Mateo."

2013-11-23T00:00:00Z,"REES--Dr. Thomas D. AMREF USA, the board members and AMREF worldwide staff mourn the loss of our co-founder, Dr. Thomas D. Rees, remarkable visionary and renowned surgeon, who passed away at his home in Santa Fe, NM on Thursday, November 14. Dr. Rees was a Clinical Professor of Plastic Surgery at New York University School of Medicine, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and served for many years as surgeon to the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center. He was a past President of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and a former Director and vice-chairman of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. In the shadow of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Dr. Rees and two other surgeons, Dr. Archibald McIndoe and Dr. Michael Wood, had an inspired idea: to bring urgently needed clinical and surgical care to the people in East Africa's most remote and underserved regions. Their plan was to utilize small aircraft and radios to reach these inaccessible areas - and thus the Flying Doctors of East Africa was born in 1957. This initial plan expanded over the years to include health education, training, and public health programs for a wide spectrum of health challenges in remote areas of Africa, as well as urban slums. Today, that vision is AMREF, (the African Medical & Research Foundation), the largest African-led health development organization, working in more than 30 African countries. In the United States, Dr. Rees continued what would be a life-long commitment to Africa and its people. He worked tirelessly for AMREF and the continent in many ways: serving as the Chair of the Board of the US affiliate of AMREF, fundraising and by promoting AMREF's work at every opportunity. Almost every year, Dr. Rees and his wife Nan travelled back to the continent, because they cared so passionately about the African people. Dr. Rees' dedication and enthusiasm were contagious. We are terribly saddened by his passing and extend our deep condolences to his children Liz, a board member of AMREF USA, his son Thomas, Jr and his entire family."

After a lecture at Harvard Business School, Steiner was appointed Senior Staff Economist at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Steiner authored over 40 articles in scholarly journals in antitrust, economics, marketing and advertising. His books include Visions of Cable Vision, 1972.

2013-11-24T00:00:00Z,"REES--Dr. Thomas D. AMREF USA, the board members and AMREF worldwide staff mourn the loss of our co-founder, Dr. Thomas D. Rees, remarkable visionary and renowned surgeon, who passed away at his home in Santa Fe, NM on Thursday, November 14. Dr. Rees was a Clinical Professor of Plastic Surgery at New York University School of Medicine, Chairman Emeritus of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and served for many years as surgeon to the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center. He was a past President of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and a former Director and vice-chairman of the American Board of Plastic Surgery. In the shadow of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Dr. Rees and two other surgeons, Dr. Archibald McIndoe and Dr. Michael Wood, had an inspired idea: to bring urgently needed clinical and surgical care to the people in East Africa's most remote and underserved regions. Their plan was to utilize small aircraft and radios to reach these inaccessible areas - and thus the Flying Doctors of East Africa was born in 1957. This initial plan expanded over the years to include health education, training, and public health programs for a wide spectrum of health challenges in remote areas of Africa, as well as urban slums. Today, that vision is AMREF, (the African Medical & Research Foundation), the largest African-led health development organization, working in more than 30 African countries. In the United States, Dr. Rees continued what would be a life-long commitment to Africa and its people. He worked tirelessly for AMREF and the continent in many ways: serving as the Chair of the Board of the US affiliate of AMREF, fundraising and by promoting AMREF's work at every opportunity. Almost every year, Dr. Rees and his wife Nan travelled back to the continent, because they cared so passionately about the African people. Dr. Rees' dedication and enthusiasm were contagious. We are terribly saddened by his passing and extend our deep condolences to his children Liz, a board member of AMREF USA, his son Thomas, Jr and his entire family."

2013-11-24T00:00:00Z,"GIBBINS--Robert L. (Bob), Bob Gibbins was a pre-eminent trial attorney with an international reputation as a master in the courtroom. Bob Gibbins was also a man of intense kindness and goodwill. He was born on February 27, 1936 in Seminole, Oklahoma and died peacefully and gracefully at his home in Vermont on November 19, 2013 at the age of 77. He attended high school in Oklahoma until he left to serve in the Army. After finishing his tour in Korea, he entered the University of Texas, earned his undergraduate degree and then attended the University of Texas School of Law--all of this accomplished in a mere four years. After obtaining his law degree, Bob relocated to Plainview, Texas where he began his stellar career. His courtroom skill was quickly recognized. Bob was one of those rare courtroom talents who mesmerized juries with his good looks, deep voice, wry humor, lightning-quick intelligence and his ability to communicate with them, not talk at them. Moving his first wife and four children to practice in Austin in the early 1970'+s was a difficult decision, but a fortuitous one. Here he was able to become a truly extraordinary trial lawyer. Years after moving to Austin, Bob met the love of his life, a successful attorney named Pam Reed. Theirs was a pairing of two powerful, ambitious, larger than life personalities. During his decades long career he served as President of the American Trial Lawyers Association, Director Emeritus of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, and President of the Travis County Trial Lawyers Association. He was a Fellow of the International Society of Barristers, the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, and the Texas Bar Foundation. He founded the Travis County chapter of American Board of Trial Advocates. His many honors included The Annual War Horse Award from the Southern Trial Lawyers Association, and the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Champion of Justice Award from the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Bob's life changed forever, beginning in 1996. He began an incredibly difficult yet amazingly graceful 17-year battle with temporal frontal lobe dementia. Gradually, the tough attorney facade gave way to the gentle man. He spent those years as the sweetest possible person, loving completely his partner and patient care-giver, Pam Reed. Theirs has been a love story both tragic and grand. In addition to Pam, Bob is survived by the other true loves of his life, his four children and their spouses, eleven grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, his sister, his mother- and father-in-law, his sister-in-law, her husband and her children, and his brother-in-law."

He was 65. Doug grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and attended Deerfield Academy and Princeton University. He began his banking career at Morgan Stanley, earned his MBA at Harvard, and in 1978 joined Brown Brothers Harriman. Doug was 29 when he took over Brown Brothers' then struggling Philadelphia office. He stayed for 32 years, becoming a partner and transforming the office into a significant factor in the company's success. He was an innovative manager, encouraging his team to collaborate across different lines of business--an approach that influenced firm-wide practices. Doug was especially happy about his role as mentor to generations of young bankers. His many friends and colleagues at Brown Brothers remember him as thoughtful, compassionate and fiercely loyal to both the people he managed and the interests of the firm's clients. Doug played a leading role in Philadelphia's philanthropic community for three decades. He served on the boards of more than 20 different non-profit organizations, primarily in the fields of land preservation and natural history research. Doug loved Africa. His support of girl's education in Kenya involved many trips to that country, and led to his induction as an Elder of the nomadic Samburu tribe. His care for the planet and its inhabitants also included his seven dogs. They loved and trusted him in return. Doug planned to devote his retirement to his African work, but his illness intervened. He retired in 2011 to spend his remaining time with his wife, Jane Walker, and his three children, Olivia, Colin and Madeline."

Lewis, one of the leading lights of the philanthropic world, and a dear friend and longtime supporter of the ACLU. As one of America's great patriots, Peter was single-mindedly committed to the values of equality, fairness and justice--values that guided his stewardship of Progressive Insurance as well as his personal giving. As a proud card-carrying member of the ACLU for close to four decades, Peter's generous support of our programs transformed America into a more perfect union. He was an outspoken opponent of the so-called War on Drugs, and pushed vigorously for the legalization of marijuana; the ACLU's drug policy work would not exist at the level it does today without his generous support and inspired vision. Peter's support extended to civil liberties efforts in state legislative battlegrounds across the country, furthering the fight for racial justice, immigration reform and marriage equality.

2013-11-26T00:00:00Z,"COOKE--Anne Elizabeth Ryan, passed from this world early on Saturday, November 23, 2013; she had been resting at her home in Williamsburg, VA since August. Anne, Senior Vice President of Emblem Health, a New York based Health insurance Company, had been living and working in NYC for a little over a year. After a successful career with AT&T, she retired in 1998 to pursue other interests, including a short period with Michigan Consolidate Gas and Gen Three in Boston. Anne then came to the Healthcare industry with leadership positions at WellPoint, where she was responsible for the rollout of their Medicare Part D product, then DaVita Inc. with their Home Healthcare Division and finally with Emblem Health where she was responsible for Operations and IT. Anne remained in NYC during Hurricane Sandy to help keep Emblem's IT systems operational as power was lost and backups restored. She is survived by her husband of 23 years, Bruce Cooke, daughter, Victoria Cooke, Williamsburg, VA and sisters, Mary Nell Ryan, Milwaukee, WI, and Jeanne Ryan, Duluth, MN. Anne grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, was a nationally ranked swimmer in high school, and then attended St. Catherine University, St. Paul, MN, graduating in 1980 with honors and member of Phi Beta Kappa. Anne felt her greatest work satisfaction came in the Health Industry; a colleague who worked with her at Emblem can best describe her in the quote below: ""Anne was inspirational, honest, and genuine. In speaking with many other people about Anne they each felt important and full of purpose after meeting her and hearing her vigor for life and dedication to transforming our organization. And she did just that; transform it. She held others accountable and required nothing but the best from each of us. I am a better person and stronger leader because of her. God bless.""

As a proud card-carrying member of the ACLU for close to four decades, Peter's generous support of our programs transformed America into a more perfect union. He was an outspoken opponent of the so-called War on Drugs, and pushed vigorously for the legalization of marijuana; the ACLU's drug policy work would not exist at the level it does today without his generous support and inspired vision. Peter's support extended to civil liberties efforts in state legislative battlegrounds across the country, furthering the fight for racial justice, immigration reform and marriage equality. His enormous generosity enabled the ACLU to purchase a building named The Peter B. Lewis Center for Civil Liberties for the organization's expanding Washington Legislative Office, and to conclude our endowment fund, even in difficult economic times. The ACLU is honored to be one of the philanthropies that measured up to Peter's high standards, and we honor his memory every day by continuing to fight for the more just and free society he envisioned. His belief in the underdog and his commitment to righting wrongs made him a benefactor to millions of Americans whom he never met but about whom he cared deeply. Peter Lewis epitomized the best of our country's values and we will miss him greatly. Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director"

2013-11-28T00:00:00Z,"MANSON--Florence Sando, A pioneering woman newscaster in radio and the early years of television journalism who hosted Pittsburgh's TV Show ""The Florence Manson Show,"" died on November 25, 2013 at her home in Riverdale, New York at age 95 from complications related to dementia. Florence was born in 1918 and she graduated from Westminster College in 1939 and received her Master's Degree in Drama from Case Western Reserve the following year. Florence broke out of the usual confines of gossip and fashion coverage that women broadcasters were relegated to, spending 18 years as a popular on air Pittsburghbased personality. In her era when women broadcasters were usually expected to keep their shows light and frothy, Florence Sando tackled the leading hard news of the day in a career that ran from 1941 to 1959. Longtime viewers of Pittsburgh TV stations with signals that broadcast up and down the East Coast and into the Midwest would remember her for ""The Florence Manson Show,"" which featured her as a host-interviewer, a pioneering use of that format. She interviewed well known public figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt (on radio) as well as celebrities on tv such as Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong. Some of these interviews are available at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York. She also produced the earlier hard news breakthrough ""Women's Angle"" a 15 minute morning broadcast. Sando's ""Women's Angle"" spoke to women as adults, presenting news of the world, rather than the low-brow mix of fashion and decorating tips dished out to female audiences until then. ""It was easy when the news was about Madame Chiang Kai-shek, or the ten bestdressed women, or Mrs. Roosevelt or Senator Margaret Chase Smith..."" Sando told author and educator and former broadcaster Lynn Boyd Hinds in ""Broadcasting the Local News- The Early Years of Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV."" She was so popular with the Pittsburgh area audience that KDKA-TV asked her in 1957 to host ""The Florence Manson Show,"" now using her married name after her wedding to film executive Arthur Manson. Her tv shows were always committed to public service as well as entertainment. She cooperated with government, civic, social and cultural agencies in support of the war effort during World War II and presented stories and interviews which contributed to Pittsburgh's post war development. The show had a successful run until Florence and Arthur moved to New York in 1959. Mrs. Manson remained active in theater and community affairs in New York City. She was a member of the Board of Ensemble Studio Theatre. She also served as a member of the Board of Riverdale Neighborhood House as well as serving as an Elder of the Riverdale Presbyterian Church. Florence is survived by her husband, Arthur, her daughter Cynthia Ann and son-in-law Jeffrey Faville, and their children James and Catherine and her son Anthony, her daughter-in-law Angela and their children, Daniel, William and Timothy. A memorial service will be held at the Riverdale Presbyterian Church on December 7th at 11:00am. Please send donations to The Riverdale Presbyterian Church at 4765 Henry Hudson Parkway West. Bronx, NY 10471."

2013-11-29T00:00:00Z,"NELSON--Otto E.,1908-2013. Otto Nelson, esteemed photographer of fine art, whose clients included the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Asia Society, Japan Society, the Sackler and Freer Museums, and the private collections of David Rockefeller, Mary Burke and Malcolm Forbes died peacefully on November 17, of natural causes. He was 105. Nelson was renowned for the intelligence and respect with which he captured the objects and people he recorded, and for the simple elegance of his photographs. Throughout his long career, his beloved wife Marguerite did the printing, and the feisty photographer and his ever-gracious, Alsatian partner charmed their clients, family and friends as both bohemian couple and team. Born in Freiburg, Germany in the tumultuous years preceding the first World War, Nelson's career was shaped by art school in Berlin and years in Paris, where he fled Hitler and met his wife, and by their narrow and difficult escape to Switzerland and emigration to the U.S. With the help of friends and relatives, they settled in New York and established Nelson's career as a professional photographer. Before cultivating his niche in Asian, Islamic, and Ancient western art, Nelson photographed for a number of private schools and labor unions. He also photographed contemporary art in the Sixties, working for the Betty Parsons, Emmerich and Sydney Janis galleries, and sustaining longer relationships with such artists as Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, Wallase Ting and Nell Blaine. A lifelong dedicatee of classical music and opera, he also made a series of portraits of such luminaries as Nathan Milstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Toscanini, and the famed Spanish pianist, Alicia de la Rocha. A highlight of his career was an invitation in the late Sixties to photograph in the famed Topkapi palace, in a library untouched for hundreds of years. Nelson had no children. He is survived by his niece, Ruth Norden, her daughter, Linda, and grandchildren, Luke and Alec Joyner, and by extended family in the UK, France and Israel, all of whom will miss him dearly."

Polly passed away surrounded by her family and beloved French bulldogs, Reggie and Meg.

See Dad in his muscle t-shirt at www.Dadadad.com/ He was a welder in the Brooklyn Navy Yard during WWII, later a bookbinder, a union man at Blumberg, where Dad produced faster, and with higher quality than the machines.

2013-12-01T00:00:00Z,"NELSON--Otto E.,1908-2013. Otto Nelson, esteemed photographer of fine art, whose clients included the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Asia Society, Japan Society, the Sackler and Freer Museums, and the private collections of David Rockefeller, Mary Burke and Malcolm Forbes died peacefully on November 17, of natural causes. He was 105. Nelson was renowned for the intelligence and respect with which he captured the objects and people he recorded, and for the simple elegance of his photographs. Throughout his long career, his beloved wife Marguerite did the printing, and the feisty photographer and his ever-gracious, Alsatian partner charmed their clients, family and friends as both bohemian couple and team. Born in Freiburg, Germany in the tumultuous years preceding the first World War, Nelson's career was shaped by art school in Berlin and years in Paris, where he fled Hitler and met his wife, and by their narrow and difficult escape to Switzerland and emigration to the U.S. With the help of friends and relatives, they settled in New York and established Nelson's career as a professional photographer. Before cultivating his niche in Asian, Islamic, and Ancient western art, Nelson photographed for a number of private schools and labor unions. He also photographed contemporary art in the Sixties, working for the Betty Parsons, Emmerich and Sydney Janis galleries, and sustaining longer relationships with such artists as Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, Wallase Ting and Nell Blaine. A lifelong dedicatee of classical music and opera, he also made a series of portraits of such luminaries as Nathan Milstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Toscanini, and the famed Spanish pianist, Alicia de la Rocha. A highlight of his career was an invitation in the late Sixties to photograph in the famed Topkapi palace, in a library untouched for hundreds of years. Nelson had no children. He is survived by his niece, Ruth Norden, her daughter, Linda, and grandchildren, Luke and Alec Joyner, and by extended family in the UK, France and Israel, all of whom will miss him dearly."

2013-12-01T00:00:00Z,"MEHRAN--Masud, passed away November 26th after a short illness at his home in Atherton, California-- surrounded, as he was during his life, by his family. Masud was born in Tehran February 6, 1920 and attended the American College in Tehran. At the age of 22 he married Maryam Ansari, and they immigrated to New York two years later. There, Masud attended Columbia University and Cornell University, from which he graduated with a degree in Agricultural Economics in 1946. Curious to explore their newly adopted country, Masud and Maryam traveled to each of the then 48 states, finally settling in the Montclair neighborhood of Oakland. Eager to contribute to the dynamic growth of post-war California, Masud founded the Sunset Development Company in 1951 and began building homes in the city of Livermore-- eventually developing SunsetTown, one of the largest and most successful residential real estate projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1978, Masud expanded Sunset's properties by purchasing a 585 acre portion of the Bishop Ranch in San Ramon. Over the next 35 years he transformed an orchard into a vibrant business community comprising more than 10 million square feet of world-class office space and facilities. Masud was active in a variety of industry and community organizations with far reaching benefits for the entire San Francisco Bay Region. These include The Urban Land Institute, Golden Gate University, Oakland's Children's Hospital, The Boy Scouts of America, and countless others. After his divorce from Maryam in 1978, Masud married Farideh Eshragi in 1987. The couple had homes in Atherton, San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, where they regularly entertained and enjoyed being with their family and friends. Masud had four children with his first wife, Houri, Casey, Susan and Alex. Three of the four--Houri, Casey and Susan--preceded him in death. Masud had seven grandchildren Diana, Mark, Rawley, Peter and Lacey by his son Casey; and Annabel and Alexander Jr. by his son Alex. He also leaves a stepdaughter, Sharmin Bock and her two children, Fiona and Alastair, and a step-granddaughter, Christina Kew. All who knew Masud Mehran will be forever reminded of the example he gave to so many, and values that guided his life, which will keep his legacy alive forever. A service to celebrate Masud's life will be held on Friday, December 6, at 4:00pm at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, a donation in Masud's name can be made to the Persian Center at University of California, Berkeley, the Contra Costa Food Bank, Cornell University, or the Urban Land Institute Foundation."

2013-12-01T00:00:00Z,"MANSON--Florence Sando, A pioneering woman newscaster in radio and the early years of television journalism who hosted Pittsburgh's TV Show ""The Florence Manson Show,"" died on November 25, 2013 at her home in Riverdale, New York at age 95 from complications related to dementia. Florence was born in 1918 and she graduated from Westminster College in 1939 and received her Master's Degree in Drama from Case Western Reserve the following year. Florence broke out of the usual confines of gossip and fashion coverage that women broadcasters were relegated to, spending 18 years as a popular on air Pittsburghbased personality. In her era when women broadcasters were usually expected to keep their shows light and frothy, Florence Sando tackled the leading hard news of the day in a career that ran from 1941 to 1959. Longtime viewers of Pittsburgh TV stations with signals that broadcast up and down the East Coast and into the Midwest would remember her for ""The Florence Manson Show,"" which featured her as a host-interviewer, a pioneering use of that format. She interviewed well known public figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt (on radio) as well as celebrities on tv such as Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong. Some of these interviews are available at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York. She also produced the earlier hard news breakthrough ""Women's Angle"" a 15 minute morning broadcast. Sando's ""Women's Angle"" spoke to women as adults, presenting news of the world, rather than the low-brow mix of fashion and decorating tips dished out to female audiences until then. ""It was easy when the news was about Madame Chiang Kai-shek, or the ten bestdressed women, or Mrs. Roosevelt or Senator Margaret Chase Smith..."" Sando told author and educator and former broadcaster Lynn Boyd Hinds in ""Broadcasting the Local News- The Early Years of Pittsburgh's KDKA-TV."" She was so popular with the Pittsburgh area audience that KDKA-TV asked her in 1957 to host ""The Florence Manson Show,"" now using her married name after her wedding to film executive Arthur Manson. Her tv shows were always committed to public service as well as entertainment. She cooperated with government, civic, social and cultural agencies in support of the war effort during World War II and presented stories and interviews which contributed to Pittsburgh's post war development. The show had a successful run until Florence and Arthur moved to New York in 1959. Mrs. Manson remained active in theater and community affairs in New York City. She was a member of the Board of Ensemble Studio Theatre. She also served as a member of the Board of Riverdale Neighborhood House as well as serving as an Elder of the Riverdale Presbyterian Church. Florence is survived by her husband, Arthur, her daughter Cynthia Ann and son-in-law Jeffrey Faville, and their children James and Catherine and her son Anthony, her daughter-in-law Angela and their children, Daniel, William and Timothy. A memorial service will be held at the Riverdale Presbyterian Church on December 7th at 11:00am. Please send donations to The Riverdale Presbyterian Church at 4765 Henry Hudson Parkway West. Bronx, NY 10471."

2013-12-02T00:00:00Z,"PATIKY--Annabelle, passed away Saturday evening, November 30, 2013 in Greenwich, CT, at the age of 83. Miss Patiky was the daughter of Sam and Rose Patiky of Centerport (later Smithtown), Long Island, NY. Despite crippling cerebral palsy she led a life of accomplishment, due to her own perseverance as well as the farsightedness of her parents, who left no resource untapped in an age when most children with CP were given no opportunity for advancement and were institutionalized. Miss Patiky graduated Huntington High School, Hofstra University and the New York School of Social Work (now the Columbia School of Social Work), where she received her MSW. She worked as a social worker first at ICD Rehabilitation and Research Center and then at United Cerebral Palsy of NYC, where she also mentored other social workers. Miss Patiky's family were founding members of the Kings Park Jewish Center on Long Island, which she attended in her youth. Later on, she was an active member of the Brotherhood Synagogue in Manhattan, where she did volunteer work. She was an avid traveler and cruise-goer, as well as an accomplished watercolor artist whose works were exhibited in numerous venues. After living on her own in Manhattan for forty years, Annabelle moved to Stamford, CT, in 2005 to be near her niece. She is survived by her sister, Mrs. Leah Rubin, and Leah's children, Marion Copley, Elizabeth Rubin, Michael Rubin, Gabriel Rubin, and their families.

2013-12-02T00:00:00Z,"MEHRAN--Masud, passed away November 26th after a short illness at his home in Atherton, California-- surrounded, as he was during his life, by his family. Masud was born in Tehran February 6, 1920 and attended the American College in Tehran. At the age of 22 he married Maryam Ansari, and they immigrated to New York two years later. There, Masud attended Columbia University and Cornell University, from which he graduated with a degree in Agricultural Economics in 1946. Curious to explore their newly adopted country, Masud and Maryam traveled to each of the then 48 states, finally settling in the Montclair neighborhood of Oakland. Eager to contribute to the dynamic growth of post-war California, Masud founded the Sunset Development Company in 1951 and began building homes in the city of Livermore-- eventually developing SunsetTown, one of the largest and most successful residential real estate projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1978, Masud expanded Sunset's properties by purchasing a 585 acre portion of the Bishop Ranch in San Ramon. Over the next 35 years he transformed an orchard into a vibrant business community comprising more than 10 million square feet of world-class office space and facilities. Masud was active in a variety of industry and community organizations with far reaching benefits for the entire San Francisco Bay Region. These include The Urban Land Institute, Golden Gate University, Oakland's Children's Hospital, The Boy Scouts of America, and countless others. After his divorce from Maryam in 1978, Masud married Farideh Eshragi in 1987. The couple had homes in Atherton, San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, where they regularly entertained and enjoyed being with their family and friends. Masud had four children with his first wife, Houri, Casey, Susan and Alex. Three of the four--Houri, Casey and Susan--preceded him in death. Masud had seven grandchildren Diana, Mark, Rawley, Peter and Lacey by his son Casey; and Annabel and Alexander Jr. by his son Alex. He also leaves a stepdaughter, Sharmin Bock and her two children, Fiona and Alastair, and a step-granddaughter, Christina Kew. All who knew Masud Mehran will be forever reminded of the example he gave to so many, and values that guided his life, which will keep his legacy alive forever. A service to celebrate Masud's life will be held on Friday, December 6, at 4:00pm at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, a donation in Masud's name can be made to the Persian Center at University of California, Berkeley, the Contra Costa Food Bank, Cornell University, or the Urban Land Institute Foundation."

A member of the Art Dealers Association and a preeminent Surrealist Art dealer, he also championed early 1960s American avant-garde art. His renown stretched from Paris to The Menil Collection in Houston. Byron was among the last representatives of an old-world style of art dealing -one based not on commerce but aesthetics and generosity, taste and friendships. He was born on December 15, 1918, in Turkey, to Sophia Alatary and Antoine Patrikiades, both of Greek descent. He inherited American citizenship at birth from his father. After a youth spent in various European countries, he came to America and graduated from Harvard College in 1940. In World War II he served in the US Army in England and France. In 1965 he married Elizabeth Sverbeyeff Tarsaidze, a distinguished presence in architectural publishing from the 1960s to the present. His gift to the Archives of American Art of the meticulous records of the Byron Gallery reflects the clarity, care, and perceptiveness he gave all his projects. Friends may visit Frank E.

2013-12-03T00:00:00Z,"MEHRAN--Masud, passed away November 26th after a short illness at his home in Atherton, California-- surrounded, as he was during his life, by his family. Masud was born in Tehran February 6, 1920 and attended the American College in Tehran. At the age of 22 he married Maryam Ansari, and they immigrated to New York two years later. There, Masud attended Columbia University and Cornell University, from which he graduated with a degree in Agricultural Economics in 1946. Curious to explore their newly adopted country, Masud and Maryam traveled to each of the then 48 states, finally settling in the Montclair neighborhood of Oakland. Eager to contribute to the dynamic growth of post-war California, Masud founded the Sunset Development Company in 1951 and began building homes in the city of Livermore-- eventually developing SunsetTown, one of the largest and most successful residential real estate projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1978, Masud expanded Sunset's properties by purchasing a 585 acre portion of the Bishop Ranch in San Ramon. Over the next 35 years he transformed an orchard into a vibrant business community comprising more than 10 million square feet of world-class office space and facilities. Masud was active in a variety of industry and community organizations with far reaching benefits for the entire San Francisco Bay Region. These include The Urban Land Institute, Golden Gate University, Oakland's Children's Hospital, The Boy Scouts of America, and countless others. After his divorce from Maryam in 1978, Masud married Farideh Eshragi in 1987. The couple had homes in Atherton, San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, where they regularly entertained and enjoyed being with their family and friends. Masud had four children with his first wife, Houri, Casey, Susan and Alex. Three of the four--Houri, Casey and Susan--preceded him in death. Masud had seven grandchildren Diana, Mark, Rawley, Peter and Lacey by his son Casey; and Annabel and Alexander Jr. by his son Alex. He also leaves a stepdaughter, Sharmin Bock and her two children, Fiona and Alastair, and a step-granddaughter, Christina Kew. All who knew Masud Mehran will be forever reminded of the example he gave to so many, and values that guided his life, which will keep his legacy alive forever. A service to celebrate Masud's life will be held on Friday, December 6, at 4:00pm at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. In lieu of flowers, a donation in Masud's name can be made to the Persian Center at University of California, Berkeley, the Contra Costa Food Bank, Cornell University, or the Urban Land Institute Foundation."

Surviving are her husband of 59 years, George; three children, Gregory George Zilliac (Jennifer), Barbara Zilliac Graham (Neal), and Jocelyn Zilliac DeVault (Chip) and nine grandchildren (three each). Cynthia (Cindy) was born in New York City and grew up near Union City, PA. Cindy attended Allegheny College, Meadville, PA, as a Psychology major, where she met George in a psychological statistics class. She lived in Evanston, IL for the last 42 years. Growing up on what might be called a rural-nonfarm Cindy rode and cared for a horse named Chain. Our family loved to camp where she was sometimes referred to as ""Ranger Cindy"" by the kids for her organizing of the chaos of camping with family and dog. She also enjoyed private flying with her husband. One of her major interests was singing - she was trained as an operatic soprano in her youth, sang for years with the North Shore Choral Society, and sang in Aida at Chautauqua, NY. She made stained glass art, painted, and tutored urban disadvantaged youth in reading in a special program at Scott Foresman, after hours. Perhaps her most notable accomplishments lay in 20 or more years of lexicography in dictionary editing, at Scott Foresman. She was responsible for a lot that went into several first grade through High School Thorn- dike-Barnhart dictionaries, where she specialized in science definitions. She was also responsible for much of the dictionary art. Later she worked in the Social Studies department, working with authors on several middle-school social studies books on the histories of Florida and Texas. She was loved by all of us for her understanding and loving spirit. She is sorely missed. A celebration of her life is being planned. For more information contact zilliac@aol.com"

Jack was born on July 23, 1951, in Morristown, NJ to Mr. and Mrs. John H. Culbertson Sr. Jack attended The Peck Elementary School, and The Lawrenceville School in Princeton, NJ, class of 1970. Growing up, Jack attended the Camp Timanous in Raymond, ME, which shaped his lifelong passion for the outdoors. Jack graduated from The University of California, Berkeley, in 1974. He attended Emory University Medical School, graduating in 1978. Jack continued at Emory for his internship in general surgery from 1978-79, residency in general surgery at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI from 1981-81, and residency in plastic surgery at Emory from 1982-84. He joined Emory as a faculty member in 1986. In addition to his exceptional work with patients at Emory, he held a strong belief in the importance of education and training for the next generation of plastic and reconstructive surgeons. He put that belief into action as Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery services at Grady Memorial Hospital, mentoring hundreds of plastic and reconstructive surgery residents during his 27 years at Emory. He also served as Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Chief in the Department of Plastic Surgery at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown, and Section Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. For many years, Dr. Culbertson annually travelled with his students to Shiprock Northern Navajo Medical Center in New Mexico, and received the Navajo Area Indian Health Service Area Director's Award for Outstanding Health Care Provider in 1997. Jack was a teacher in all respects of life, sharing his knowledge and passion for the world with his friends and family. Jack was a curious and energetic man, demonstrated through his passions for flying, skiing, fly-fishing, ice hockey, carpentry, and mountaineering. He frequently spent time in the outdoors and logged hundreds of hours flying to Maine and Telluride. His sense of adventure was contagious to those closest to him, cultivating a wonder of the world and a desire to see and learn from all experiences. A celebration of the life of Jack Culbertson will be held on Saturday, December 7, 2013 at 3pm at Peachtree Presbyterian, 3434 Roswell Road NW, Atlanta, GA, 30305.

Jack is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Broaddus Culbertson, and his children, Kirby Steele Culbertson (25), John ""Jake"" Harrison Culbertson III (22), and Katharine Louise Culbertson (19); his mother, Grace Culbertson; and his sisters, Marian Burke, and Katharine Prentice. Jack was born on July 23, 1951, in Morristown, NJ to Mr. and Mrs. John H. Culbertson Sr. Jack attended The Peck Elementary School, and The Lawrenceville School in Princeton, NJ, class of 1970. Growing up, Jack attended the Camp Timanous in Raymond, ME, which shaped his lifelong passion for the outdoors. Jack graduated from The University of California, Berkeley, in 1974. He attended Emory University Medical School, graduating in 1978. Jack continued at Emory for his internship in general surgery from 1978-79, residency in general surgery at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI from 1981-81, and residency in plastic surgery at Emory from 1982-84. He joined Emory as a faculty member in 1986. In addition to his exceptional work with patients at Emory, he held a strong belief in the importance of education and training for the next generation of plastic and reconstructive surgeons. He put that belief into action as Director of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery services at Grady Memorial Hospital, mentoring hundreds of plastic and reconstructive surgery residents during his 27 years at Emory. He also served as Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Chief in the Department of Plastic Surgery at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown, and Section Chief of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. For many years, Dr. Culbertson annually travelled with his students to Shiprock Northern Navajo Medical Center in New Mexico, and received the Navajo Area Indian Health Service Area Director's Award for Outstanding Health Care Provider in 1997. Jack was a teacher in all respects of life, sharing his knowledge and passion for the world with his friends and family. Jack was a curious and energetic man, demonstrated through his passions for flying, skiing, fly-fishing, ice hockey, carpentry, and mountaineering. He frequently spent time in the outdoors and logged hundreds of hours flying to Maine and Telluride. His sense of adventure was contagious to those closest to him, cultivating a wonder of the world and a desire to see and learn from all experiences. A celebration of the life of Jack Culbertson will be held on Saturday, December 7, 2013 at 3pm at Peachtree Presbyterian, 3434 Roswell Road NW, Atlanta, GA, 30305.

He was 90. He was born in New York City on May 4th, 1923, the eldest son of Katharine Temple Emmet and Augustus Cass Canfield. He graduated from St. Bernard's and St. Mark's schools and attended the University of Chicago prior to enlisting in the Army in 1943, where he served in the Signal Corps in the Pacific until the end of World War II. After military service he followed his father's footsteps into the book business, initially taking a job as a salesman in the Doubleday bookstore in Grand Central Station. After holding publishing positions at McGraw Hill and Coward, McCann, he joined what was then Harper and Brothers in the mid-1950s. He rose quickly to head the high-growth trade paperback department in the 1960's, and occupied several other management roles, including vice president and publisher of the paperback, religious and medical divisions. He served on the company's board of directors from 1967 to 1987. In his long career he was known for publishing books of quality and lasting influence. With the help of his colleague Hugh Van Dusen, he initiated Colophon Books and reorganized and developed the Perennial line of paperbacks. He also created the Icon Editions imprint, a line of accessible academic art history titles in paperback. He was responsible for bringing a number of distinguished Latin American authors into English translation for the first time, including Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Julio Cortazar, Reinaldo Arenas, Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, Alvaro Mutis, and Ilan Stavans, as well as Nobel Prize winners Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa. Among the many authors he worked with were Peter F. Drucker, Craig Claiborne, Hugh Thomas, Enrique Krauze, Otto Friedrich, Paul Johnson, and art historians Robert Rosenbloom, Laurie Schneider Adams, Irving Sandler, and Bruce Cole. He adored his family, and considered his six children as his greatest life accomplishment. He plunged with joy into sailing, skiing and large dinners with his family at home, taking great pride in his roasts, risottos, and his famous boiled dinner with green sauce. He was proud of his Irish American heritage, taking his family to Ireland in 1998 for the 200th anniversary of the rebellion of the United Irishmen, in which his ancestor Thomas Addis Emmet (an Attorney General of New York State, and prominent lawyer in the Jeffersonian period) was a main participant. He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Abigail Angell Canfield, his sons Thomas, Temple, Lewis, Michael and Nicholas Canfield, daughter Susannah Canfield Hurd, granddaughters Juliana and Sophie Canfield and Ellory Hurd, grandsons Samuel Canfield and Ethan Hurd, daughter-in-law Danielle Parris, son-in-law Stephen Hurd, and dear step-sister Isabel Fuller Fox.

2013-12-08T00:00:00Z,"ZITRIN--Charlotte Marker, MD, died peacefully at home on December 3, 2013, at the age of 95. Dr. Zitrin was born in Brooklyn on September 30, 1918, before women had the right to vote. She was the daughter of the late Abraham Marker and Regina Adler Marker, and the older sister of the late Harold Marker. An exceptionally gifted musician and academic student, she became interested in psychiatry when she heard a lecture about Sigmund Freud in the Community Hall in Sea Gate, where she lived. With a small handful of women, she attended NYU Medical School (class of 1943), when she met and married Arthur Zitrin (NYU Med 1945), who survives her. Everyone in the class wanted her notes. The Doctors Zitrin moved with their children, Richard and Elizabeth, from Brooklyn to Great Neck, to take advantage of the excellent public education. Dr. Zitrin died in the home they purchased new in 1954. Supremely disciplined and organized, she started in practice as a pediatrician, and completed a second residency in psychiatry when both of her children were in Junior High School and could no longer come home for lunch. She was the founding Director of the Phobia Clinic at Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, and held that position until her retirement in her 70s. She was lead investigator in many peer-reviewed studies on phobias, conducting groundbreaking research on desensitization and talk therapies for usual phobias, and drug and talk therapies for agoraphobia and panic attacks. Charlotte was a generous philanthropist with wide-ranging interests including progressive politics, human rights, health, women's rights, the environment and the survival of Israel. Her husband said that if they could have, the whales she saved would have swum up to their door. She was a patron of the many arts of New York. Her Metropolitan Museum membership card says ""member since 1955."" She endowed scholarships for medical students at NYU and law students at Columbia, where her brother studied. In addition to her husband of 71 years, her children and daughter-in-law Victoria, she is survived by four grandchildren, Jesse (and his wife Ashley), Gabriel, Jacob and Maya, and a great-granddaughter Lauren Charlotte. There was a private burial. Donations in her memory may be made to the Charlotte Zitrin Scholarship Fund at NYU at: https://onlinegiving.nyumc.org"

Surviving are her husband of 59 years, George; three children, Gregory George Zilliac (Jennifer), Barbara Zilliac Graham (Neal), and Jocelyn Zilliac DeVault (Chip) and nine grandchildren (three each). Cynthia (Cindy) was born in New York City and grew up near Union City, PA. Cindy attended Allegheny College, Meadville, PA, as a Psychology major, where she met George in a psychological statistics class. She lived in Evanston, IL for the last 42 years. Growing up on what might be called a rural-nonfarm Cindy rode and cared for a horse named Chain. Our family loved to camp where she was sometimes referred to as ""Ranger Cindy"" by the kids for her organizing of the chaos of camping with family and dog. She also enjoyed private flying with her husband. One of her major interests was singing - she was trained as an operatic soprano in her youth, sang for years with the North Shore Choral Society, and sang in Aida at Chautauqua, NY. She made stained glass art, painted, and tutored urban disadvantaged youth in reading in a special program at Scott Foresman, after hours. Perhaps her most notable accomplishments lay in 20 or more years of lexicography in dictionary editing, at Scott Foresman. She was responsible for a lot that went into several first grade through High School Thorn- dike-Barnhart dictionaries, where she specialized in science definitions. She was also responsible for much of the dictionary art. Later she worked in the Social Studies department, working with authors on several middle-school social studies books on the histories of Florida and Texas. She was loved by all of us for her understanding and loving spirit. She is sorely missed. A celebration of her life is being planned. For more information contact zilliac@aol.com"

There will be a reception immediately following the services. Ellen was born on June 5, 1923, to Gottfried Walker and Frieda Bessire Walker in Buffalo, N.Y. She was raised in North Tonawanda, a suburb of Buffalo. In 1925 her parents, Swiss immigrants, founded Walker Brothers and Monroe, a watch and jewelry shop that remains in business today. The family was able to weather the difficulties of the Depression, sharing food with friends and neighbors and, most significantly for Ellen, ensuring her piano studies continued. World War II interrupted Ellen's music career when at age 21 she joined the Coast Guard as a WAVES radio operator stationed in St. Louis. After her honorable discharge in 1946 she attended the Zurich Music Conservatory to study piano. It was there that she met her future husband, Claude Vanden Broeck, and together they raised their four children in Haworth, N.J. During her time in Haworth Ellen was active in the local swim club, an avid tennis player, skier and bridge player and sang in local choirs in Haworth and Englewood. A gourmet cook, Ellen was also known for her legendary garden. An active member of the Swiss Society of New York, Ellen remained connected to her Swiss relatives by hosting them in her home in Haworth or visiting them in Switzerland. She spoke Swiss, her first language, her entire life. Music was Ellen's passion and sharing her love of piano with her children, friends and neighbors was her utmost delight. A music room with two grand pianos provided the perfect venue for concerts she hosted regularly. Opening her home to the community and inviting neighbors and fellow musicians to both enjoy and perform was her raison d'etre. After her marriage ended, Ellen moved to New York in 1980 ready to reinvent herself and embark on her career as student, musician and philanthropist. She earned her bachelor's degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1979 and her master's degree in creative writing from Brooklyn College in 1984. She continued her piano studies with the Leschetizky Association in New York, spent summers at the Adamant Music School in Vermont and continued to host home concerts at her Manhattan Apartment. Ellen's love of the arts and generous nature touched the lives of aspiring musicians and artists from graduate students to young children. She was instrumental in launching the New World Symphony in New York, sponsored students at the Mannes School of Music and was a major benefactor of the Third Street Music School Settlement in New York. Ellen was a fierce supporter of Native American art and culture and local modern artists, and served on the board of the New Museum. She was also an ardent supporter of Israel, Jewish causes and civil rights. In 1994, Ellen began to divide her time between New York and Boulder to be closer to family. She moved to Boulder permanently in 2004 and became involved with the CU College of Music's Adopt-a-Student program and was a major supporter of the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra. Ellen is survived by her four children, Leslie Vanden Broeck Dale and her husband Kenneth of Portland, Oregon, Barbara Vanden Broeck Fernie and her husband John of Lafayette, Claire Ellen Vanden Broeck of Lafayette, and Peter A. Vanden Broeck and his wife Sabrina of Shaker Heights, Ohio; and her grandchildren Sarah Dale of Washington D.C., Elliot Dale of Bozeman, Montana, Eliza and Luke Fernie of Denver, Paul and Andrew Vanden Broeck of Shaker Heights, and Lauren Vanden Broeck, attending The College of Wooster in Ohio. She was preceded in death by her brother Gottfried ""Fred"" Walker. Donations in Ellen's memory may be made to the Third Street Music School 235 East 11th Street New York, NY 10003"

2013-12-08T00:00:00Z,"NOBANDEGANI--Fariborz, The Iranian American community mourns the loss of its prodigal son Dr. Fariborz Nobandegani, known professionally as Fred Noban, who passed away at the untimely age of 49, on November 29th from complications following bone marrow and liver transplants. He was the youngest Director of Neurosurgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, and was touted as ""the Doctor's Doctor"" by many of his colleagues. Dr. Nobandegani was a diplomate of the American Board of Neurological Surgery as well as the American Board of Pain Medicine. He was a member of the prestigious Alpha Omega Alpha National Medical Honor Society and an Assistant Professor at NYU School of Medicine. Fariborz emigrated with his family from Iran in December of 1978, in the midst of the Islamic Revolution. He began his first day of classes as a 9th grader just 12 hours after his arrival in the United States. Working late into the night and often with a dictionary by his side, he quickly rose to the top and consistently graduated first in his class. He received his electrical engineering degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, only to realize that his passion lay in medicine. While working for Symbol Technologies as a researcher, he studied for his MCAT and was accepted to Down State Medical School where he also completed his residency training. He found his calling in neurosurgery while treating many police officers with gunshot wounds in the crime spree of 1980's Brooklyn. He went on to become a highly successful and respected neurosurgeon, practicing both at the Lenox Hill Hospital and the NYU Medical Center. He and his partners founded Neuroaxis in Manhattan in an upper eastside historical brownstone, which he meticulously restored and refitted to serve the needs of his patients. Neuroaxis became a pioneer approach in patient care from pain management to post-operative rehab, nutrition counseling, and holistic care. An avid sportsman who loved nature and ""beautiful America"", he often traveled to far away places to find the perfect fly-fishing spots. He loved his adopted country so deeply that he routinely dedicated his first Thanksgiving prayer to the ""blessings of this wonderful country."" His heartfelt speeches and unique humor would move everyone to tears, only to be followed by exploding laughter. His larger than life personality, his passion for life and huge smile was contagious. His love for his wife, Jennifer, and their two daughters, Alexa and Ava was unmatched. His dedication to his mom, for whom he planted a rose garden in the backyard of his Ridgefield, Connecticut home was unconditional. His relationship with his adoring sisters was magical. He had unwavering commitment to the state of Israel and Jewish charities. For five grueling months his loving brothers-in-law, nephews and close family and friends held daily prayers for him often behind his hospital door. A memorial was held on Friday, December 6th at the Academy of Medicine in NYC. Over seven hundred people were in attendance. Many were his former patients, whose lives he had saved. Contributions in his memory can be made to Save Our Kids foundation. Headed by the angelic Dr. Tom Walsh, the S.O.S Kids Foundation (SOSkidsfoundation.org) is a not-for-profit that finds treatments for resistant bacteria and helps patients with severely compromised immune system. Fariborz, your gentle voice and giant laughter will forever echo in our broken hearts. You lived for the truth and you fought bravely and with dignity till the very end. Your loving family: The Nobandegani, Brown, Adelipour, Zand, Moinian, Kermanshahchi, and Samuel families."

2013-12-08T00:00:00Z,"EDWARDS--Rev. Tom Turney, of Wilmington, NC, retired Episcopal minister, passed away peacefully on Saturday, November 30, 2013, after hospitalization due to a fall. He was the son of the late Eldorado Franklin Edwards and Sarah Elizabeth Turney. He is survived by his intrepid wife and companion of 69 loving years, Rosemary Cody (Romey). Tom was born in Winston-Salem, NC, graduated in 1942 from Sewanee, University of the South, and served as Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during WWII. Upon discharge from the Navy, he prepared for the ministry at the Episcopal Theological Seminary (ETS) in Cambridge, MA, while simultaneously pursuing studies in French history at Harvard University. He was ordained in 1948. After ministering to several small North Carolina parishes, he served as Canon at the American Cathedral in Paris from 1950-1951. That yearlong experience cemented his passion for French culture, his mastery of the language, spoken and written, and his delight in the novels of Georges Simenon. It also enabled him to complete original research on Jansenism in 17th century France. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1961 and a Master of Sacred Theology from ETS that same year. During an uninterrupted career in the ministry, he served five years as rector at St. Philip's Church in Durham, NC, 19 years at St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, and eleven years at Church of the Ascension in Clearwater, FL. In his sermons he used his scholarship, story-telling ability and sense of humor to illuminate the dilemmas facing Christians in the modern world. Church membership grew during his tenures; church building projects were funded; music, pageantry, and Christian education flourished. He also served on the boards of several civic organizations, including the Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1988, Tom and Romey returned joyfully to the American Cathedral for two more years before retiring to Wilmington. In addition to his full time parish work, Tom served for 53 years as a summer chaplain at St. Christopher's by the Sea in Winter Harbor, ME. There he captured the beauty of sea, rocks and pines in deft watercolors, and kept watch on wild birds. His many friends remember Tom as a bruising tennis player, a sympathetic listener, an enthusiast of puns and bon mots and as great company over the dinner table. His mind was broad and his view cosmopolitan throughout his long life. In addition to his wife, he leaves four children: Rosemary Sedgwick (Kevin Boyle) of Boxborough, MA, Lacy Bryce of Sioux City, IA, Tom T. Edwards Jr. of San Francisco, CA, and Claire Kearney (Theron) of Old Lyme, CT, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister-in-law, Sophia Cody of Winston-Salem, NC, six loving nieces and nephews and their families. Tom's life will be celebrated in a memorial service at 2:00pm on Friday, December 13, at St. James Church, 25 South Third Street, Wilmington. A reception will follow in the parish hall. All are welcome to attend. In lieu of flowers, Tom's family asks that donations be made to Friends of the American Cathedral, c/o Sherman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10022 or to Lower Cape Fear Hospice, 1406 Physicians Dr., Wilmington, NC 28401."

Dr. Zitrin was born in Brooklyn on September 30, 1918, before women had the right to vote. She was the daughter of the late Abraham Marker and Regina Adler Marker, and the older sister of the late Harold Marker. An exceptionally gifted musician and academic student, she became interested in psychiatry when she heard a lecture about Sigmund Freud in the Community Hall in Sea Gate, where she lived. With a small handful of women, she attended NYU Medical School (class of 1943), when she met and married Arthur Zitrin (NYU Med 1945), who survives her. Everyone in the class wanted her notes. The Doctors Zitrin moved with their children, Richard and Elizabeth, from Brooklyn to Great Neck, to take advantage of the excellent public education. Dr. Zitrin died in the home they purchased new in 1954. Supremely disciplined and organized, she started in practice as a pediatrician, and completed a second residency in psychiatry when both of her children were in Junior High School and could no longer come home for lunch. She was the founding Director of the Phobia Clinic at Long Island Jewish Hillside Medical Center, and held that position until her retirement in her 70s. She was lead investigator in many peer-reviewed studies on phobias, conducting groundbreaking research on desensitization and talk therapies for usual phobias, and drug and talk therapies for agoraphobia and panic attacks. Charlotte was a generous philanthropist with wide-ranging interests including progressive politics, human rights, health, women's rights, the environment and the survival of Israel. Her husband said that if they could have, the whales she saved would have swum up to their door. She was a patron of the many arts of New York. Her Metropolitan Museum membership card says ""member since 1955."" She endowed scholarships for medical students at NYU and law students at Columbia, where her brother studied.

2013-12-09T00:00:00Z,"DONNER--Aaron B.,respected attorney and political leader, died Friday, December 6, 2013 surrounded by his family in Bay Shore, New York. He was 88 years old. Aaron's life represents a great American success story. His father was a Russian immigrant who entered the US through Ellis Island. Aaron was born in 1925 and raised in Jamaica, Queens. He enlisted in the Army in World War II and fought in the Battle of Saipan. After the war, the GI Bill supported his undergraduate and Law degrees at NYU. He married Doris Schneider in 1951, and moved to Bay Shore, where he established a law practice specializing in real estate and became a leading legal figure on Long Island. He had a passion for politics, became active in the New York Democratic Party and Campaign Manager for Congressman Otis G. Pike, serving as his Congressional Aide from 1961-1978. He took pride in helping to create Congressional designation of the Fire Island National Seashore. He was chosen as Chief Counsel for the House Select Committee on Intelligence, and with Pike, led an historic investigation of the US Intelligence Community, leading to significant reforms of the CIA. In 1989 Aaron was appointed by then-Governor Mario Cuomo as Chair of SUNY Stony Brook Council. Aaron lived a full and accomplished life, pursuing his passions for family, recreation, and social activism with equal vigor. He adored sailing and fishing on the Great South Bay, and was never happier then when on the water in his boat. Aaron's Maine Lobster boat, the ""Hannah J."" was the source of great pride and enjoyment. He held an unflinching commitment to improving society and, together with Doris, engaged in numerous civil, social and political causes. Notable activism included work for the Development Disabilities Institute of Long Island, Planned Parenthood and Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. After the death of Doris, he retired and continued to divide his time between the Bay, supporting friends and local causes, and becoming an accomplished writer of short stories, based on his life experiences. In recent years Aaron lived with his dear companion, Molly Blue of Babylon with the kind support of Meg Green. Those who knew Aaron will speak of his extraordinary, noble values, his love of his family, his engagement with life and the world around him, his booming voice and mischievous sense of humor. He despised injustice and took every opportunity to challenge it, becoming a role model who influenced and shaped the lives of family and those around him. He leaves a proud legacy of achievement, integrity and love. Aaron is survived by his three children; Lauren, Jonathan and Ann, his grandchildren; Jesse, Becky, James, Julian, Olivia and Noah, and his daughter and sons-in-law; Louise, John and Kelley.

There, he excelled at track and field and became enchanted with ceramics, a passion which eventually led him to follow a career in art, specifically working in a glass medium. He began his career in San Francisco in the early 1990s. After graduating from San Francisco State University, he received an MFA from Ohio State University in 1998 and then moved to New York City in 2000. As a glass artist Kanik was both feared and revered for his skill and control of the medium. His work has been shown throughout the US and internationally. From his stylized vessel work to large installations and architectural designs, his work was versatile in both its use of the medium and the direction of its design. As head of the NYU glass department, Kanik taught students throughout the US, Europe, and the Middle East. Kanik was diagnosed with cancer in early 2012 and fought the disease valiantly with the help of friends, family, the Bellevue Hospital Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Kanik had originally asked for a memorial TV timeout during a Golden State Warriors game, but we decided to go with this obit instead. Sorry man!

2013-12-09T14:00:10Z,"The jewel-box-small, down-at-the-heels Minetta Lane Theater is the perfect setting for this opulently burlesque and deliciously Freudian retelling of “The Nutcracker,” which has shades of Cirque du Soleil, “Sleep No More” and “Fanny and Alexander” (with a dash of “Satyricon”). It’s the work of the Brooklyn-based, largely Juilliard-trained dance-and-acrobatics ensemble Company XIV. On a proscenium framed by heavy red curtains, with candelabra where the footlights would usually be, Tchaikovsky’s darling little Clara (a radiant Laura Careless) is a mini-Marie Antoinette with a comeuppance in store, to be delivered by Drosselmeyer, her godfather, played like a smarmy satyr pimp by Jeff Takacs. The genius of this production, which includes eye-dazzling physical feats performed on giant hula hoops and from silken swings, is its transformation of traditional ballet into louche vaudeville: the famous Spanish dance becomes a foot-stomping, castanet-clicking striptease; in the storied Kingdom of the Sweets, Clara wields a fat black whip to play gleeful dominatrix over a troupe of bare-bottomed, harnessed Licorice Boys."

Jack was an extraordinary man whose life story was truly inspirational. We were fortunate to count him as a member of our community for nearly forty years, first as a faculty member and then as a Rockefeller University Council member. Jack first joined Rockefeller in 1977, inspired by a strong belief in the power of investigative medicine. In 1980, he became head of Rockefeller's laboratory of biochemical endocrinology, where he studied the role of sex hormones in several diseases predominant in women, including various types of cancer. In the 1980s, he co-founded the Miami-based IVAX Corporation. Jack provided many long-lasting contributions to the scientific community, perhaps most notably the development of Naloxone, a drug that has saved countless lives in its 50-year history. In honor of this achievement, Jack received the John Scott Award, presented in recognition of an outstanding positive impact on the welfare of humankind. We will always remember Jack's unique blend of wisdom and generosity, as well as his profound sense of service. His philanthropic spirit led him to create two endowed professorships at The Rockefeller University: the Jack Fishman Professorship, currently held by Seth Darst, and the Joy and Jack Fishman Professorship, now held by David Allis. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife and partner, Joy. We also extend our sympathy to Jack's five children, his ten grandchildren, and his brother, Jerry.

2013-12-11T00:00:00Z,"MANLEY--John Kay, an architect employed in the office of Philip Johnson for 53 years, died December 8th, 2013. He was 88 years old. Born and raised in Brattleboro, VT, he enlisted in the army after graduating high school at age 17, spending two and a half years in uniform during World War II, including 15 months in France, Belgium, and Germany. Following the war, he moved to NYC where he received a B.A. in architecture from Pratt Institute in 1951; married dancer, actress, athlete, and practicing clinical psychologist Thea Trauner in 1953; and appeared in 17 amateur and semi-professional stage productions. In 1955, John was invited to work for Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson on the Seagram Building and its Four Seasons Restaurant. He subsequently decided to join Johnson's firm, where he became the principal designer. During his lengthy career, he worked for and with Johnson on some 178 built and unbuilt projects in this country and abroad. Among the buildings to which he contributed most significantly: New York State Theater at Lincoln Center; Kunsthaus (Art Museum), Bielefeld, Germany; Boston Public Library Addition; IDS Center in Minneapolis; Pennzoil and Transco, Houston; Thanksgiving Square Chapel and Park, as well as the unrealized Cathedral of Hope, Dallas; 1976 re-do of Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center; three iterations of Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth; Checkpoint Charlie I, Berlin; National Center for Performing Arts, Mumbai; Lancey Office Building, Geneva; the abandoned Lauder Oasis, Negev Desert, Israel; and the Visitor's Center on Philip Johnson's New Canaan, Connecticut estate. In 1991, Johnson listed him as co-architect of St. Basil's Chapel at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. Because of Johnson's declining health and infrequent office presence after the late 1990s, although none of these projects were ever publicly attributed to him, John perforce became the actual designer of the Domus Showroom at Madison and 34th Street, The Metropolitan Condo at 181 East 90th Street, The ""Urban Glass House"" at 330 Spring Street, and Number 5 Condo on East 44th Street all located in NYC; and the Sanctuary for Sufism Revised, Walnut Creek, California. Following a quadruple bypass in 1985, he suffered multiple, ongoing medical problems for the remainder of his life, which forced him to retire in 2008 at age 83. In spite of his many health issues, he remained an active, intelligent, and genuinely kind person who made a positive difference in the lives of everyone who knew him. He is survived by his daughter, Gail Faber, and two granddaughters, Lisa and Rachel, of Bridgewater, NJ; and by his partner of 44 years, Richard DeThuin, an author and reporter, of NYC."

She is survived by her children, Elizabeth (Chris) Quadracci Harned; Joel (Caran) Quadracci; Kathryn (Raja) Quadracci Flores; and Harry Richard (Emilio Cabrera) Quadracci; grandchildren Ellie, Kit, William and Alec Harned; Meghan, Halle and Danica Quadracci; and Isabella, Kaitlin and Harry Flores; brothers Jim (Pat) Ewens and Tom (Ellen) Ewens; sisters Jane (Dion Kempthorne) Ewens, Sue Ewens and Sister Mary Ewens; and many nephews and nieces. Betty was preceded in death by her husband and partner, Harry V. Quadracci, with whom she co-founded Quad/Graphics in 1971. With little money and big dreams, they launched Quad/Graphics in Pewaukee, WI., with 11 employees. The Quadraccis and their team persevered during the company's early, lean years to build a premier printing company. Today, Quad/Graphics is a leading global printer and media channel integrator with approximately 25,000 employees in eight countries. Betty was Quad/Graphics' matriarch and will long be revered for helping create the company's culture, which takes better care of employees' needs, including providing onsite childcare, which Betty first championed in the mid-80s; treating employees with dignity and respect; empowering employees to make decisions and innovate solutions; and providing employees with continuous training and education. A member of Quad/Graphics' board of directors since 2002, Betty played a pivotal role in the company's 2010 transition from a privately held company to a family controlled publicly traded company, which enabled Quad/Graphics to acquire its next largest competitor and further secure its leadership of the printing industry. For nearly 30 years, Betty was president and publisher of Milwaukee Magazine, acquired by Quad/Graphics in 1983.

2013-12-12T00:00:00Z,"MANLEY--John Kay, an architect employed in the office of Philip Johnson for 53 years, died December 8th, 2013. He was 88 years old. Born and raised in Brattleboro, VT, he enlisted in the army after graduating high school at age 17, spending two and a half years in uniform during World War II, including 15 months in France, Belgium, and Germany. Following the war, he moved to NYC where he received a B.A. in architecture from Pratt Institute in 1951; married dancer, actress, athlete, and practicing clinical psychologist Thea Trauner in 1953; and appeared in 17 amateur and semi-professional stage productions. In 1955, John was invited to work for Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson on the Seagram Building and its Four Seasons Restaurant. He subsequently decided to join Johnson's firm, where he became the principal designer. During his lengthy career, he worked for and with Johnson on some 178 built and unbuilt projects in this country and abroad. Among the buildings to which he contributed most significantly: New York State Theater at Lincoln Center; Kunsthaus (Art Museum), Bielefeld, Germany; Boston Public Library Addition; IDS Center in Minneapolis; Pennzoil and Transco, Houston; Thanksgiving Square Chapel and Park, as well as the unrealized Cathedral of Hope, Dallas; 1976 re-do of Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center; three iterations of Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth; Checkpoint Charlie I, Berlin; National Center for Performing Arts, Mumbai; Lancey Office Building, Geneva; the abandoned Lauder Oasis, Negev Desert, Israel; and the Visitor's Center on Philip Johnson's New Canaan, Connecticut estate. In 1991, Johnson listed him as co-architect of St. Basil's Chapel at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. Because of Johnson's declining health and infrequent office presence after the late 1990s, although none of these projects were ever publicly attributed to him, John perforce became the actual designer of the Domus Showroom at Madison and 34th Street, The Metropolitan Condo at 181 East 90th Street, The ""Urban Glass House"" at 330 Spring Street, and Number 5 Condo on East 44th Street all located in NYC; and the Sanctuary for Sufism Revised, Walnut Creek, California. Following a quadruple bypass in 1985, he suffered multiple, ongoing medical problems for the remainder of his life, which forced him to retire in 2008 at age 83. In spite of his many health issues, he remained an active, intelligent, and genuinely kind person who made a positive difference in the lives of everyone who knew him. He is survived by his daughter, Gail Faber, and two granddaughters, Lisa and Rachel, of Bridgewater, NJ; and by his partner of 44 years, Richard DeThuin, an author and reporter, of NYC."
2013-12-12T00:00:00Z,"KLIPPER--Sara Ida, beloved grandmother and concentration camp survivor died on Tuesday December 10th at 93. Until recently, she could be seen uptown sporting her furs unbound by the narrative of her heroic past. In her twenties she married and found refuge in the home of a Nazi resistance activist. She soon began trafficking weapons and playing an active role in the resistance movement. Her husband was discovered and killed and Ida became an inmate at Ravensbruk until liberation. Belgium later officially recognized her contribution: accolades she treated with a disparaging sense of humor. In her later life, Ida maintained her heroic spirit and became a most beloved mother-in-law, and adored grandmother. She lived with valor, an affinity for alternative medicine, convicted vegetarianism and a propensity for rhinestones. She will be sincerely missed."

She is survived by her children, Elizabeth (Chris) Quadracci Harned; Joel (Caran) Quadracci; Kathryn (Raja) Quadracci Flores; and Harry Richard (Emilio Cabrera) Quadracci; grandchildren Ellie, Kit, William and Alec Harned; Meghan, Halle and Danica Quadracci; and Isabella, Kaitlin and Harry Flores; brothers Jim (Pat) Ewens and Tom (Ellen) Ewens; sisters Jane (Dion Kempthorne) Ewens, Sue Ewens and Sister Mary Ewens; and many nephews and nieces. Betty was preceded in death by her husband and partner, Harry V. Quadracci, with whom she co-founded Quad/Graphics in 1971. With little money and big dreams, they launched Quad/Graphics in Pewaukee, WI., with 11 employees. The Quadraccis and their team persevered during the company's early, lean years to build a premier printing company. Today, Quad/Graphics is a leading global printer and media channel integrator with approximately 25,000 employees in eight countries. Betty was Quad/Graphics' matriarch and will long be revered for helping create the company's culture, which takes better care of employees' needs, including providing onsite childcare, which Betty first championed in the mid-80s; treating employees with dignity and respect; empowering employees to make decisions and innovate solutions; and providing employees with continuous training and education. A member of Quad/Graphics' board of directors since 2002, Betty played a pivotal role in the company's 2010 transition from a privately held company to a family controlled publicly traded company, which enabled Quad/Graphics to acquire its next largest competitor and further secure its leadership of the printing industry. For nearly 30 years, Betty was president and publisher of Milwaukee Magazine, acquired by Quad/Graphics in 1983. During her tenure, the magazine garnered hundreds of awards, including a Best Editorial Gold Medal for Betty's publisher's letter ""The First Amendment Starts Here."" Betty's creative inclinations led her to found Quad/Creative, a graphic design firm, in 1985. Betty served on the Milwaukee Art Museum's board for many years. In 1997 she and Harry spearheaded a $10 million matching donation from Quad/Graphics to kick off fundraising for a major museum addition. Designed by Santiago Calatrava and completed in 2001, the Quadracci Pavilion is a widely recognized symbol of Milwaukee. Betty also served on the boards of Artists Working in Education, a Milwaukee non-profit; the Greater Milwaukee Committee; and Milwaukee Women Inc., which she founded. Betty also led the Windhover Foundation, a philanthropic organization funded by the Quadracci family. Betty was one of the first Montessori teachers in the U.S. and helped establish the Waukesha (Wis.) Montessori School in 1964 and the Waukesha Head Start program in 1968, now the nation's oldest continually operating Head Start program.

A member of Quad/Graphics' board of directors since 2002, Betty played a pivotal role in the company's 2010 transition from a privately held company to a family controlled publicly traded company, which enabled Quad/Graphics to acquire its next largest competitor and further secure its leadership of the printing industry.

During her tenure, the magazine garnered hundreds of awards, including a Best Editorial Gold Medal for Betty's publisher's letter ""The First Amendment Starts Here.""

In 1997 she and Harry spearheaded a $10 million matching donation from Quad/Graphics to kick off fundraising for a major museum addition. Designed by Santiago Calatrava and completed in 2001, the Quadracci Pavilion is a widely recognized symbol of Milwaukee. Betty also served on the boards of Artists Working in Education, a Milwaukee non-profit; the Greater Milwaukee Committee; and Milwaukee Women Inc., which she founded. Betty also led the Windhover Foundation, a philanthropic organization funded by the Quadracci family. Betty was one of the first Montessori teachers in the U.S. and helped establish the Waukesha (WI) Montessori School in 1964 and the Waukesha Head Start program in 1968, now the nation's oldest continually operating Head Start program.

2013-12-15T00:00:00Z,"HAMBRICK--Dr. George W. Jr.,died at his home with his family by his side on Tuesday, December 10, 2013; six days after his 91st birthday. Dr. Hambrick, born on December 4, 1922 in Charlottesville, Virginia, was the son of a veterinarian and a nurse. He was preceded in death by his parents George Walter Hambrick, DVM and Anna McCallum Hambrick, and his sister, Anne Hambrick Uzmed. His mother's and father's families were descended from early settlers in Virginia. He believed himself to be one of the oldest survivors in his generation of the Coleman and Harris families of Virginia, both originally from England. His mother was also a descendant of those families although she herself was a member of the McCallum family of Scotland. Dr. Hambrick was a Virginian by birth and graduated from Concord College in Athens, West Virginia. He received his MD degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine and remained there for his first year of dermatological training. Following an internship at the University of Iowa Hospital, he trained in Dermatology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and Duke University in North Carolina. From 1948 to 1950 he served in the United States Army in Georgia and Okinawa, Japan. Beginning in the early 1950's George launched an academic career, equaled by few in his field, in which he rose through the ranks at Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins University, where he served as Professor and Chairman of Dermatology for nearly ten years, until 1976. He then directed the Department of Dermatology at the University of Cincinnati for five years before moving to Cornell University in New York, where he co-directed the Division of Dermatology for an additional 12 years, until 1993 and established Dermatology as full Department status. Dr. Hambrick was a Professor Emeritus at Cornell and Senior Lecturer at Columbia. His appointments have included editorial journal responsibilities as well as a variety of committees with the National Institute of Health. In 1987, together with Rockefeller University's Martin Carter, MD, PhD and Herzog Foundation President Peter Bentley, Dr. Hambrick founded the American Skin Association to represent the interest of skin disease victims and their families. At the age of 85, Dr. Hambrick would leave his home in Charlottesville, drive to Richmond, Virginia and fly to New York City. There he would stay Monday through Thursday to fulfill his duties as President of the American Skin Association. The American Skin Association remains a singular voice dedicated to overcoming the most serious forms of skin cancer and disease through research and education. In 1993, the Weill Cornell Medical College honored him by establishing the George W. Hambrick, Jr. Professorship in Dermatology. The Hambrick Professorship, is currently held by Dr. Richard Granstein, chairman of the Department of Dermatology at Weill Cornell. Most recently The George W. Hambrick Jr., a M.D. leadership fund in Oncological Dermatology was initiated by the Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology in recognition of Dr. Hambrick's great contributions to Johns Hopkins and to the field of Dermatology. This endowed professorship honored Dr. Hambrick's record of excellence in promoting healthy skin through skin cancer research and exemplary leadership in the field of Dermatology. Among his countless other accolades is the Dermatology Foundation's first Lifetime Career Educator Award for his service as a mentor, role model, and inspiration to students and residents. He served as president of both the Dermatology Foundation and the Society of Investigative Dermatology and, for 11 years, as a delegate to the American Medical Association. With more than 75 publications to his credit, he was an advisor to Skin & Allergy News and a member of the editorial board for the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. As an academic administrator, investigator, author and thoughtful leader, George influenced generations of dermatologists. Nothing, however, conveys his contributions as a formative teacher of young dermatologists more eloquently than the words of a former student. ""I wish to convey the compassion he exemplified to his patients while also imparting his wealth of knowledge to the residents. He worked tirelessly to stress excellence and to make sure we were performing to the best of our abilities."" In addition to Dr. Hambrick's professional credentials, his primary devotion was to his family and friends. Known affectionately as Dee Dee, his passion was nurturing relationships. As a visionary he took great pride in watching people grow, mentoring many throughout his long life. Dee Dee read constantly, his magnifying glass always in hand. He was an avid genealogist with an impressive memory for details, never forgetting a person or a name. Hours were spent researching his lineage, looking up Hambricks in phonebooks, leading to connections with newly found relatives, which became life-long kinships. History, opera, music, gardening, and travel were among his interests. He was also trained as a classical pianist. He has been called a gifted soul with a brilliant mind. What a wonderful life. He is survived by his niece, Anna ""Terry"" Bruce Columbus and her husband Marc and their children Jillian A. Columbus and Cole M. Columbus of Charlottesville, Virginia. The family would like to thank the caregivers of T&L Companions. We are grateful for the expert medical care from many University of Virginia Medical Center physicians including his primary care doctor, Dr. Diane Snustad. A special thank you goes out to his very dear friends, Howard and Abby Milstein of New York, recognizing them for their genuine support and steadfast commitment throughout their enduring friendship. A funeral service will be held at 11:00am, Thursday, December 19, 2013 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, VA with the Reverend Dr. Laura S. Sugg and the Reverend Dr. John G. McFayden of Philadelphia, PA officiating. Interment will follow at Monticello Memory Gardens. Visitation will be held 6:00pm to 8:00pm, Wednesday, December 18, 2013 at Hill and Wood Funeral Home.

He had a passion for politics, became active in the New York Democratic Party and Campaign Manager for Congressman Otis G. Pike, serving as his Congressional Aide from 1961-1978. He took pride in helping to create Congressional designation of the Fire Island National Seashore. He was chosen as Chief Counsel for the House Select Committee on Intelligence, and with Pike, led an historic investigation of the US Intelligence Community, leading to significant reforms of the CIA. In 1989 Aaron was appointed by then-Governor Mario Cuomo as Chair of SUNY Stony Brook Council. Aaron lived a full and accomplished life, pursuing his passions for family, recreation, and social activism with equal vigor. He adored sailing and fishing on the Great South Bay, and was never happier then when on the water in his boat. Aaron's Maine Lobster boat, the ""Hannah J."" was the source of great pride and enjoyment. He held an unflinching commitment to improving society and, together with Doris, engaged in numerous civil, social and political causes. Notable activism included work for the Development Disabilities Institute of Long Island, Planned Parenthood and Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. After the death of Doris, he retired and continued to divide his time between the Bay, supporting friends and local causes, and becoming an accomplished writer of short stories, based on his life experiences. In recent years Aaron lived with his dear companion, Molly Blue of Babylon with the kind support of Meg Green. Those who knew Aaron will speak of his extraordinary, noble values, his love of his family, his engagement with life and the world around him, his booming voice and mischievous sense of humor. He despised injustice and took every opportunity to challenge it, becoming a role model who influenced and shaped the lives of family and those around him. He leaves a proud legacy of achievement, integrity and love. Aaron is survived by his three children; Lauren, Jonathan and Ann, his grandchildren; Jesse, Becky, James, Julian, Olivia and Noah, and his daughter and sons-in-law; Louise, John and Kelley. The family requests in lieu of flowers that donations are sent to Calvary Hospital, Planned Parenthood and the Developmental Disabilities Institute of Long Island."

The Rube Goldberg contraption that is the cover of The Art of Rube Goldberg (Abrams Comic­Arts, $60), with a manually operated rising sun and clashing cymbals, is a pure delight, albeit foolishly excessive. It is a primitive way to animate the cartoonist Goldberg’s signature fantasy mechanisms that prompted the adjective “Rube Goldbergian,” which, according to Merriam-Webster, means “accomplishing by complex means what seemingly could be done simply.” Goldberg’s silly inventions, satires on the absurdity of our machine age, are just a portion of the wackily conceived, beautifully drawn cartoons, comics and games lovingly selected by his granddaughter Jennifer George. She also provides a preface that serves as a touching memoir: “My favorite thing to do with Papa Rube was make paper balloons. The first time my grandfather made one, I was mesmerized.”"

After a very successful academic and athletic career at Evergreen Park High School in Evergreen Park, IL, Bruce went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he developed his passion for energy development, drove the establishment of a varsity football team after a 70-year hiatus, and formed many treasured and lifelong friendships. After receiving degrees in economics and resource management, Bruce cofounded MITEX Corporation, a hydropower company later sold to Sithe Energies. As a Sithe Energies executive and eventual Sithe Global Power CEO, Bruce was responsible for the identification and development of dozens of power plants throughout the world. Power plant development eventually took him to Africa where he fell in love with the people and became committed to addressing many of the challenges preventing African nations from overcoming poverty. Whether building power plants to deliver reliable energy and much needed jobs (SITHE GLOBAL), laying fiber optic cable on the ocean floor to enable global connectivity and access (SEACOM), or helping nations realize the full value of their natural resources (GAPCO), Bruce envisioned real solutions and worked tirelessly to secure the required funding and manage the projects through to completion. Always a generous and giving man, Bruce formalized his philanthropy through many charitable organizations, including his own All for Africa, with school construction and education being his favored focus. He was fueled by the joy on student's faces when able to receive their education in a real school environment for the first time. Bruce is survived by his greatest assets -- his loving mother Virginia (Evergreen Park, IL), his once wife and now dear friend Marlo Marron, his beloved children, Dylan and Summer, his wonderful siblings Dawn (Bob Mason) of Beecher, IL, Walter (Susan) of Houston, TX, and Sandra (Robbie Robinson) of Redwood City, CA, his six handsome nephews, and a world full of cherished friends and respected colleagues.

She is survived by her children, Linda, Susan, Jill and Jim, their spouses, David, Cathy and Scott, her grandchildren and their spouses , Josh and Clare, Noah, Leah, Max and Jenna, and her sister, Harriet. The tender care and love she showed so many through her life was returned to her, especially in her last years. Blanche grew up in New York, first in Far Rockaway, and then on the Upper West Side. With her husband, Irving, she raised four children in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she made a tremendous impact on the community. She was instrumental in building the Fair Lawn Co-op Nursery School, helped start the Fair Lawn Mental Health Center and was a charter member of the Fair Housing Committee, bringing integration to the town. She worked side by side with her late husband, Irving, for twenty-five years at Zarchin Fabrics. When she retired from Zarchin Fabrics, she was the designated tour guide of New York for all her children, grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews, and all of their friends. As a member of Central Synagogue, her grace and dignity were recognized by everyone, and her smile on Friday nights lit up the Temple like the Sabbath candles. Friends and relatives whose lives she touched, and know her as Blanche, Aunt Blanche, Gram, or Mrs. Zarchin please join those of us who knew her as Mom as we share in a celebration of her life, at Central Synagogue, East 55th and Lexington at 9:00am on Tuesday December 17th.

2013-12-16T00:00:00Z,"ROSENTHAL--Dr. Alan, died peacefully on Friday, December 13, 2013, surrounded by loving family and friends. Dr. Rosenthal's passionate dedication to healing led to a remarkable career in neurosurgery, with a subspecialty in pediatric neurosurgery. After graduating from Yale University (1958) and the University of Virginia Medical School (1962), he pursued his fascination with the neurosciences to a residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and the Children's Medical Center of Boston, where he served as Chief Resident and Teaching Fellow in Neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School in 1968. His remarkable ability to perform intricate surgical procedures and his intense interest in pediatrics took him to Long Island, where, as a founding member of Long Island Neurosurgical Associates, he developed the first pediatric neurosurgical practice in the region. He then left LINA to become Co-Director of Winthrop-University Hospital's Institute for Neurosciences and Chief of their Division of Neurosurgery, where he was a principal player in the development of Winthrop's Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit--the first of its kind on Long Island. Dr. Rosenthal was also instrumental in bringing the first CyberKnife, used to perform non-invasive robotic radio-surgery, to the NY metropolitan area. Additionally, Dr. Rosenthal was an Attending Neurosurgeon at several other Long Island hospitals, including Long Island Jewish Medical Center, North Shore University Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Nassau County Medical Center and South Nassau Community Hospital. He was a contributing author to three major textbooks on pediatric neurosurgery, and his bibliography includes over 25 articles in peer reviewed journals. He has been an invited speaker at many international symposia. His greatest gift, however, found expression in the personal side of medicine. He remained in contact with many of his first patients, and followed their lives as they grew into adulthood. He continued to receive birthday and holiday greetings from several of them until he died. Dr. Rosenthal loved to play golf and tennis and to listen to baroque and classical music. He drove high performance sports cars and read volumes of history and international intrigue with equal relish. He delighted in a high-spirited conversation about history or politics. But his close family and friends remember him most often saying ""What can I do to help?"" Alan Rosenthal's memory survives as a blessing in the thousands of lives he touched and saved, but most especially in the hearts of his beloved and devoted wife Enid Feldman Rosenthal; daughters Amy Ilyse Rosenthal and Nina Michelle Rosenthal Fusillo; son-in-law Michael Fusillo; grandsons Nathaniel James and Benjamin Paul Fusillo; brothers-in-law Barry and Joel Feldman; and sisters-in-law Diane and Tina Feldman. Services will be held at Beth Israel Memorial Chapel in Boynton Beach, FL on Tuesday, December 17 at 1:45pm."

He was the recipient of a Bronze Star and was released with a rank of Major. He trained under the auspices of Dr. Ralph Colp and Dr. John Garlock at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, and proceeded to build a private surgical practice in Great Neck, New York that spanned more than 50 years. He was a founding surgeon of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York where he eventually became President of the Medical Staff. He was a Professor of Surgery at Cornell Medical School and also served on the surgical staff of Long Island Jewish Hospital.

During the 1967 Israeli War, he volunteered his surgical services for three months at Poria Hospital in Tiberias, Israel. He was an avid golfer and former President of North Shore Country Club in Glen Head, New York.

2013-12-16T00:00:00Z,"HAMBRICK--Dr. George W. Jr.,Died at his home with his family by his side on Tuesday, December 10, 2013; six days after his 91st birthday. Dr. Hambrick, born on December 4, 1922 in Charlottesville, Virginia, was the son of a veterinarian and a nurse. He was preceded in death by his parents George Walter Hambrick, DVM and Anna McCallum Hambrick, and his sister, Anne Hambrick Uzmed. His mother's and father's families were descended from early settlers in Virginia. Dr. Hambrick was a Virginian by birth and graduated from Concord College in Athens, West Virginia. He received his MD degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine and remained there for his first year of dermatological training. Following an internship at the University of Iowa Hospital, he trained in Dermatology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and Duke University in North Carolina. From 1948 to 1950 he served in the United States Army in Georgia and Okinawa, Japan. Beginning in the early 1950's George launched an academic career, equaled by few in his field, in which he rose through the ranks at Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins University, where he served as Professor and Chairman of Dermatology for nearly ten years, until 1976. He then directed the Department of Dermatology at the University of Cincinnati for five years before moving to Cornell University in New York, where he co-directed the Division of Dermatology for an additional 12 years, until 1993 and established Dermatology as full Department status. Dr. Hambrick was a Professor Emeritus at Cornell and Senior Lecturer at Columbia. In 1987, together with Rockefeller University's Martin Carter, MD, PhD and Herzog Foundation President Peter Bentley, Dr. Hambrick founded the American Skin Association to represent the interest of skin disease victims and their families. At the age of 85, Dr. Hambrick would leave his home in Charlottesville, drive to Richmond, Virginia and fly to New York City. There he would stay Monday through Thursday to fulfill his duties as President of the American Skin Association. The American Skin Association remains a singular voice dedicated to overcoming the most serious forms of skin cancer and disease through research and education. In 1993, the Weill Cornell Medical College honored him by establishing the George W. Hambrick, Jr. Professorship in Dermatology. Most recently The George W. Hambrick Jr., a MD leadership fund in Oncological Dermatology was initiated by the Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology in recognition of Dr. Hambrick's great contributions to Johns Hopkins and to the field of Dermatology. This endowed professorship honored Dr. Hambrick's record of excellence in promoting healthy skin through skin cancer research and exemplary leadership in the field of Dermatology. Among his countless other accolades is the Dermatology Foundation's first Lifetime Career Educator Award for his service as a mentor, role model, and inspiration to students and residents. He served as president of both the Dermatology Foundation and the Society of Investigative Dermatology and, for 11 years, as a delegate to the American Medical Association. With more than 75 publications to his credit, he was an advisor to Skin & Allergy News and a member of the editorial board for the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. As an academic administrator, investigator, author and thoughtful leader, George influenced generations of dermatologists. Nothing, however, conveys his contributions as a formative teacher of young dermatologists more eloquently than the words of a former student. ""I wish to convey the compassion he exemplified to his patients while also imparting his wealth of knowledge to the residents. He worked tirelessly to stress excellence and to make sure we were performing to the best of our abilities."" In addition to Dr. Hambrick's professional credentials, his primary devotion was to his family and friends. Known affectionately as Dee Dee, his passion was nurturing relationships. As a visionary he took great pride in watching people grow, mentoring many throughout his long life. Dee Dee read constantly, his magnifying glass always in hand. He was an avid genealogist with an impressive memory for details, never forgetting a person or a name. Hours were spent researching his lineage, looking up Hambricks in phonebooks, leading to connections with newly found relatives, which became life-long kinships. History, opera, music, gardening, and travel were among his interests. He was also trained as a classical pianist. He has been called a gifted soul with a brilliant mind. What a wonderful life. He is survived by his niece, Anna ""Terry"" Bruce Columbus and her husband Marc and their children Jillian A. Columbus and Cole M. Columbus of Charlottesville, Virginia. The family would like to thank the caregivers of T&L Companions. We are grateful for the expert medical care from many University of Virginia Medical Center physicians including his primary care doctor, Dr. Diane Snustad. A special thank you goes out to his very dear friends, Howard and Abby Milstein of New York, recognizing them for their genuine support and steadfast commitment throughout their enduring friendship. A funeral service will be held at 11:00am Thursday, December 19, 2013 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville, VA with the Reverend Dr. Laura S. Sugg and the Reverend Dr. John G. McFayden of Philadelphia, PA officiating. Interment will follow at Monticello Memory Gardens. In lieu of flowers, if one wishes, memorial contributions may be made to the American Skin Association, 6 East 43rd Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10017."

She was instrumental in building the Fair Lawn Co-op Nursery School, helped start the Fair Lawn Mental Health Center and was a charter member of the Fair Housing Committee, bringing integration to the town. She worked side by side with her late husband, Irving, for twenty-five years at Zarchin Fabrics. When she retired from Zarchin Fabrics, she was the designated tour guide of New York for all her children, grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews, and all of their friends. As a member of Central Synagogue, her grace and dignity were recognized by everyone, and her smile on Friday nights lit up the Temple like the Sabbath candles.

2013-12-17T00:00:00Z,"ROSENTHAL--Dr. Alan, died peacefully on Friday, December 13, 2013, surrounded by loving family and friends. Dr. Rosenthal's passionate dedication to healing led to a remarkable career in neurosurgery, with a subspecialty in pediatric neurosurgery. After graduating from Yale University (1958) and the University of Virginia Medical School (1962), he pursued his fascination with the neurosciences to a residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and the Children's Medical Center of Boston, where he served as Chief Resident and Teaching Fellow in Neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School in 1968. His remarkable ability to perform intricate surgical procedures and his intense interest in pediatrics took him to Long Island, where, as a founding member of Long Island Neurosurgical Associates, he developed the first pediatric neurosurgical practice in the region. He then left LINA to become Co-Director of Winthrop-University Hospital's Institute for Neurosciences and Chief of their Division of Neurosurgery, where he was a principal player in the development of Winthrop's Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit--the first of its kind on Long Island. Dr. Rosenthal was also instrumental in bringing the first CyberKnife, used to perform non-invasive robotic radio-surgery, to the NY metropolitan area. Additionally, Dr. Rosenthal was an Attending Neurosurgeon at several other Long Island hospitals, including Long Island Jewish Medical Center, North Shore University Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Nassau County Medical Center and South Nassau Community Hospital. He was a contributing author to three major textbooks on pediatric neurosurgery, and his bibliography includes over 25 articles in peer reviewed journals. He has been an invited speaker at many international symposia. His greatest gift, however, found expression in the personal side of medicine. He remained in contact with many of his first patients, and followed their lives as they grew into adulthood. He continued to receive birthday and holiday greetings from several of them until he died. Dr. Rosenthal loved to play golf and tennis and to listen to baroque and classical music. He drove high performance sports cars and read volumes of history and international intrigue with equal relish. He delighted in a high-spirited conversation about history or politics. But his close family and friends remember him most often saying ""What can I do to help?"" Alan Rosenthal's memory survives as a blessing in the thousands of lives he touched and saved, but most especially in the hearts of his beloved and devoted wife Enid Feldman Rosenthal; daughters Amy Ilyse Rosenthal and Nina Michelle Rosenthal Fusillo; son-in-law Michael Fusillo; grandsons Nathaniel James and Benjamin Paul Fusillo; brothers-in-law Barry and Joel Feldman; and sisters-in-law Diane and Tina Feldman. Services will be held at Beth Israel Memorial Chapel in Boynton Beach, FL on Tuesday, December 17 at 1:45pm."

2013-12-18T00:00:00Z,"HAMBRICK--Dr. George W. Jr. December 4, 1922 December 10, 2013. We honor the life of George W. Hambrick, Jr., MD, a man who devoted his life to helping other people. A giant in the field of medicine, he was the father of the modern field of dermatology. A superb clinician and prolific researcher, he was able to help millions of people through the doctors he trained and mentored, the medical breakthroughs he pioneered, and the philosophy by which he lived. He was a devoted public health advocate and spent much of the second half of his life using his medical knowledge to serve people at free clinics. In 1987, drawing on a loyal following of patients and his considerable administrative skills, Dr. Hambrick established American Skin Association (ASA), a lay organization for educating the public, building bridges with the dermatology community, and raising funds to support dermatology research. As Founder and the first President of ASA, he nurtured the development of a far reaching network which, along with its affiliates, has contributed tens of millions of dollars in recent years to fund the work of both young and established investigators while raising the level of public awareness about skin disorders. Retirement was not a part of his professional lexicon; through his ninth decade, Dr. Hambrick was still teaching, caring for patients, and playing an active and defining the role in ASA. Dr. Hambrick tirelessly devoted his professional life to the advancement of cutaneous medicine both at the bedside and as a scientific discipline. He served with great distinction as the Chair of three Departments of Dermatology: Johns Hopkins University, University of Cincinnati, and Cornell University. An enduring legacy of Dr. Hambrick's chairmanships was the evolution to full departmental status of the Divisions of Dermatology at Johns Hopkins and at Cornell. Dr. Hambrick was an influential leader in the profession, serving as Trustee and President of the Dermatology Foundation, as a member of the Board of Directors of both the Association of Professors of Dermatology and the American Academy of Dermatology, and member of the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association, representing the Society for Investigative Dermatology for many years. At the Society for Investigative Dermatology, Dr. Hambrick served in virtually all official capacities, including Vice President and President, as well as Secretary-Treasurer. He has held visiting lectureships and professorships at many institutions in the United States and around the world, and he is first or co-author of 75 publications. A graduate of Concord College (BS, magna cum laude, 1944) and the University of Virginia (MD, Alpha Omega Alpha, 1946), Dr. Hambrick pursued his dermatology residency training at the University of Virginia Hospitals and Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. He served in the United States Army Medical Corps stationed in Okinawa, Japan (1948-50). With the completion of a research fellowship at Duke University Medical Center, he taught at Duke, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the University of Pennsylvania. After positions a the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, with the encouragement of his former student and long-time colleague and friend, the late D. Martin Carter, he became Professor and Co-Head of the Division of Dermatology at the Cornell University Medical College in New York City and then Emeritus Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell. The George W. Hambrick, Jr. Professorship of Dermatology was established in 1993. The Chairman of the Weill Cornell Medical College Department of Dermatology occupies the George W. Hambrick Chair. Dr. Hambrick was an energetic and elegant gentleman. He was a proud son of Virginia who honored the traditions of his forbearers who first settled in the colony of Virginia in the early 17th century. He was devoted to the memory of Thomas Jefferson and although his medical career took him to many other places, George Hambrick remained throughout a leading citizen of Charlottesville. After 70 years of dedication to medical practice and education, Dr. Hambrick stands out as a champion of excellence in patient care, teaching, scholarship and advocacy for dermatology whose career perfectly reflects the highest ideals of the medical profession. Beyond a prodigious commitment to training generations of dermatologists and promoting scientific excellence in dermatology, he was always first and foremost a humane and compassionate physician. The entire Board and staff of American Skin Association and all those who had the good fortune to be touched by his genius and his generosity of spirit grieve for his loss. He will be sorely missed.

2013-12-22T00:00:00Z,"WATERS--Sheilah Ross, of Bedford, NY and Nantucket, MA died serenely at home in Bedford on Saturday, December 14. Swathed in her usual brightly-patterned pillowcases and gown, she simply and quietly stopped breathing. She was born April 25, 1928 in New York City. She graduated from The Brearley School in New York City in 1946 and Vassar College in 1950. Mrs. Waters was a successful fashion model from her late teens into her 30s, appearing on the covers of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She devoted herself to her two daughters' academic and cultural education and was very much a part of the New York City 1960s political scene. She was proud of her work as a docent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and of teaching art at New York City public schools. A trained artist, Sheilah presented art programs for the Mount Kisco Day Care Center and the Bedford Library. Sheilah found solace in historical novels and the New York Times crossword. She measured her medical recovery by her ability to finish increasingly difficult crosswords, and a day without the New York Times was not a day. Her tremendous loyalty to her old friends also carried her through. Sheilah took a festive approach to everything in her life: her home was adorned with pattern, color, brightness and humorous detail. One of the keys to her happiness is that she happily anticipated and then savored the small things: a rich dessert, a new book, the TV show MASH, a Porthault washcloth on sale, the bias cut of a dress, the opportunity to be silly. Her wide group of friends always looked forward to her lively and glamorous parties, where she was in her element. She was treated with charm and good manners by everyone she met as she went through her day. It is fitting she died shortly after a day of decorating the tree and wrapping presents. Christmas was her favorite time, because it is all about ornament, festivity and celebration of loyalty and love. All in all, she was what her first husband called, ""a classy dame"". She is survived by her husband, William Waters; her daughters Amanda Cross and Lisa Pownall-Gray (Dickon); her three granddaughters: Lindsay, Ella and Saskia; her brother Christopher Ross; her cousin Jane Frost; and her favorite niece and 'third daughter' Vickie Green. Her two husbands, Theodore Cross and Regis Gignoux, predeceased her. A memorial service will be held at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church on Saturday, January 11 at 11am (382 Cantitoe St, Bedford NY 10506). A celebration of her life will be held on Nantucket in the summer. Donations in Sheilah's memory may be made to the Bedford Free Library (32 Village Green, Bedford NY 10506), the Artists Association of Nantucket (Box 1104, Nantucket MA 02554) or to a charity of choice."

2013-12-22T00:00:00Z,"EIDENBERG--Eugene, who led distinguished careers in public service, academia, business, and philanthropy, died of glioblastoma on December 3, 2013 in Santa Monica, California. He was 74. Gene served as a trusted advisor to the President of the United States, played a pivotal role in remaking the American telecommunications industry, and made significant contributions to the cause of the democratic process around the world. Above all, he will be remembered for the great love he had for his family, who stood with him throughout his battle against brain cancer and were with him at his passing. Gene's wonderful qualities - his ability to analyze complex problems and issues, to recognize the value of relationships in resolving conflict and solving problems, his unerring kindness toward people of all stations, and his wonderful sense of humor played a key role in his success in life. Former President Jimmy Carter paid tribute: ""Gene was a delightful and cherished friend and a superbly competent and dedicated public servant."" Former Vice President Walter Mondale said: ""Gene was a wonderfully gifted and caring leader and friend who lived his life as an inspired public servant, educator and progressive thinker."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi: ""Gene's life was an example of outstanding public service to his country, creative and innovative management in American business, and a deep devotion to family and friends."" Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: ""Gene loved politics. He did not disparage the practice of politics; rather, he embraced political action as an avenue to represent the views of ordinary citizens and respond to their concerns, hopes and aspirations with tangible results."" Gene grew up in Mamaroneck, New York, where he was a high school All-American swimmer. He attended the University of Wisconsin and graduated with a B.A. in Political Science. After completing his Masters and Ph.D. in Political Science from Northwestern University, he taught political science at the University of Minnesota and was then appointed Vice President of Administration for the University of Minnesota system. Gene left his academic career in 1977 to join President Jimmy Carter's administration, first as Deputy Undersecretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare; then on the White House Staff as Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet and Deputy Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs; concluding his service as a member of the President's Senior White House Staff, reporting directly to the President. Following the Carter Administration, Gene became Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee, an extremely challenging job in the wake of the Democrats' loss of the Presidency in 1980. In 1982, William G. McGowan, founder and chairman of MCI Communications, convinced Gene to join MCI as Senior Vice President for Regulatory and Public Policy. During his career with MCI, Gene served as Senior Vice President for Strategic Planning and Corporate Development, President of MCI's Pacific Division in San Francisco, and Executive Vice President and Group Executive for MCI's International Business Operations. After MCI, Gene pursued a highly successful career in the worlds of high tech business and venture capital investment. He served as President and CEO of Macrovision Corp., was a Principal in the San Francisco-based venture capital firm of Hambrecht & Quist, and joined Granite Venture Associates LLC. Gene also served on the board and as chairman of Internap Network Services Corporation (NASDQ; INAP). In recent years, during his ""retirement"", Gene helped to support and inspire a group on the Hawaiian island of Kauai who were creating Kauai's first renewable energy company, and served until recently as a board member of Pacific Light and Power. Gene was especially passionate about the civil rights of individuals who wish to determine their future through voting. For more than twenty years Gene served on the board and as treasurer of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization working to support and strengthen democratic institutions worldwide. Through his work with NDI, Gene personally supported and participated in election observations and civil rights and democracy education programs in Asia, the Caribbean, South America and the Middle East. When Barack Obama ran for President in 2008, Gene and his wife Anna moved to Southern New Mexico to register voters and work on the campaign. Gene helped to recruit, organize, and train volunteer attorneys from across the country to staff the Democratic Party's Voter Protection Project which reduced incidents of voting rights violations in areas historically known for voter harassment. Gene's first marriage to Susan Zox produced two lovely daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. Later, he would marry Angenette Martin, who specialized in grassroots organizing and consulting for political campaigns and other social causes. When Angie was later diagnosed with breast cancer, Gene took a leave from work to be with her as she fought the disease that would eventually take her life. In 1999, Gene married former San Francisco news anchor and broadcast journalist Anna Chavez. Gene and Anna were married by his brother David, surrounded by family and friends in their backyard in San Francisco. Eugene Eidenberg is survived by his wife, Anna Chavez; his sister, Dorothea Ellern; his brother, David Eidenberg; his daughters, Danielle Eidenberg-Noppe and Elizabeth Cazenave; and their families Phil Eidenberg-Noppe, Naomi Ariel and Esther Dov Eidenberg Noppe; and Eric Cazenave, Nora Grace and Owen Eli Cazenave.

Ruth lived a rich and full life with her family and the many friends that she made throughout her entire life.

2013-12-23T00:00:00Z,"WATERS--Sheilah Ross, of Bedford, NY and Nantucket, MA died serenely at home in Bedford on Saturday, December 14. Swathed in her usual brightly-patterned pillowcases and gown, she simply and quietly stopped breathing. She was born April 25, 1928 in New York City. She graduated from The Brearley School in New York City in 1946 and Vassar College in 1950. Mrs. Waters was a successful fashion model from her late teens into her 30s, appearing on the covers of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She devoted herself to her two daughters' academic and cultural education and was very much a part of the New York City 1960s political scene. She was proud of her work as a docent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and of teaching art at New York City public schools. A trained artist, Sheilah presented art programs for the Mount Kisco Day Care Center and the Bedford Library. Sheilah found solace in historical novels and the New York Times crossword. She measured her medical recovery by her ability to finish increasingly difficult crosswords, and a day without the New York Times was not a day. Her tremendous loyalty to her old friends also carried her through. Sheilah took a festive approach to everything in her life: her home was adorned with pattern, color, brightness and humorous detail. One of the keys to her happiness is that she happily anticipated and then savored the small things: a rich dessert, a new book, the TV show MASH, a Porthault washcloth on sale, the bias cut of a dress, the opportunity to be silly. Her wide group of friends always looked forward to her lively and glamorous parties, where she was in her element. She was treated with charm and good manners by everyone she met as she went through her day. It is fitting she died shortly after a day of decorating the tree and wrapping presents. Christmas was her favorite time, because it is all about ornament, festivity and celebration of loyalty and love. All in all, she was what her first husband called, ""a classy dame"". She is survived by her husband, William Waters; her daughters Amanda Cross and Lisa Pownall-Gray (Dickon); her three granddaughters: Lindsay, Ella and Saskia; her brother Christopher Ross; her cousin Jane Frost; and her favorite niece and 'third daughter' Vickie Green. Her two husbands, Theodore Cross and Regis Gignoux, predeceased her. A memorial service will be held at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church on Saturday, January 11 at 11am (382 Cantitoe St, Bedford NY 10506). A celebration of her life will be held on Nantucket in the summer. Donations in Sheilah's memory may be made to the Bedford Free Library (32 Village Green, Bedford NY 10506), the Artists Association of Nantucket (Box 1104, Nantucket MA 02554) or to a charity of choice."
