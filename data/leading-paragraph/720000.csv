HUSTED of Westchester County the predestined Republican candidate for the Speakership of the Assembly, without a rival, just one year after he made a futile attempt to attain that office for the sixth time.

1890-01-04T00:00:00Z,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3. -- The anxiety which has been felt here for the safety of the steamer State of California was allayed this afternoon by the receipt of a telegram from First Officer Stevens, sent from Bowen's Landing, about seventy miles north of San Francisco, stating that the steamer had broken her shaft, but was otherwise uninjured and all on board were well."

1890-01-04T00:00:00Z,The complaints that have been made about the shabbiness of the official and unofficial treatment of the delegates to the International Marine Conference at Washington seem to be well founded.

The fact that the cruiser with triple-expansion engines managed to run 200 miles per day on 19 tons of coal, while operating at the same time the auxiliary engines, electric dynamos, and condensers is considered a most excellent showing. Still, steamboat men are not inclined to yield altogether their advocacy of the compound engine."

Perhaps it is on account of the beautiful appearance of the fruit, but more likely because of the wonderful profits that are supposed to lie hidden away at the roots of the orange trees."
1890-01-05T00:00:00Z,"A PLAY IS AN ANIMATED PICTURE. -- I remember that during the rehearsal of ""The School for Scandal"" I was impressed with the idea that the performance would not go well.

In 1888 we reported 2,180 locomotives built by 17 firms. In 1889 we find 1,860 built by 16 firms. The product of the firms not reporting would probably not raise the output to 2,000."

HUSTED, the predestined ruler of the Assembly for the coming session of the Legislature, has a bill all ready to introduce on the opening day which will afford a solution of the rapid-transit problem for this city is at least a significant recognition of the pressing need and the urgent demand for action on the subject."

1890-01-05T00:00:00Z,"The Duc de Broglie has met with a singular misadventure. It is well known that the former Ambassador of France at the Court of St. James's has occupied himself with historical studies since his political party has been out of power.

1890-01-06T00:00:00Z,"It will be better all around if the discussion of the new Rapid-Transit bill starts from facts rather than from conjectures. It is not true that Mr. CLEVELAND drew the bill. Neither is it Mr. HUSTED'S bill, and it may first be introduced in the Senate, of which Mr. HUSTED does not happen to be a member. It is misleading, therefore, to call it the Husted bill."

1890-01-12T00:00:00Z,"Whether or not our rising young men should be encouraged to enter political life depends very much upon what is meant by politics. It will hardly be denied that the term politician is not looked upon with veneration by our people, and that most men if called upon to class the individual who is labeled with that designation would not define him or describe his calling in terms of exaggerated praise."
1890-01-12T00:00:00Z,"BUENOS AYRES, Dec. 6. -- The premium on gold, the failures owing to the collapse in prices, the arrest and imprisonment of about a dozen money brokers, and the generally critical financial situation, form the chief topics of conversation. With regard to the imprisonment of the speculators or their agents, the feeling is rather one of sympathy with them, as they are looked upon by the business community as scapegoats sacrificed to appease popular clamor."
1890-01-12T00:00:00Z,"It is a rather risky venture for protectionists to cite the case of Germany in support of the prosperity attending a protective policy.

1890-01-12T00:00:00Z,"GARRICK AND DIBDIN. -- In 1768 Dibdin transferred his services to Drury-Lane, where he had the usual disagreements with Garrick in regard to money matters. One would hardly be justified in applying the term ""unscrupulous"" to Garrick; but he undoubtedly knew the value of money better than those who served him, and it was not his fault if he got the worst of a bargain."

In at least five of these factories the employes were receiving good wages and were contented; nor was there any anticipated trouble with the union."

1890-01-13T00:00:00Z,"The somewhat curious proposal of a Senator that Mr. WINDOM should suspend proceedings for the lease of the Pribylov Islands until he hears from Congress on the subject may be based in part on the changes which the Secretary has made in the terms of the lease. It is to run twenty years from July 1, 1890."
1890-01-13T00:00:00Z,"Last Saturday night was set apart by the architects for a reception to celebrate the close of their annual exhibition in the Fifth-Avenue Galleries. It is the fifth year of these exhibitions, which are always interesting and useful. Perhaps it may be permitted to make a suggestion, namely, that each year some specialty be taken up in order to give the exhibition point, and take from it the somewhat netrogeneous nature of the objects shown."

1890-01-13T00:00:00Z,"ALBANY, Jan. 12. -- Gov. Hill's professed change of front on ballot reform has deceived nobody here who is conversant with his methods.

This will give enough time to do the fighting."

1890-01-14T00:00:00Z,"It appears that the censure we directed on Sunday against the Park Commissioners for delaying to secure the operation of a horse railroad on the sunken road through the Park at Eighty-fifth-street should rather have been aimed at the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund. The Park Commissioners had a careful estimate made of the amount that would be needed to construct the road, ready for operation, and this estimate amounted to $20,000."

The Democratic representation is cut down from the customary allowance, a process for which there was no good reason. Senator CANTOR and Assemblyman SHEEHAN are quite justified in complaining of the treatment of the minority, and it is doubtful if in the long run anything is gained by such displays of party unfairness."

1890-01-14T00:00:00Z,"It is still curiously doubtful what is the real attitude of the Administration toward Secretary WINDOM'S silver plan. It has been submitted to the Cabinet and has been more or less discussed by the astute financiess who are notoriously prominent in that body. Whether it has been approved or not, and what will be the consequence if it has been approved, there is no means of knowing with certainty."
1890-01-14T00:00:00Z,"In the midst of Winter New-York was in Summer yesterday, so far as the weather was concerned. The people of this city yesterday morning were able to walk about with unbuttoned coats in a temperature of from 63 to 67, rendered June-like by a gentle southwest wind.

The number present was smaller than it has been in several weeks, and the racing was without particular incident.

These offerings were absorbed at the decline and the market recovered most of the loss, at the same time regaining to a large degree its tone.

1890-01-24T00:00:00Z,We seem to have reached the point where no one holding a representative position in political or official life any longer openly opposes ballot reform. Opposition takes the form of objections to certain details in the proposed plan of reform. Some of these are worthy of particular consideration. It has been objected to the Saxton bill that it does not provide for a general registration of voters throughout the State.
