He was one of the first young German businessmen who started working with the garment center in New York. He became the most successful women's wear manufacturer in Germany. He was a pioneer in building understanding between cultures and was admired and respected not only in the business community but in his personal life. In his later years he shifted his interest in the textile industry to the Eastern European countries and Russia and became a pioneer in building bridges internationally between these cultures and the rest of the world. At one time he was the biggest self-made industrialist devoted to women's wear in Europe. But he always made time for his soccer hobby, fine food and wine, the Club of Rome, and his friends.

He is survived by his wife of 29 years, actress Bonnie Franklin, his daughter Julie and her husband Glenn Mar, his son Jed and his wife Madoka, his two granddaughters, Natasha MarMinoff and Maya Grace Minoff, his brother Bruce and his wife Susan. He was the much-loved uncle of Melissa Minoff, artist Edward Minoff, and the godfather of Adam Bush. Born June 26, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York, Marvin attended Lincoln High School, Syracuse University and NYU before entering the U.S. Army, where he served in intelligence during the Korean War. Returning to New York, Minoff joined the William Morris Agency. In 15 years he rose quickly at two major agencies, William Morris and International Famous Artists (today's ICM), and became vice president of the motion picture department. He represented renowned actors, writers and directors such as Cicely Tyson, Sidney Lumet, David W. Rintels and Bruce Joel Rubin while packaging such blockbusters as ""The French Connection"" and ""Love Story."" His triumphs as an agent were always featured in Variety as ""Another success by Marvin Minoff, son of famed theatrical haberdasher Harry Minoff,"" a tip of the hat to his father, who owned a clothing store up the street. Minoff left the agency business in 1974 to become president of David Frost's David Paradine Television, Inc., where he co-produced with Frost the historic ""Nixon Interviews,"" as well as subsequent interviews with Henry Kissinger and the Shah of Iran. While at Paradine he also produced James Michener's ""Dynasty,"" ""The Ordeal of Patty Hearst,"" and ""Portrait of a Rebel: Margaret Sanger,"" starring his soon-to-be wife Bonnie Franklin. After leaving Paradine he continued as an independent producer until 1985, when he formed Farrell/Minoff Productions, a partnership with actor/writer Mike Farrell. The pair worked together for the next quarter century, producing motion pictures for television starring such luminaries as Shelley Fabares, Fred Savage, Helen Hunt, Tess Harper, Patricia Wettig, Jill Clayburgh, Missy Crider and Edward Asner, along with two features: the award-winning ""Dominick and Eugene"" starring Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta for Orion Pictures and Universal's ""Patch Adams,"" starring Robin Williams. A beloved and highly respected veteran of ""The show-biz wars,"" Minoff enjoyed the esteem of all those with whom he worked and was universally regarded as that rare thing in the business: an honest man. Services will be held Sunday at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills at 11am."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"ARMSTRONG--John Chace, died on November 4th, 2009 in Shelburne, VT from complications of aortic stenosis, a disease that robbed him of his energy and a bit of his memory, but never his analytic mind. He was delivered to the Lord peacefully, at his home, under the light of a full moon and a clear sky. John was born in 1918 in Rochester, NY, the only child of George S. and Dorothy M. Armstrong. Raised in Riverside, CT, he attended Riverside School, Brunswick School and Deerfield Academy. He graduated from Williams College and New York University. After a brief period of employment with Dupont, John went on to work with his father's firm, the George S. Armstrong Company, in New York City. He worked there as a consulting engineer until his retirement as president of the company in 1995. John married Helga Evensen in 1950 and, until her untimely death in 1974, raised their three daughters together. His unfailing and absolute devotion to his children and their wellbeing stirred his spirit until his last breath. He was married to Mary Helen Post Hurlimann from 1977 until 2001. While he held her three daughters, Mary Ann, Lily and Sandy, in the highest regard and with much affection, Sandy held a piece of his heart. Aside from the pride he took in his work and the accomplishments of his children and grandchildren, John was deeply proud of his efforts on behalf of the New York University Alumni Federation. He leaves his children: Karin and her husband, Arthur Newhouse of Stowe, Vermont; Christine of Shelburne, Vermont; and Lise of South Burlington, Vermont. Grandchildren, Bart and wife, Amy, Kirsten and husband, Ben, Matthew, Anna Christina, Brendan, Christian and Lille, and great grandsons, Chace and Liam, cherish his memory. Private services were held on November 7, 2009 at the Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, CT. A Memorial Service will be held next summer (2010) in Greensboro, VT, John's lifelong and beloved summer home. Although John appreciated flowers, and loved both a woman who grew them and a woman who painted them, instead of flowers, he preferred that any memorials in his name be made to the John C. Armstrong Scholarship Fund at the New York University Alumni Federation, c/o Alan Shapiro, Director of Gift Planning, 25 W. 4th Street, 4th fl., NYC, NY 10012. (212.998.6960)."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"BRODY--Martin, died at age 88 in West Orange, NJ on October 29, 2009. He was the Chairman and CEO of Restaurant Associates (RA) from 1963-1992. Under Martin's leadership RA became one of the premier restaurant companies in the country known for their concept restaurant and high quality food service for major institutional clients. Born in 1921 in a cold water flat in Newark, NJ, Martin started working in his father's business, Rain or Shine, at nine years old. Rain or Shine was a box lunch company that thrived during the Depression selling prepackaged lunches to factory workers throughout Essex County. He graduated from Weequahic High School and Michigan State University. He enlisted in the army during World War II. In 1946, he returned home a Captain and joined the family business. He met Florence Brody (formerly Gropper) on a blind date and they were married 6 months later. After the family business had grown from 1 to 60 trucks, Martin engineered its sale in 1961. Two years later, he became Chairman, President and CEO of RA by merging Waldorf Systems with RA. RA created and owned such renowned NYC restaurants as The Four Seasons, The Forum, Mama Leones, Tavern on the Green, Brasserie, La Fonda del Sol, and Sea Grill. The food service division included such institutions as Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center, United Nations, Metropolitan Museum, Harvard Club, Ford Foundation and the U.S. Open. Nationwide operations included Charlie Brown's and Acapulco restaurant chains, and Eastern News Stands. Born of immigrant parents, his mother was pregnant with Martin when they came to this country from Budapest. Martin literally went from Ellis Island to the boardroom. He was known among his peers and colleagues for his inspirational leadership and altruism. At an early age he was invited to join the Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and later World Presidents Organization. He served 10 years as the Chairman of the Executive Committee for Caldor, which was later purchased by Associated Dry Goods, a merger initiated by Mr. Brody. Other board positions included: Boston Celtics, Dollar Savings Bank, Leisure Technology, Jaclyn, Washington National Life Insurance Company and countless Smith Barney Mutual Funds. He also served on the American Stock Exchange Advisory Committee for eight years. Martin was a true humanitarian whose generosity and leadership in community affairs touched countless lives. His nonprofit and civic work included 14 years on the board of St. Barnabas Healthcare System, the largest healthcare system in the state of NJ. He served eight years as Chairman of St. Barnabas and in 1977 was awarded an honorary lifetime trusteeship. For 13 years he was Chairman of the Finance Committee for the NJ Transit Authority Board. A plaque at Penn Station in Newark commemorates his 20 years of outstanding service. In addition he served on the NJ State Board of Institutions and Agencies and was a Commissioner on the Governor's Management Review Commission. He served on the board of Temple B'Nai Abraham and the South Palm Beach Jewish Federation. He was Chairman of the Young Men's Division of the UJA and was actively involved in the Jewish Federation of Metro West NJ as both a volunteer and board member. Martin Brody did so much for so many. A man of honor, he had an extraordinary work ethic, integrity and personal warmth. In a world of change, no one who worked for him ever quit. A longtime resident of Short Hills, NJ, he lived in Boca Raton, FL. Mr. Brody is survived by his beloved wife and lifetime partner, Florence, brother Arthur, sister Marion, daughter and son-in-law Renee and Alan Levow, son and daughter-in-law Marc and Carleen Brody. His three grandchildren Jake Levow, Cary Levow and Justine Brody were the light of his life from the day they were born. He was fond of saying ""life is not a dress rehearsal"" and he lived his life with that quote in mind. Martin Brody devoted most of his life to serving his community, his country and his family. We are all better for having known him and he will be deeply missed."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"I took my 10-year-old niece and my 8-year-old nephew to see ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' and they were neither bored nor particularly excited by the film, though both professed to have really enjoyed it when queried afterward. They couldn't articulate it all that well, but they had certainly found a connection with the movie, possibly because, like many children, they basically live on that island all the time, in the company of adults who are variously playful, loving, angry, moody, absent, funny, sad and scary; and all these modes are totally unpredictable and frequently unexplainable. -- Caelum Vatnsdal of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in response to A.

Gaby was the beloved wife of legendary comedy writer, Coleman Jacoby, for over fifty-four years and magnificent stepmother to Catherine and Antoinette Jacoby. Nee, Marilyn Lagoria in Oakland California, Gaby became a flamenco dancer as a young girl, and came to New York City at age 19. Gaby danced on Broadway in ""By the Beautiful Sea"" in 1954 and in ""Mask and Gown"" in 1956. She went on to become a choreographer of live industrial musical shows, as a partner in production company Concepts Unlimited Inc. Concepts produced the documentary film, ""Norman Rockwell's World: An American Dream"" winning the Academy Award for Best Short Subject Film in 1971. In addition, Gaby produced and wrote many other successful documentary films for television garnering several Emmy awards and critical acclaim. Gaby had two passions: her love of her family and her love of her work. After forming Jacoby-Monet Productions with Coleman, Gaby began a new chapter in her ever developing career, writing and producing for HBO documentaries, including the highly successful ""Autopsy"" series with medical examiner Michael Baden. Working closely for the last several years with friend and colleague, Sheila Nevins, President of HBO Documentary Films, Gaby additionally produced ""The Iceman Interviews"" and ""The Iceman and the Psychiatrist"". Gaby was known and loved for her kindness, generosity, humility and strong, quiet convictions. In 1963 Gaby marched on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and was pleased to live to see Barack Obama elected President. Despite her illness, she continued working on the HBO documentary about the Barnes art collection, currently in production. Gaby is survived by her husband Coleman Jacoby, her stepdaughter Loria Parker and husband Gerry Janssen, brother, Jack Lagoria of San Francisco, niece Kitty Dorazi, grandniece Cynthia Dorazi and grandnephews. A memorial in her honor is planned at HBO on Tuesday, December 1st at 10am. Please RSVP at HBO, 212-512-7261 if planning to attend."

''So I thought to myself, I should open a bakery,'' he said, a smudge of flour on his face. ''Or at least a temporary one.'' And for three Sundays this month, he is doing just that -- baking birthday cakes, pear frangipani tarts and an assortment of macarons (he learned from the chief p√¢tissier at Ladur√©e, Philippe Andrieu) in the back of Partners & Spade. Everything is for sale (the macarons are $2.50 each; an apple caramel cake, $7) and intended for eating, rather than admiring. ''The real art is indulging in them,'' noted Mr. Cotton (above).

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"Every generation has the cross-country rivalry it deserves. The early 1960s had Packers-Colts, a battle of hard-hitting teams with clean-cut-but-fiery quarterbacks representing rugged shipping towns. The early 1990s had Cowboys-49ers, a booming new economy feud pitting petrodollar-fueled bluster against Silicon Valley efficiency. The current generation gets Patriots-Colts, an Internet-ready morality tale of contrasting personalities: Peyton Manning's aw-shucks drawl and the Colts' P.T.A. picnic reputation versus the tabloid pinup Tom Brady and the shadowy Svengali Bill Belichick. The baggage rarely overwhelms the game: the American Football Conference usually hangs in the balance when these teams meet, and the close final scores (18-15, 27-20, and 24-21 in recent years) do not do justice to how dramatic the games typically are."

Stylish women are wearing many points of view -- so long as it's black with a touch of white. The really daring are accessorizing with red handbags and shoes. And some women confide they have not been able to resist buying new clothes after a year and a half of resorting to their own closets. Last week started with Indian summer weather and ended with blustery winds and showers, bringing out two seasons of fashion.

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"OUTPOSTS A year ago, most people were open-minded about the ground-shaking changes that came with the economic collapse. Polls found a slim majority in favor of Wall Street bailouts to save the economy. They would listen, watch, wait. By this fall, the majority were not only against the bailouts, but in favor of curbing pay on Wall Street, and tightening government regulation of same. The continuous drip of perceived unfairness continues. One day it's news that Goldman Sachs seems to have stepped ahead of the line of those waiting to receive H1N1 vaccines: why were investment bankers getting doses rather than children or pregnant women? This week, Gallup found one in five parents saying they were unable to get swine flu vaccine for their children."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"KOZAK--Lillian, passed away peacefully in her home on November 11, 2009. An ardent leader in the fight for women's rights, as well as a professional accountant and auditor in the Nassau County Attorney's Office, Family Court Bureau from 1977-2002, Lillian was appointed Chair of The National Organization for Women-New York State Domestic Relations Task Force in 1975. Professional surveys show that the number one reason women contact NOW is for issues related to divorce. Lillian and the core of women she attracted to work with the NOW Task Force were fierce in their determination to end the impoverishment of women and their families once they went through the legal process of divorce. Her background as an accountant gave her the professional skills to monitor such technical issues as laws covering joint bank accounts, the hidden drawbacks in equitable division of property and poorly drafted divorce mediation agreements. Early on, she warned that alternate dispute resolution programs could put women at a disadvantage economically or in cases of child custody and support. Lillian advocated not only for making domestic violence an element in any court evaluation about the ""best interests of the child"" but also for ending practices that resulted in fraudulent statements about assets. Lillian was a recipient of the Susan B. Anthony award of The National Organization for Women-New York State, The National NOW Woman to Woman Award, the Long Island NOW Lifetime Achievement Award, and recently, The Award for Lifetime Service from the Coalition for Family Justice. Lillian was deeply loved by her family. Her generosity was without bounds. She is survived by her daughter Ellen Kozak and her son-in-law, Scott Miller of New York City. Her son Jeffrey Kozak is deceased. A memorial service will be announced."

He was 56 years old. Fred was one of the Nation's most noted and prolific scholars on matters of the law profession's ethics, focusing on diverse issues such as prosecutorial ethics, attorney-client confidentiality, ethics code drafting, judicial regulation of lawyers, and the role of advocates in the American legal system. He believed that lawyers have ethical roles beyond their duty to advance their clients' interests, that, in addition, they have countervailing obligations to the courts, the legal system, third parties, society as a whole, and general morality. Fred was a graduate of the Ethical Culture and Fieldston Schools, Johns Hopkins University and Yale Law School; before becoming a Law Professor at Cornell in 1983, he served as a public interest lawyer in Washington, DC. He moved to the University of San Diego in 1990. He was a member of the American Law Institute, a former chair of the AALS Section of Professional Responsibility and the Section on Scholarship, and has been an active member of various organizations relating to lawyers' professional ethics. His philanthropic work included support for the San Diego Shelter for Homeless Teenagers (SDYCA) and as a long-term advisor to the Legal Ethics Committee of the San Diego County Bar. Fred is survived by his loving wife, Sharon Soroko Zacharias, sons Blake and Eric, mother Laure, and brother Lawrence, brother-in-law Richard Soroko, sisters-in-law Cathy Schoen and Sherry Schoenberg, a nephew Josh and a niece Alix. He will be remembered above all as a warm, loving and humorous family man, a cherished colleague, a loyal and generous friend, and a man of the highest principles."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"EDISON--Sidney J.,died peacefully at home on October 29, at age 94. Known affectionately to his intimates as ""Palmer,"" he was a much loved and admired brother, cousin, mentor, friend, enjoyed for his whimsy, protean knowledge, ironic wit, modest authority and supportive generosity. Born in Atlanta, raised in St. Louis, a one-time resident of California and a sometime resident of Venice, Italy and Paris, he was at heart a New Yorker, and attended the theatre two or three nights a week, well into his later years. After attending the University of Wisconsin, Sidney spent a year painting in Paris. A man of high critical standards, no less when measuring his own talents, he returned to the US and settled in New York, where he was hired by Lincoln Kirstein as the first director of the MOMA Dance Archive, later to become the foundation for the Dance Collection at the New York Public Library. The 40s proved a personally eventful decade, in which he met and married the late Evelyn Brookman (the marriage ended but a friendship endured), studied painting and sculpture at the New York's Art Students' League, taught ballroom dancing at the Arthur Murray Dance Studios and extended his cultural interests in music and writing, counting among his early friends Virgil Thompson and Tennessee Williams. He moved to Los Angeles and focused on his writing skills. There he found work on films being produced to support the war effort. In 1972, through his mother's friendship with an early-grade school teacher in the UK, he encountered a child whose insatiable intellectual curiosity matched his own; he became a quiet benefactor of both the young man's cultural expansion and his continuing education, on through Oxford. Of Sidney, his protege, now a professor, has said, ""It's so terribly sad to lose someone who had been such an important, inspirational and transforming figure in one's life."" Sidney Edison was the son of Hannah Farbstein Edison and Harry Edison. His father founded Edison Brothers Stores, an enterprise in which he was joined by his four younger brothers. It began as a single shoe store in Atlanta and grew nationally to become the largest chain of women's shoe stores in the country. As the business grew, the family moved to St. Louis, home of the Company's corporate headquarters. Sidney was predeceased by his sister Edna. He is already missed and will be remembered and quoted often by multiple generations of his close and loving family, as well as friends and acquaintances, whom he treated with equal respect. At his request, no memorial service is planned."

2009-11-16T00:00:00Z,"What everyone has suspected for weeks has now been made more or less official by President Obama and other world leaders: no new legally binding climate treaty will emerge at discussions in Copenhagen next month. The continuing differences between industrialized and developing nations over who should bear the burden of stopping global warming mean that at best Copenhagen will be a steppingstone. This does not make the talks between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China any less important. Even an interim agreement will be impossible without enthusiastic participation by both countries, which together account for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, has sketched the outlines of a fallback position that would have all countries commit to achievable, transparent domestic targets while negotiations on a broader treaty continued. This is an honorable proposition that Mr. Obama can easily accept, but getting Mr. Hu to sign on -- and bring other developing countries with him -- may take some doing."

''Ultraviolet,'' her much-delayed first album, aims to be a constant stream of enlightened fun. This is a record girls can share with their parents, and possibly even their boyfriends.

Mr. Eckel was born October 22, 1951 in Houston, Texas. Mr. Eckel founded Copano Energy in 1992 and served as President and Chief Executive Officer until April 2003, when he became Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. Eckel's leadership, Copano grew from a single 23-mile pipeline to a successful midstream natural gas company with over 6,000 miles of pipeline and seven processing plants in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Louisiana. Mr. Eckel was also an industry innovator, as evidenced by the fact that Copano was the first midstream company to trade publicly as a limited liability company. Mr. Eckel conducted his life and his business affairs with the highest level of integrity. He had a tremendous work ethic and was a compassionate leader. His influence in the oil and gas sector is also reflected in his work at the Texas Pipeline Association, where he served on the Board and on the Executive Committee, and at Live Oak Reserves, Inc., an exploration and production company that he founded in 1986. Following graduation from Columbia University in 1973, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, Mr. Eckel joined the Securities Investment Department of The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York as an Investment Analyst and subsequently served as an Assistant Director of Investments (Energy and Minerals). In 1977, Mr. Eckel joined Lehman Brothers as an Associate in Corporate Finance and in 1978, was elected Assistant Vice President in Energy Finance. After leaving the finance sector, Mr. Eckel became involved in the energy industry, founding drilling, service and exploration and production companies before founding Copano. Mr. Eckel was known for his support of a broad range of charitable organizations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Elton John AIDS Foundation and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Physician Scientist Program Fund) and for fostering in others his ethic of purposeful giving. Mr. Eckel was a member of the Director's Counsel at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Eckel also served as a member of the Director's Circle and on the American Painting and Sculpture subcommittee for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Mr. Eckel is preceded in death by his mother Margaret Fultz Eckel, grandparents O.B. and Marguerite Fultz and John Glenn and Florence Eckel. Mr. Eckel's interest in oil and gas was fostered by both of his grandfathers' involvement in the oil and gas business in Texas. Mr. Eckel is survived by his father, John R. Eckel, Sr., his brother David Eckel and wife, Sandra, his sister Anne Lowery and husband Greg and his niece Sarah Lowery. Details of a memorial service are pending. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to make a donation in Mr. Eckel's honor should direct it to the Whitney Museum of American Art or the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (American Painting and Sculpture)."

He was delivered to the Lord peacefully, at his home, under the light of a full moon and a clear sky. John was born in 1918 in Rochester, NY, the only child of George S. and Dorothy M. Armstrong. Raised in Riverside, CT, he attended Riverside School, Brunswick School and Deerfield Academy. He graduated from Williams College and New York University. After a brief period of employment with Dupont, John went on to work with his father's firm, the George S. Armstrong Company, in New York City. He worked there as a consulting engineer until his retirement as president of the company in 1995. John married Helga Evensen in 1950 and, until her untimely death in 1974, raised their three daughters together. His unfailing and absolute devotion to his children and their wellbeing stirred his spirit until his last breath. He was married to Mary Helen Post Hurlimann from 1977 until 2001. While he held her three daughters, Mary Ann, Lily and Sandy, in the highest regard and with much affection, Sandy held a piece of his heart. Aside from the pride he took in his work and the accomplishments of his children and grandchildren, John was deeply proud of his efforts on behalf of the New York University Alumni Federation. He leaves his children: Karin and her husband, Arthur Newhouse of Stowe, Vermont; Christine of Shelburne, Vermont; and Lise of South Burlington, Vermont. Grandchildren, Bart and wife, Amy, Kirsten and husband, Ben, Matthew, Anna Christina, Brendan, Christian and Lille, and great grandsons, Chace and Liam, cherish his memory. Private services were held on November 7, 2009 at the Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, CT. A Memorial Service will be held next summer (2010) in Greensboro, VT, John's lifelong and beloved summer home. Although John appreciated flowers, and loved both a woman who grew them and a woman who painted them, instead of flowers, he preferred that any memorials in his name be made to the John C. Armstrong Scholarship Fund at the New York University Alumni Federation, c/o Alan Shapiro, Director of Gift Planning, 25 W. 4th Street, 4th fl., NYC, NY 10012. (212.998.6960)."

Mr. Eckel was born October 22, 1951 in Houston, Texas. Mr. Eckel founded Copano Energy in 1992 and served as President and Chief Executive Officer until April 2003, when he became Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. Eckel's leadership, Copano grew from a single 23-mile pipeline to a successful midstream natural gas company with over 6,000 miles of pipeline and seven processing plants in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Louisiana. Mr. Eckel was also an industry innovator, as evidenced by the fact that Copano was the first midstream company to trade publicly as a limited liability company. Mr. Eckel conducted his life and his business affairs with the highest level of integrity. He had a tremendous work ethic and was a compassionate leader. His influence in the oil and gas sector is also reflected in his work at the Texas Pipeline Association, where he served on the Board and on the Executive Committee, and at Live Oak Reserves, Inc., an exploration and production company that he founded in 1986. Following graduation from Columbia University in 1973, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, Mr. Eckel joined the Securities Investment Department of The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York as an Investment Analyst and subsequently served as an Assistant Director of Investments (Energy and Minerals). In 1977, Mr. Eckel joined Lehman Brothers as an Associate in Corporate Finance and in 1978, was elected Assistant Vice President in Energy Finance. After leaving the finance sector, Mr. Eckel became involved in the energy industry, founding drilling, service and exploration and production companies before founding Copano. Mr. Eckel was known for his support of a broad range of charitable organizations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Elton John AIDS Foundation and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Physician Scientist Program Fund) and for fostering in others his ethic of purposeful giving. Mr. Eckel was a member of the Director's Counsel at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Eckel also served as a member of the Director's Circle and on the American Painting and Sculpture subcommittee for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Mr. Eckel is preceded in death by his mother Margaret Fultz Eckel, grandparents O.B. and Marguerite Fultz and John Glenn and Florence Eckel. Mr. Eckel's interest in oil and gas was fostered by both of his grandfathers' involvement in the oil and gas business in Texas. Mr. Eckel is survived by his father, John R. Eckel, Sr., his brother David Eckel and wife, Sandra, his sister Anne Lowery and husband Greg and his niece Sarah Lowery. Details of a memorial service are pending. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to make a donation in Mr. Eckel's honor should direct it to the Whitney Museum of American Art or the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (American Painting and Sculpture)."

Their artistic involvement is bound to be minimal, given that the show is already in previews and had a critically acclaimed run Off Broadway last year. But the presence of three high-wattage celebrities at opening night, and the likelihood that they will promote the show through television appearances and media interviews, will raise the show's public profile at a time when theatergoers have plenty of Broadway musicals to choose from. Conceived by the Tony Award-winning choreographer Bill T. Jones, ''Fela!'' centers on the life and work of the Afro-beat superstar Fela Anikulapo Kuti. There are no big stars in the cast, which makes the involvement of Jay-Z and the Smiths even more of a marketing boon.

2009-11-18T18:59:12Z,"First, a correction. The concluding point in my earlier post is wrong: The House health care bill would not, in fact, effectively tax all 18 million of the remaining uninsured to pay for coverage for the other 36 million, because some percentage of that 18 million - in the draft of the Senate bill, it's anyone who couldn't find a health care plan costing less than 8 percent of income; in the House bill it's still unspecified - would be eligible for a ""hardship waiver"" exempting them from paying the fine if they can't afford coverage.

Tired yet? The bleary-eyed emerged the next day to make it to the Jeff Koons private reception and brunch at Gagosian before heading back to their hotels to get their glad rags on for MOCA's 30th anniversary gala. Over 1,000 guests - everyone from John Baldessari to Brangelina and Gore Vidal - turned out for the black-tie-soiree-as-performance-art, which raised over $4 million for the resurgent museum.

They served as heavy anchors to the slender suits of the day that have been resurfacing thanks to ""Mad Men"" and the spinoffs hitting the floors at Brooks Brothers, J. Crew and Banana Republic. Duckie Brown's brogue collaboration with Florsheim has reinvigorated its classic Royal Imperial collection with saturated colors and artful perforations; other stateside manufacturers like Alden and Allen Edmonds have classic versions of the shoe that originated in England with brands like Trickers, Church's and Grenson. I prefer the cordovan color for the rich tone it adds to any gray suit, but black will do just fine. Best of all, brogues are not just suited for business - they are the perfect exclamation point for jeans, whether they are faded and worn, or dark and unwashed.

In this first entry the mountaineer Peter Athans leads an expedition of climbers, archaeologists, anthropologists and art historians on a mission to rescue valuable Tibetan texts from their deteriorating shelter before looters find them. A confrontation results, involving a political group from a nearby village, the king of Mustang and even the rights of the divinities that are believed to inhabit the area. In ''Lost Cave Temples of the Himalaya,'' at 9, Liesel Clark chronicles the 2007 expedition of Mr. Athans, who is her husband, and the big-wall climber Renan Ozturk as they maneuvered into the crumbling caves, where each vertical move was a step into a lost world unoccupied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. 9:45 A.M.

2009-11-18T00:00:00Z,"Staying away from first-round picks like JaMarcus Russell and Darrius Heyward-Bey will be important to the Oakland Raiders' long-term success, but they could do themselves a favor in the short term by figuring out how to beat the Chiefs. Kansas City's 16-10 victory on Sunday was its seventh in a row at Oakland Coliseum. Since the Raiders played in the Super Bowl after the 2002 season, they are 3-11 against the Chiefs, a streak that includes losses to forgettable starting quarterbacks like Damon Huard and Tyler Thigpen. The streak is even more galling for Raiders fans when one considers that almost a quarter of Kansas City's 47 wins over the past seven seasons have come against Oakland. In the wake of the latest loss, Oakland Coach Tom Cable is contemplating a quarterback switch, but a change in buildings might be a better idea: the Raiders were much closer to .500 (12-14) against the Chiefs during the 13 years they called Los Angeles home.

2009-11-18T00:00:00Z,"REDLER--Angelika Marta (nee Hausman), of Manhattan, died Monday, November 16, 2009 just short of her 99th birthday. Familiarly known as Aga, she lived a storied life that began in privilege, was torn apart by extreme loss and suffering, and eventually ended in comfort and security. Her life story epitomizes the historic events that befell European Jews during the rise and fall of Nazism. Aga was born in Krakow, then part of Austria Hungary, now Poland, on November 28th 1910, into a well to do and cultured Jewish family. Her father and uncle were the owners of a multi city block shopping complex known as ""Passage Hausman"" in Lwow (Lemberg), Poland, now part of Ukraine. Highly educated, Aga studied art and literature; spoke French, Italian and English as well as Polish and German, which were her native tongues. She married Dr. Irvine Redler in 1934. At the start of the Second World War, Dr. Redler was able to leave the country because he played soccer for a team that represented Poland in an international league. Eventually, Mrs. Redler was also able to escape Poland and was reunited with her husband in Scotland, where both worked in a hospital as members of the Polish Army in exile under the leadership of General Anders. Mrs. Redler's parents and her brother Bruno were unable to leave and were exiled to Siberia by the Russians when the Nazis declared war on Soviet Russia. Mrs. Redler's father and brother, then 18, died in captivity as a result of malnutrition and lack of medical care. Her mother, Alicia Glatzer-Hausman survived the war and was reunited with her daughter and son-in-law in England. The three immigrated to the US in 1947 and made their home in New York City. Dr. Redler was professor of orthopedics at New York University Hospital until his death in 1981. Mrs. Redler worked as a volunteer translator at the hospital and at the Guggenheim Museum for many years. She loved New York, and its cultural events, especially the Opera. There are no immediate family members."

Renowned Rabbinic scholar, he immigrated to New York from Galicia passing through the gates of Ellis Island in 1920. His lengthy career had numerous stopping points and milestones, culminating with a span of 27 years in Montreal, Canada where, in addition to his pulpit position, he served for many years as President of the Board of Jewish Ministers. Following the death of his beloved wife Chiennie, he lived the last 31 years of his life in the community of Hillcrest, Queens. He is survived by his children Soshy and Chaim, their spouses Sol and Marni, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Zeidi was graced with an effusive personality and presence. He was a dynamic orator and legendary teller of tales. He was an integral force in our lives for so long, it is hard to conceive of life without him. Baruch Adoshem yom yom. Blessed be God for every day."

The point, Mary Jo Diehl said, was to give the young a chance to shine under pressure. ''In a dream world you've got six months and a bolt of Italian silk to make a dress,'' she said. ''In the real world your resources and deadlines are tighter than Shrek in a Speedo.'' Two of the judges, the models Elettra Wiedemann (top right) and Jenny Shimizu (near right), tried to keep open minds. Ms. Shimizu hoped she could spot talent at a glance.

2009-11-19T00:00:00Z,"Revised guidelines from an influential panel of medical experts suggest that women under age 50 forgo annual mammograms. Conservatives were quick to cite the new recommendations as an example of hazardous government intrusion into health care, and many readers agreed. Following are a sampling of comments: Here in a single capsule-sized dose is the reason health care costs are skyrocketing: No one is willing to accept anything short of the Cadillac standard of health care, even when a Ford is perfectly adequate to get you where you want to go. Donnolo Their agenda at the outset was one of cost-cutting, making more money for the insurance companies in the short term, and not patient care. They totally ignored a large body of evidence that contradicts their position. Marco77 It's all about cost first, quality second. In this health care debate, you get to pick your poison, but both pills are bitter. Bill My first mammogram, at the age of 40, showed I had ductal carcinoma in situ. Surgery followed. Five years later, I had invasive cancer, a far more aggressive and dangerous disease. It is unthinkable that mammograms should be withheld until the age of 50. It is also unforgivable that a remote task force could propose such a disturbing and alarming suggestion. cjm What about screening for prostate cancer? Oh, of course, men are better able to deal with the trauma of false positives. Fragile women must be shielded from this awful fate, even at the risk of their lives. Silly me. Robinson"

It will almost certainly lose the race after the season ends and Fox's ''American Idol'' returns to the air in January. Through 10 weeks, ''Sunday Night'' viewership (19.8 million), household rating (12.0) and all key demographic ratings placed it at No. 1. The numbers are slightly less dominating for the TV season, which began on Sept. 21 and excluded NBC's first three games.

2009-11-20T19:19:14Z,"It's late in the season, but you would not be able to tell by looking at the schedule. Top-ranked Florida is taking on Florida International, No. 2 Alabama plays Chattanooga and no top 25 teams play each other. It seems like a lineup fit for the first or second week. But even in this seeming desert of decent games, there are a few matchups worth watching. Two of them -- Oregon at Arizona and California at Stanford -- are in the wide-open Pac-10, which has defied expectations throughout the season. Mississippi State at Arkansas may not mean much in the larger context of the SEC, but it does give two programs which seem to be improving under relatively new coaches a chance to show where they stand. Kansas State's game against Nebraska does matter in the Big 12, though the prize for winning this game will be a date with powerful Texas in the conference title game. And to round things out and keep the A.C.C. fans interested, we'll be keeping an eye on North Carolina and Boston College. Our band of prognosticators have made their picks, and now it's time to hear from you. If you agree, disagree or merely find the predictions laughable, feel free to chime in with a comment."

When Mr. McCartney visited his home around the time of the Grammy Awards, Mr. Starr said, ""I played him this other track and Paul said: 'Give me the headphones. Give me a pair of cans.' And he went to the mike, and he just invented that part where he follows on my vocal. That was all Paul McCartney, and there could be nothing better."" The song was written by Van Dyke Parks and Mr. Starr, who added that Mr. McCartney's contribution ""makes the song like a conversation between us, and that was Paul's idea to do his part one beat behind me.""

2009-11-20T12:50:33Z,"The Department of City Planning has proposed regulations that would restrict certain homeowners from paving over their front yards to create parking spaces, a move that could alter the residential streetscape, especially in boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn.¬†Responding to residents' complaints of unsightly concrete driveways and lost street parking, the new rules would restrict so-called curb cuts -- the sidewalk indentations created to allow cars to move from the street onto the front yards of houses -- and tighten front-yard ""planting"" requirements. They would also require certain residential building owners to add parking if they modify their buildings.¬†These changes are ""key to fostering inviting, walkable blocks,"" the city planning commissioner, Amanda M. Burden, said when she announced the proposed new rules on Monday.¬†Like the PlaNYC and other recent Bloomberg administration initiatives, the rules hold the potential for making the city more pedestrian friendly and create more green spaces. But if approved, they would inhibit homeowners who want to carve out parking spaces on their own properties."

It was the fourth major disruption attributed to the communications system, which the Federal Aviation Administration began putting into service earlier in this decade as a way to cut costs and assure reliability. But the F.A.A. said late Thursday that it had not yet determined the cause of the failure, that the failure might not be related to the relative newness of the system, and that it did not see a pattern."

2009-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Tim Burton's career is the ultimate revenge of the art nerd. Mr. Burton, the self-professed alienated child of a dysfunctional family in Burbank, Calif., who funneled his loneliness, pain and grief into drawing cartoons, has found fame, fortune and a beautiful companion (Helena Bonham Carter) by telling cinematic tales of sensitive misfits triumphing over, or succumbing to, a world of repressive mediocrity. His recurring theme has near-universal resonance. Who has not dreamed of proving that he or she was underestimated by the forces of ignorance and venality? But it is Mr. Burton's extraordinarily inventive and adventurous way with the languages of popular film that accounts mainly for his success. Without the confectionery beauty and technical ingenuity of his movies -- and performances by charismatic actors like Paul Reubens, Michael Keaton and Johnny Depp in films as diverse as ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' ''Beetlejuice'' and ''Sweeney Todd'' -- his Oedipal pathos would not be enough."

2009-11-21T12:32:33Z,"Re ""The Archbishop's Blog"" (Nov. 8):The explanation for The Times's refusal to publish Archbishop Timothy Dolan's letter is lame and defensive, as is the rest of your column. Your argument seems to be that because The Times gave the archbishop a lot of coverage and said some nice things about him when he first came to New York that it can with impunity publish imbalanced and biased articles about the Catholic Church.Likewise, you seem to argue that because some of the religion writers for The Times sometimes write articles that are not considered offensive, this makes the offensive ones O.K. With respect to Maureen Dowd, it's difficult to see how The Times sponsors her vitriolic diatribes in general. Her work is short on reason and logic but long on venom and distortion, hardly a contribution to serious public discussion. It's no secret that The Times is steadily losing readership. Remaining in denial about its skewed coverage of the Catholic Church is just the latest example of how badly out of touch with reality the editors and writers for The Times continue to be. I suspect many will find your attempt to defend The Times's record on this matter to be thoroughly unpersuasive.MSGR. MICHAEL FITZGERALDÔÄ°Philadelphia, Nov. 8, 2009ÔÄ° ‚óèI write as a Catholic nun who is a daily reader of The Times, and I agree with your conclusion that The Times does not have a pattern of anti-Catholicism. Maureen Dowd's column on nuns and the Vatican was compatible with my ""anger and anguish about the moral crisis"" in the church. If any group in the U.S. Catholic Church should be investigated, it is the bishops who presided over the pattern of moving ""troubled"" priests from parish to parish without disclosure - to parishioners or legal authorities - of actions that potentially constituted sexual abuse and required investigation. In January 2006, The Times wrote an editorial praising a Detroit auxiliary bishop, Thomas Gumbleton, for his advocacy of improved public policies to deal with sexual abuse by priests and others. Subsequent to the publication of this editorial, local church leaders remarked that the supportive editorial was proof that The Times had an anti-Catholic bias. This reactionary critique causes me to infer that the accusation of anti-Catholic bias on the part of The Times is an example of the Catholic Church's being defensive and protective of itself, not an objective assessment of the attitude of the newspaper. SISTER SUE SATTLER, I.H.M.Detroit, Nov. 8, 2009ÔÄ° ‚óèThe New York Times has no sympathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and, in fact, is institutionally predisposed to find fault with the church wherever and whenever it may be found.The Times does not value churchgoing Roman Catholics as part of its constituency; as a result, we are fair game. The core audience of The Times -- secularists, atheists, members of certain politically left-leaning Christian and non-Christian denominations, all enjoy it immensely when The Times uses its pages to kick the church. Archbishop Dolan is correct -- other faiths (and, I might add, certain other favored segments of society) -- get a ""bye"" from the writers and editors of The Times. Who knows? Maybe the Times and its Catholic-baiting political and cultural allies will eventually hound us into shutting down our charities, closing our hospitals, ending our school system and walking away from our colleges. But life in New York and this nation would be much poorer for it.THOMAS J. RICE ÔÄ°Manhattan, Nov. 10, 2009 ‚óè I see nothing in Archbishop Dolan's screed that claims the facts of the reporting were wrong. He's just upset that the wrongs were reported. It is asked: ""What is fair to report and criticize about the leadership of a religion?"" Everything is fair to be reported - the good, the bad, and the ugly, as long as the reporting is accurate. Dolan says that Dowd dug ""deep into the nativist handbook to use every anti-Catholic caricature possible."" Virtually every Catholic in the country opposed the nativist anti-Catholic assault of the 19th century, but today's Catholics, on the other hand, support and praise the secular press coverage of the crimes and cover-up of the crimes of Catholic clergy - coverage that is almost totally absent in the Catholic press. Nothing is being reported today that the clergy has not brought on itself. For centuries the Catholic clergy has impressed on the laity the image of a clergy so superior that there slowly emerged the perception of a real ontological difference between the two. Accurate reporting in the secular press about sexual abuse, larcenous pastors stealing millions from their parishes, and now a Vatican investigation of our nuns is rightly tearing down this myth. B.ÔÄÆM. BYRNEVienna, Va., Nov. 9, 2009 ‚óè It is not surprising to me that the Catholic archbishop would see anti-Catholicism in the article by Maureen Dowd, coverage of the pedophilia scandal and other stories that didn't reflect well on Catholics or the Catholic Church. The church is and always has been an authoritarian hierarchy. As such, it is able to prohibit dissent or criticism from members of its hierarchy and, to a great degree, members of its congregations. It is reasonable for an archbishop to conclude that if he can't criticize, no one else should be allowed to either.In a secular, liberal democratic state, the cherished right of freedom of speech includes the right to criticize anybody and everybody. I hope these values persist for a long time to come. I have little hope that religions that depend on blind obedience will embrace them anytime soon.STEPHEN JONESVenice, Fla., Nov. 10, 2009 ‚óè I'm an 84-year-old Catholic who has been reading The Times since I was 17. I cannot agree with Archbishop Dolan's outrage over Maureen Dowd's column on the attitude of the church toward nuns. Women are just as intelligent and responsible as men. Many of them occupy the top positions in American business and serve in growing numbers in both houses of Congress as well as presidential cabinets. Indeed, one female recently almost achieved the office of president. What's next - ordained female priests?TERRY ROEWarminster, Pa., Nov. 9, 2009 ‚óè ‚óè Re ""Recession, Revolution and a Leaner Times"" (Nov. 1):Doubtless the decision about charging online readers is an important one, but seldom are important business decisions arrived at by following a clear consensus. More often, when one finds a clear business consensus, it is often proved wrong and/or late, like American auto companies' decision to play down smaller, fuel-efficient cars. No, this is a tough decision that will accurately be made by leadership choosing a path or paths that may appear questionable at the outset, but may be recognized as visionary later.GARY SWAYZEManchester, Mass., Nov. 1, 2009 ‚óèCome on, throw us a bone here - give those of us who care about The New York Times an opportunity to support it. How about a ""We Love the NYT"" coffee mug, an ""All the News That's Fit to Print"" umbrella, an ""Honorary Times Cub Reporter"" T-shirt, a ""Members Only"" spot on the Web site - you name it, we'll probably donate to get it.Like many Times supporters, my home page is The New York Times, and I read it (for free) every day. I send articles (for free) to friends and family by e-mail probably once a week. I get the Sunday Times delivered to my Toronto home but I can't justify getting the paper (or any newspaper) every day. But I rely on the kind of reporting that no one but The New York Times is doing, and I'd be willing, even thrilled, to support it in the same way I support Minnesota Public Radio, which I listen to (for free) online. Just give me a premium or two and a convenient way to send a hundred bucks or so to keep this kind of journalism alive while it finds a new economic basis for survival.GERSHON SILINSToronto, Nov. 2, 2009 ‚óè I am among those who hate seeing new organizations die by a thousand self-imposed cuts. At 39, I am on the younger end of the cohort that can't live without newspapers. But my wife and I have already dropped our subscription to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, our local daily, because it has so deconstructed itself that there's no point in paying for it.After the last price increase by The Times, I reluctantly gave up the print edition for Times Reader. It was a difficult decision and a hard adjustment; I'd still prefer to handle an actual newspaper, but it made no sense to pay over $800 per year when I can pay $15 per month for the same content. It seems to me that there ought to be something in between. I'd obviously be willing to pay far more than $15 per month.I continue to believe that in the long run, the best model for a news organization will be that of a nonprofit, public-service organization. There will always be a readership, an increasingly small and specialized niche for newspapers, but the old business model will not last. In my opinion, The Times should essentially junk its junky free site and develop more along the polished, clean subscription service represented by Times Reader.DAVID TALLMANAtlanta, Nov. 2, 2009 ‚óèLike other dedicated readers, I am worried. There is so much talk of newsroom cuts and elimination of bureaus and newspaper sections, I open the Sunday Times fearful that some section will be missing, or there will be some subtle change in the quality of the articles. Yesterday I was reminded that change and technological innovation will not necessarily lead to the demise of newspapers. I read The Times using the Times Reader for the first time and I was impressed by how easily I could work my way through in an efficient yet leisurely way - as a Sunday read ought to be. While nytimes.com is useful and a site I'll continue to use, it's very different from the experience of actually reading the (print-version) paper. I tend to jump about, depending on what grabs my attention, and I rarely get through the day's news. And I find pop-up ads irritating. But why is there no advertising in the Times Reader version of the paper? Wouldn't this be a perfect vehicle for print-style ads (NOT pop-ups!!)? The beauty of in-paper advertising is that it is seen, but if it is of no interest the reader can skip over and ignore it. It does not detract from the pleasure of reading the paper. Old-fashioned, perhaps, but effective. Surely there remain some advertisers out there who would see value in placing their messages here.CHERISSE BANDY Foster, R.I., Nov. 2, 2009 ‚óèThis morning, like every Sunday morning, I went out to the little coffee shop that charges $1 per cup for any size coffee, and picked up my New York Times. Five dollars for the paper is a lot of money for me at the moment - I am 69 years old, have been unemployed for almost a year, and things are very tight. However, not having the Sunday Times is like giving up a part of my history (I grew up in New York, and along with bagels and lox, The Times is Sunday morning), and giving up on the great tradition of print news. So, I pay my $5, buy cheaper food for the cat (just kidding) and enjoy the luxury of Sunday with the Times.Weekdays I mostly catch you online - and for the past few months I have been wondering why you do not charge at least a nominal fee for this service. I would be happy to pay it (I'll tell the cat to eat cake) if that fee would guarantee that the print version of The Times would stay with us. Our country needs real journalists - those guys that hold the governments feet to the fire and protect our interests. I hope you do go ahead with charging for online service, and I hope again to see reporters playing bridge and working crossword puzzles.SHARON RESNICKPrinceton, N.J., Nov. 1, 2009 ‚óèWhy don't you ask for voluntary contributions from online readers? I would be very glad to pay $300 per year. It is wonderful to read the paper here in Edmonton at the same time that someone in New York can. And many of your readers understand well how important investigative journalism is in keeping governments honest.BILL KELLY Edmonton, Alberta, Nov. 1, 2009 ‚óèI am a faithful reader of The New York Times online, but if it were not free, I would not have become so faithful. I used to go to many different sites to get all the news. Now I start at your site and believe it is by far the best in the United States. My recommendation is to allow a one-year free subscription to new users. Then try to keep the yearly charge as low as possible to encourage the widest readership. Like the woman in your column, I have my credit card ready. STEVE MARTIN Seattle, Nov. 1, 2009 ‚óèI encourage the debate on charging for The Times online, which The Wall Street Journal and The Economist are doing. But I have a problem if a subscription Web presence will still involve cookies and the related spying on my Web activity. I have debated this with people at The Times and The Economist.The Times suggests that the cookies make the Web ""easier to use."" But there is nothing in the cookies I found that improves my Web experience; many of them are tracking cookies that allow someone to build a marketable profile of me.The argument in your column is that millions of online advertising dollars are at stake if charging for access reduces the number of viewers. That may be, but the advertisers should be aware that many Web users, like myself, do not allow cookies and work diligently to avoid any tracking. And a growing number of Web users are learning about tracking and how to block the intrusion into personal privacy.The decision to charge or not is, in my view, a decision on the long-term survival of The Times. I am concerned that in time the loss of print revenue will force the online version to support more and more of the paper's operations. My larger concern is that the work of powerful newspapers - in keeping our governments and corporations in line with investigative reporting - will disappear without a decent revenue stream to pay the costs of such reporting. So I am willing to pay for access to a robust online New York Times, but I am not willing to surrender my privacy to get it.RAYMOND C. GRAYEaston, Pa., Nov. 1, 2009 ‚óè ‚óèRe ""About That Bloomberg Runaway"" (Nov. 15): Your column suggests the correct and inescapable point that polls can serve as self-fulfilling prophecies, discouraging those who would otherwise vote if the polls were more promising for their candidates. The important point left out, however, is that pollsters should ask directly regarding the intensity of support for candidates, rather than relying on whether respondents may ""change their minds."" That is a good question, but it is no substitute for also inquiring about how strongly poll respondents support specific candidates. If all polls asked about both the strength of support and the likelihood of voters' changing their minds, fewer large disparities between poll support and election support would occur.RICHARD E.

The parallels are eerie: Like Japan, Britain enjoyed more than a decade of booming growth, fed by aggressive bank lending and real estate investments.

(Starz) DOUBT (2008) Meryl Streep, above, plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Roman Catholic school in the Bronx who comes to believe that her supervisor, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest in one of their charges -- and may have acted on it -- in John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his stage play. Amy Adams is the younger nun who fuels her suspicions. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said, ''Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, 'Doubt' essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach.'' She added that Mr. Shanley's ''words are good, solid, at times touching'' but ''it's a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the Grand Concourse, was doing.'' Still, of the role that earned Ms. Streep yet another Oscar nomination, Ms. Dargis wrote, ''She's a hoot, but she's also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church.'' 10:30 A.M.

Renowned Rabbinic scholar, he immigrated to New York from Galicia passing through the gates of Ellis Island in 1920.

Following the death of his beloved wife Chiennie, he lived the last 31 years of his life in the community of Hillcrest, Queens. He is survived by his children Soshy and Chaim, their spouses Sol and Marni, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Zeidi was graced with an effusive personality and presence.

And it's not completely inappropriate. She was able to colonize cultural territory the way Alexander was able to colonize physical territory.''

The presidential primary candidates faced this same dilemma two years ago, when the Iowa caucuses were moved up to Jan. 3.

I would put out some guest towels and a collection of fancy soaps that were off-limits to blood relatives, and then -- voil√†! -- dinner was served. Preparing for a dinner party these days is far more complex, thanks to a vast and bewildering array of dietary needs that seem to have suddenly overtaken everyone I know. An unscientific survey of family and friends turns up one acquaintance who is kosher, two who are more like kosher-style, in addition to two vegans, a smattering of lacto-vegetarians and a couple who cannot digest gluten of any kind. Accommodations must be made for my mother-in-law, who is lactose intolerant, and a friend who is dangerously and inconveniently allergic to peanuts. I must know at least a dozen women who have declared lifelong war on complex carbohydrates. And then there's my daughter, a wispy and tender-hearted flower child who prefers not to eat ''anything with a face'' (although she will sometimes make random and completely unreasonable exceptions for hot dogs and pepperoni)."

The performance featured Lady Gaga, who played her song ''Speechless'' on a rotating pink Steinway grand piano, with butterflies painted by Damien Hirst, all the while flanked by Prada-clad dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet. Conceived for last weekend's 30th anniversary gala at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Mr. Vezzoli's work may have been brief, but that was his intention. ''My work offers a moment of magic that is hard to capture,'' he said. For fans of Mr. Vezzoli's celebrity-obsessed ephemera, he has two exhibitions -- one in Stockholm mixing Dal√≠'s work with his own imagery, starring Princess Caroline of Monaco as Queen Christina; the other, in Paris, an homage to Fellini, starring Eva Mendes as Anita Ekberg. Both run through the middle of January 2010. Fans of Ms. Gaga (above) are now able to buy the Frank Gehry-designed hat she wore that night at moca.org/mocanewauction.

Colorful and graphic, each design depicts a different member of the animal kingdom and reflects its nature, from the solitary owl against its night-sky background to an acid-green snake that seems to slither off the edge of its rug. A pair of butterflies and an adorable school of fish, above, round out the designs, which cost $3,285 or $4,725, depending on size.

And autumn's splendor appeared on the backs of a few imaginative women in a city known for dressing in black. Among the welcome minority was a woman in the surprise fall color, amethyst, left center; and Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue, near left top, in a refined mix of amethyst, aubergine and forest green. Louise Doktor, left center, was recently spotted in amethyst on Park Avenue at 7:40 a.m. An administrative assistant, she has a gift for color and pattern, choosing pieces with no regard for size and wearing them in an uninhibited way: a skirt as a cape; a huge plaid shirt as a shawl."

2009-11-22T00:00:00Z,"After 20 years, the dossier on Norv Turner is complete. He is a great teacher of quarterbacks and receivers whose offenses generate impressive statistics, if slightly less impressive point totals. He is a good planner but a poor in-game strategist. As a disciplinarian and motivator, he ranks somewhere between Dick Jauron and a substitute gym teacher. Turner's players must provide their own leadership, and every losing streak sparks questions about the team's character and commitment, as well as Turner's command fitness. The San Diego Chargers (6-3) invariably rally after each losing streak, because they have too much talent to do otherwise. That is why it was foolish to write them off when they started the season 2-3. The Chargers were not a bad team, they were just getting a jump on their disappointment."

A pair of butterflies and an adorable school of fish, above, round out the designs, which cost $3,285 or $4,725, depending on size.

He went on to Compton Advertising, now Satchi & Satchi, where he helped to launch Gleem Toothpaste ""for people who can't brush after every meal"". His next position was at William Esty. Once at Ted Bates Worldwide, Rags was instrumental in bringing William Esty into the Ted Bates Worldwide Organization. He is a past member of the new York Athletic Club, The Harvard Club of New York, and the American Advertising Federation. He was appreciated for giving full credit to those who worked with him for their contributions to advertising campaigns. He was also known for a wonderful sense of humor. His coworkers refer to the period of time that they worked with him as their ""Camelot"". He is survived by Mimi his loving wife for 57 years and dear daughter Martha, his niece Dana and nephews Richard and Norman. He was preceded in death by his brothers Lee, Norman and Orville. Rags will be deeply missed by all who knew him. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Please make remembrances to your favorite charity."

2009-11-22T00:00:00Z,"Researchers at Princeton University recently made a remarkable discovery about the brains of rats that exercise. Some of their neurons respond differently to stress than the neurons of slothful rats. Scientists have known for some time that exercise stimulates the creation of new brain cells (neurons) but not how, precisely, these neurons might be functionally different from other brain cells. In the experiment, preliminary results of which were presented last month at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago, scientists allowed one group of rats to run. Another set of rodents were not allowed to exercise. Then all of the rats swam in cold water, which they don't like to do. Afterward, the scientists examined the animals' brains. They found that the stress of the swimming activated neurons in all of the animals' brains. (The researchers could tell which neurons were activated because the cells expressed specific genes in response to the stress.) But the youngest brain cells in the running rats, the cells that the scientists assumed were created by running, were less likely to express the genes. They generally remained quiet. The ''cells born from running,'' the researchers concluded, appeared to have been ''specifically buffered from exposure to a stressful experience.'' The rats had created, through running, a brain that seemed biochemically, molecularly, calm. For years, both in popular imagination and in scientific circles, it has been a given that exercise enhances mood. But how exercise, a physiological activity, might directly affect mood and anxiety, psychological states, was unclear. Now, thanks in no small part to improved research techniques and a growing understanding of the biochemistry and the genetics of thought itself, scientists are beginning to tease out how exercise remodels the brain, making it more stress-resistant. In work undertaken at the University of Colorado, Boulder, for instance, scientists have examined the role of serotonin, a neurotransmitter often considered to be the ''happy'' brain chemical. That simplistic view of serotonin has been undermined by other researchers, and the University of Colorado work further dilutes the idea. In those experiments, rats taught to feel helpless and anxious (by being exposed to a laboratory stressor) showed increased serotonin activity in their brains. But rats that had run for several weeks before being stressed showed less serotonin activity and were less anxious and helpless despite the stress."

2009-11-23T09:27:13Z,"Now that water has been found on the moon, it seems even more fitting that 2009 has officially been designated the International Year of Astronomy (who knew?). But let's be honest: space's heyday was the summer of '69, when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong brought a rugged, clean-cut appeal to the final frontier. It was perhaps with this in mind that Simon Page, a self-taught graphic designer, created a series of posters for the Year of Astronomy that are modeled on textbook covers of the '60s and '70s. The result is a beautiful exercise in conceptual minimalism, with a clear geometric bent that betrays Page's math-nerd origins. (He has a degree in applied mathematics and took up graphic design as a hobby two years ago.) It's hard to choose which to like best, but I'm particularly fond of the deep blue poster, below, in which Page uses diagonal lines to create interstellar objects in relief - and calls to mind the gentle descent of a meteor shower."

Ms. Lewis, a former winner of ''X Factor,'' Simon Cowell's British music talent show, had last year's biggest-selling single in the United States in ''Bleeding Love,'' a full-throated cry of wounded resolve. The desire to repeat that success is natural, but an echo tends to be weaker than the original signal: more diffuse, less defined.

Now it is starting an auction process to bring in a market price for a handful of companies' warrants, including JPMorgan's. It's sensible, but the Treasury will probably still be criticized. The government typically took warrants over shares worth 15 percent of the amount of its injection when it invested in banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, received $25 billion from the taxpayer, and the warrants gave the government the right to buy $3.75 billion worth of stock. That right, lasting 10 years, has option value. Determining it, though, has been tricky."

The latter is particularly troublesome because in both the movie and the TV show, some of the main characters were nurses and extras could be found with any job description. The implication was that all this was borderline demeaning to a noble profession and perhaps even sexist. (Constructors are overwhelmingly male.

2009-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Carnage indeed. The new replacement cast of the Broadway hit play ‚ÄúGod of Carnage‚Äù was off to a slow start at the box office last week, the first performances without the all-star lineup led by James Gandolfini and Marcia Gay Harden, who won the Tony Award for best actress for the production (which itself won best play). This new incarnation of ‚ÄúCarnage‚Äù grossed $497,779 last week, compared with $1,107,302 the previous week. The audience attendance last week was only 63 percent of capacity. Still, last week‚Äôs gross was among the largest for a play on Broadway (and bigger than grosses for some musicals last week). But by comparison, the play‚Äôs former cast had helped catapult ‚ÄúCarnage‚Äù into the million-dollar club of top-grossing Broadway shows. The new cast ‚Äî Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott ‚Äî has not had the benefit of major new reviews, or anything like the rush of pre-opening media publicity that greeted the original cast. A spokesman for the production, Chris Boneau, said on Monday that the producers had expected the fall-off and noted that the new cast had higher grosses last week than the original ‚ÄúCarnage‚Äù cast had in its first full week of previews ($396,470) in March. He added that the producers had a ‚Äúvery healthy advance‚Äù in ticket sales and were ‚Äúmore than pleased.‚Äù."

One of the prosecutors, Karim Khan, said that despite what he called ''crocodile tears'' of contrition, the defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known as Duch, had ''sought to evade or minimize his role'' during nine months of hearings. Duch, 67, who is also charged with war crimes, murder and torture, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. His is the first trial in a United Nations-backed tribunal on the crimes of the Khmer Rouge.

2009-11-24T00:00:00Z,"President Dmitri A. Medvedev called Monday for tax incentives and other measures to assist Russia's beleaguered nonprofit groups, which have come under government pressure in recent years. Under his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, now the prime minister, the groups were subjected to new regulations, as well as increased scrutiny that they sometimes characterized as harassment. In addition, charities and nonprofit groups have not prospered in Russia because under communism, in which the government was to take care of society's needs, there was no tradition of private philanthropy. Mr. Medvedev, above, said new laws would not alleviate all the problems the groups faced but would certainly help. ''Our main goal is the support of the authority of nonprofit groups in society, and the attraction to this sector of more talented people and philanthropic resources,'' he said. ''We need to stimulate philanthropy and create a stimulus or a motivation for volunteers who toil for such organizations.''"

Confidential interviews with British officers returning from Iraq in the first year after the invasion were emblazoned across the front page of The Daily Telegraph on Monday. Partial transcripts of the interviews that appeared in the paper suggested that strains between the two allies, though known to some degree at the time, were more severe than previously acknowledged."

Some fault the homeowners who failed to heed the fine print; some say that the banks, pushing mortgages to unqualified, financially unstable borrowers, deserve the blame. A report published last week by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found that those who lived in predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods were more likely to obtain high-cost subprime loans. Nationally, more than eight million homes have been foreclosed on since the housing boom first gave way to widespread mortgage delinquencies in early 2007; in New York City, at least 15,000 properties have been foreclosed on this year, according to RealtyTrac, which collects foreclosure data.

When a choice results in success, we attribute brilliance. When it fails? That is another matter altogether."

(Mr. Jackman offered up a second vest instead of his trousers.) The clothing and other items, including autographed posters and programs, were sold to raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS."

2009-11-27T10:00:13Z,"""Green Lantern: Agent Orange,"" written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Philip Tan, is the top-ranking new hardcover on our list this week. It arrives at No. 2 and tells the story of Agent Orange, the latest light-based warrior to encounter Green Lantern. The story can be enjoyed on its own merits, but it also serves as a tie in to ""Blackest Night,"" the latest event mini-series from DC Comics, in which many of its long dead superheroes mysteriously (and unpleasantly) rise from the dead. Though some comic-book fans say they are coming down with ""event fatigue,"" that eight-issue mini-series, also written by Mr. Johns, is proving popular. The first issue, which went on sale in July, sold over 175,000 copies. It's also proving to be the gift the keeps giving: other titles connected to the storyline have also received a boost in sales."

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Sized for coffee tables but more serious than the average book in that category, BURTYNSKY: OIL, the companion to a current show at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington (through Dec. 13), chronicles the Canadian photographer's decade-long look at the fuel industry. Moving from Alberta oil fields to the Talladega Speedway to the ship-breaking yards of Bangladesh, Edward Burtynsky works on a global scale without preaching, and with an eye to sublime landscape paintings. His prints reveal epic waste and irreversible degradation, but carry a whiff of fantasy; the essayist Paul Roth refers to the world therein as ''Petrolia.'' Also worth reading is the down-to-earth travelogue by the Toronto writer Michael Mitchell, who accompanied Mr. Burtynsky to auto shows, tire dumps and bike rallies. (Steidl/Corcoran, $125.)"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"There's a good reason why the three daily book critics for The New York Times don't make 10-best lists at the end of the year: we can't. None of us has read everything. Our reviewing assignments don't overlap. None of us has an objective overview of the year's best and most important books, but this is what we do have: favorites. They are books we have not only admired in the abstract but also enjoyed, recommended and given to friends. The selections on our 10-book lists winnow down a wide array of possibilities. Of the tens of thousands of books published each year, the daily Times reviews only about 250. Each of us chose his or her share of those titles for review. Now Michiko Kakutani, Dwight Garner and I further narrow down those choices, and each of us can tell you which 10 books we'll remember best."

The good news is that the industry's push to Blu-ray has occasioned some substantial upgrades of evergreen titles, and with the price of Blu-ray players dropping further into the comfort zone, many film lovers may decide that this is the year to make the transition. Below are some of the most notable releases of the last few months. Prices given are the manufacturers' suggested retail, which can often be cut in half with a little shopping around."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"TITO RODR√≠GUEZ EL INOLVIDABLE: A MAN AND HIS MUSIC The recently revived Fania Records has started reaching outside itself, giving new life to the catalogs of artists it never recorded. Here's Tito Rodr√≠guez, a singer and bandleader who lighted up Afro-Latin music from the mid-'40s to the mid-'60s. (At which point he finally lost his drawn-out battle for mambo dominance to Tito Puente, then relocated to his native Puerto Rico and died in 1973.) This exemplary set -- taken from long-out-of-print records made during the '60s -- includes luxe big-band tracks and smaller, more intense conjunto jam sessions, as well as live recordings from the Palladium, the locus of New York's mambo mania. There's also a fascinating 1960 cut called ''Esta Es Mi Orquesta'' -- possibly modeled after an earlier Stan Kenton piece called ''Prologue'' -- in which Rodr√≠guez delivers a spoken lecture in mambo dynamics, introducing musicians one by one, letting them take their licks. (Fania, two discs, $18.98.) BEN RATLIFF"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"JOHN WESLEY. One of the most talked about exhibitions that happened in conjunction with this year's Venice Biennale was an extensive survey of the five-decade career of the painter John Wesley at the Fondazione Prada. The mammoth, 557-page catalog for that show is a visual and informational delight. It includes a profusely illustrated essay by the show's curator, Germano Celant, and a wealth of other textual materials. But the main pleasure is delivered by the hundreds of crisp, color reproductions of Mr. Wesley's oddly comical, formally scrupulous, often erotic, cartoon-style images. Including drawings, studies and source materials relating to many particular paintings, it sheds light on the creative processes of a great American original. (Fondazione Prada, $130.) HEAT WAVES IN A SWAMP: THE PAINTINGS OF CHARLES BURCHFIELD. If you have ever wondered what the world looked like to Ralph Waldo Emerson when he was having an attack of transcendentalist ecstasy, you could do worse than to consult one of the glowing, shimmering landscape paintings that Charles Burchfield produced in the early and late phases of his career. They are among the highlights of a traveling exhibition now at the Hammer Museum and scheduled to open at the Whitney Museum of American Art in June. Surprisingly, that show was organized not by a museum curator but by the sculptor Robert Gober, whose simple, fragmentary notes in this excellent catalog provide an illuminating biographical background to Mr. Burchfield's pantheistic visions. (Hammer Museum and DelMonico Books-Prestel, $49.95.)"

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"The season's liveliest books about antiques cover stolen luxuries, unsung dead designers and the details of detecting fakes. The texts are full of did-you-knows that will no doubt impress your gift recipients or maybe even set off deep discussions about how history's vagaries shape what we own. Since at least the first century collectors have been tricked by forgeries: Pliny wrote about pervasive ''glass counterfeits'' in the gemstone trade, as the Swiss historian Jean-Jacques Fiechter points out in EGYPTIAN FAKES: MASTERPIECES THAT DUPED THE ART WORLD AND THE EXPERTS WHO UNCOVERED THEM (Flammarion, $45). The book is a paranoiac's dream, telling of new carvings that were bathed in acid, boiled in tobacco and rolled in bitumen dust to look and even smell old. Once a scam had been detected -- perhaps because the pharaoh statuette wig looked a little too Art Deco, or the scarab inscriptions had basic grammatical errors -- embarrassed owners sometimes just swept the problem under the rug by quietly selling it off."

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"The theater book of the season is unquestionably FREE FOR ALL: JOE PAPP, THE PUBLIC AND THE GREATEST THEATER STORY EVER TOLD (Doubleday, $39.95). Compiled by Kenneth Turan more than 20 years ago, with Papp's cooperation and input, the book was shelved when the ailing Papp expressed displeasure with the first draft. Emerging from the time capsule today, it is a juicy, exciting read, particularly the first half, which concentrates on Papp's life and career and the founding of the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Public Theater. The voices of more than 100 artists and administrators tell the story as they recall it. Papp emerges as a volatile and mercurial but always energetic figure, driven by a passion both for art and for the idea that theater should not be a pastime for the privileged but a source of joy and inspiration for everybody."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"How do you sell beer in a country where about 60 percent of the population is Muslim and forbidden by the government to buy it? Very carefully. Guinness Anchor, which has the largest market share of the three brewers in Malaysia, recently celebrated Guinness's 250th anniversary with a concert near Kuala Lumpur featuring the Black Eyed Peas. The company had to create a separate area where alcohol could be served and agreed not to use the word ''Guinness'' at the concert or in advertising promoting the event."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"PIXIES MINOTAUR You smell ''Minotaur'' first, faintly, a light musk wafting off the box. And what a box: a mottled brown, almost two feet long by more than a foot wide, with a pelt-like texture that's surprisingly soft, for a box, not at all unpleasant. It's heavy, too, at 25 pounds. The required heavy lifting (and spending) has a Darwinian effect; it selects its owners in a Herculean fashion, so brute in its presence that it demands attention. All five albums are here -- ''Come On Pilgrim,'' ''Surfer Rosa,'' ''Doolittle,'' ''Bossanova,'' ''Trompe Le Monde'' -- on 24-karat gold-plated CD and 180-gram vinyl and in Blu-ray audio. Let's face it, though: you have the music already (and if you don't, there are far more efficient ways to get it). Which is fine, because ''Minotaur'' isn't about music: it's about dedication, obsession, sense activation, one-upmanship, indie-rock consumer porn. Each copy is signed by the band and individually numbered, one of 3,000 made. The package was compiled by the graphic designer Vaughan Oliver and the photographer Simon Larbalestier, who collaborated on all of the original Pixies' album art. Their work is ghoulish and stark and tactile, captured here in an oversize book and a gicl√©e print, rough to the touch. This doorstopper of a set is called the ''limited'' edition: a ''deluxe'' version is available too, at one-quarter the weight and one-third the price, and with only half of the good stuff. But what sort of commitment is that? (Artist In Residence, five CDs, five records, two DVDs, one Blu-ray disc, two books and two posters, $495.) JON CARAMANICA"

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Art books and books about art may be two different things. Those in the first category show, with ample size and masses of pictures; those in the second tell, with writing on the subject outweighing reproductions of it. PAINTING ABSTRACTION: NEW ELEMENTS IN ABSTRACT PAINTING, a lively survey by the independent curator and critic Bob Nickas, is big and bright (six and a half pounds and cadmium red). Each of the 80 artists included in the book is represented by three or four full-page color images and a short essay (balancing show with tell). It is weighted toward young talent from New York, and not surprisingly peppered with artists Mr. Nickas has included in gallery group shows he has organized over the years. But it is great to have some order brought to ''the persistence of abstraction,'' as Mr. Nickas calls it. Think of this as a giant survey exhibition that didn't -- probably couldn't, maybe shouldn't -- happen, and a useful tool in forming a sharper, broader sense of what is going on in the world of abstract painting. (Phaidon, $75.) Also recommended from the same Phaidon series: PAINTING TODAY, by Tony Godfrey, which goes back to the 1980s for its nearly eye-bogglingly global view of the medium in all styles.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"BIG STAR KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY Big Star started out as a Memphis band that merely sought to outdo the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and the Byrds, adding some Memphis rock and soul. Big Star was already a slight throwback in the early 1970s but was also bursting with possibilities. It had open-ended studio time and some pop experience; one of its songwriters, Alex Chilton, had sung the Box Tops hit ''The Letter.'' But Big Star's fate was a perfectly disastrous combination of talent, musical ambition, personal temperament and bad luck. For Big Star's 1972 debut, ''#1 Record,'' it was led by Chris Bell and Mr. Chilton, a pairing that mixed lapidary, melodic songwriting and studio embellishments with a brash willingness to reveal every hope, fear and yearning. Mr. Bell left after ''#1 Record'' flopped, fumbled by its label. That left Mr. Chilton to lead a three-man band on the rawer, guitar-centered but still pop-minded ''Radio City.'' Then came ''3d,'' essentially a Chilton solo album assisted by Big Star's drummer, Jody Stephens. It held eerie, bereft songs in a paradoxically pretty orchestral haze: ''Nothing can hurt me,'' Mr. Chilton sang. ''Nothing can touch me.'' Latter-day fans reclaimed Big Star's albums as foundations of both crafty power-pop and disheveled indie-rock. This loving collection is virtually the complete 1970s Big Star: demos, a video clip, a 20-song live disc by the three-man band and the solo single Mr. Bell made before he died in a car accident. Alternate mixes, usually more cluttered, replace some original album tracks, but no matter: the fans already have those. (Rhino, four CDs, $69.98.) JON PARELES"

With top titles often costing $60 or more, buying a game that ends up unplayed can be a costly waste. Even worse, buying a violent video game meant for adults and giving it to a child just because it happens to be a video game is nothing less than negligent and irresponsible. So it is important to suit the game to the player. That said, the game industry in 2009 has something to offer just about everyone.

What follows is a shopping list of theater tickets, which has been annotated according to character, matching the sensibilities of shows with personality types.

How, after all, do you plan cities that grow by a few million inhabitants in less than a decade? LEARNING FROM HANGZHOU is a delirious effort to make sense of this historic urban phenomenon. The book, whose title is a witty reference to Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour's 1972 book, ''Learning From Las Vegas,'' examines everything from the Chinese city's rampant commercialization to the poor quality of housing for its migrant workers and the constant, 24-hour cycles of demolition and construction. This may be as close as you can get to seeing the future, and it's both euphoric and terrifying. (timezone8, $45.) Although women formed the majority of the Bauhaus's student body in its early years, the role they played in shaping the school's radical agenda has been largely ignored. Now BAUHAUS WOMEN comes along to correct the historical record. The book touches on how women's ideas about sexual liberation -- refusing to wear corsets, exercising bare-legged in city parks -- challenged the rigid class boundaries and sexual prudery of post-World War I Germany. But it was the spirit of creative collaboration they fostered -- mostly working in the school's textile, weaving, ceramics and industrial design workshops -- that helped define the Bauhaus's greatness.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"THERE are numerous ways to invent history, as seen in this year's assortment of boxed sets. Some prefer the full-catalog purge, and others the rarities and remixes. Some celebrate received wisdom; others, alternate stories. And when all that's done, some start over, taking another look with fresh eyes. That there would be only one way to go about the task is a folly fading more with each passing year. Here the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times review the notable boxed sets and anthologies of 2009. JON CARAMANICA AC/DC: 'BACKTRACKS' A set of B sides, Australia-only album tracks, live recordings and video from the full career of one of the most reliable bands in the world.

Unison guitar riffs, that comfortable stomp, up-front songs of domination and teasing. The DVD is almost worthless -- cheesy promo clips for commercials, mostly -- but the live disc, with good sound, is where it's at. From 1977 to 2000, from ''T.N.T.'' to ''Back in Black,'' through the lustiest crowd roars you've ever heard, the band is loud, steady and endlessly entertaining. (Sony Legacy, two CDs and one DVD, $39.98; a deluxe collector's edition, with an extra CD of live rarities, an extra DVD of a 2003 concert in Munich, an illustrated book and a vinyl LP of some of the studio material, is available only at acdcbacktracks.com for $199.) BEN RATLIFF TITE CURET ALONSO: ALMA DE POETA A court ruling in a copyright dispute early this year made it possible for disk jockeys and performers to play the songs of Tite Curet Alonso, probably the greatest composer of salsa. The reaction was immediate: a stadium concert in San Juan, P.R., celebrating his music, and this two-disc selection of his greatest songs, as performed by various artists. If you're like me, you're used to listening to salsa by group or singer, not by songwriter, but here are some of the sharpest and most moving songs the genre produced in the 1960s and '70s: ''La Tirana,'' by La Lupe; ''Peri√≥dico de Ayer,'' by H√©ctor Lavoe; ''La Esencia del Guaguanc√≥,'' by Willie Rosario; ''Anacaona,'' by Cheo Feliciano.

BEN RATLIFF JOHN COLTRANE: SIDE STEPS Before he cleaned up his life, got his own band and made some of the best jazz records ever, John Coltrane worked as a sideman over and over again in ad hoc bands for Prestige Records, a label that pumped out product with loose quality control. ''Side Steps'' collects albums released under the leadership of Elmo Hope, Tadd Dameron, Red Garland, Sonny Rollins, Gene Ammons, Mal Waldron and the tuba player Ray Draper. On average, they're ... average. (Rollins's ''Tenor Madness,'' with its famous Rollins-Coltrane duel, and Garland's elegant ''Soul Junction'' constitute its peaks.) You can hear a great musician rising to his feet: especially by late 1957, Coltrane's sound is unmistakable. Still, these are records best understood as day work. (Prestige, five discs, $59.98.) BEN RATLIFF MILES DAVIS: THE COMPLETE COLUMBIA ALBUM COLLECTION What's not here? His beginnings as a New York bebopper; his ''Birth of the Cool'' period; a few great sessions from 1954; the beginnings of his 1950s quintet with John Coltrane; the worst of his late-period fusion. What's here? Absolutely everything else from 1957 to 1985, one new live recording (from the Isle of Wight, 1970) and a superb concert DVD of his quintet with Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock in 1967. The albums are mostly presented here in original form, without outtakes, as you might have known them when they first came out, but a lot crisper than they sounded back then. It's a story of an artist changing his music every year or so, remarkably uninterested in jazz as a genre but rather as a process, constructing one mountain after another and charging up it: ''Milestones,'' ''Miles Ahead,'' ''Kind of Blue,'' ''Nefertiti,'' ''In a Silent Way,'' ''Get Up With It.'' What, you don't like ''Get Up With It?'' You're among those who think he lost it after ''Filles de Kilimanjaro?'' Study this, and we'll talk.

But that cardboard could well bear the promise of a very personal experience, of a night that might turn out to be as reflective and intimate as a closely held hand mirror. What follows is a shopping list of theater tickets, which has been annotated according to character, matching the sensibilities of shows with personality types. (One small warning: It is probably best to avoid saying, ''I thought this show was so you,'' until after the recipient has used the tickets. To do so earlier would engender an irritating and prejudicial self-consciousness that no playgoer -- or play -- should ever be burdened with.)"

Compiled by Kenneth Turan more than 20 years ago, with Papp's cooperation and input, the book was shelved when the ailing Papp expressed displeasure with the first draft. Emerging from the time capsule today, it is a juicy, exciting read, particularly the first half, which concentrates on Papp's life and career and the founding of the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Public Theater. The voices of more than 100 artists and administrators tell the story as they recall it. Papp emerges as a volatile and mercurial but always energetic figure, driven by a passion both for art and for the idea that theater should not be a pastime for the privileged but a source of joy and inspiration for everybody."

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Is it a sign of the imminent end of days when Bob Dylan makes a Christmas album? Perhaps it's just further proof of the proposition that sooner or later, a career in music is bound to include something for the holidays. Christmas albums are concept albums, but the concept is supremely flexible: sincere or joshing, worshipful or iconoclastic, modest or bombastic, traditionalist or revisionist, somber or silly, all of which are represented (sometimes on the same album) by this year's releases. Here the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times unwrap some notable seasonal albums. JON PARELES TORI AMOS: MIDWINTER GRACES (Universal Republic; CD/DVD; $19.90) This high priestess of introspection addresses the season through a personal haze, wringing original music from the carols of her childhood. Gorgeously recorded and impeccably produced, ''Midwinter Graces'' includes some characteristic stunners, like ''Star of Wonder,'' inspired by the three kings from the East, and ''Holly, Ivy and Rose,'' with a dramatic Celtic lilt. The album also dwells in hymnlike serenity and diaphanous wonder, with only a few glaringly awkward moments, like ''Pink and Glitter,'' a big-band number that feels neither deft nor genuine. Throughout Ms. Amos shows herself to be right at home with the trappings of nativity, up to and including the frankincense. NATE CHINEN DAVID ARCHULETA: CHRISTMAS FROM THE HEART (Jive, $13.94) Of course: David Archuleta, after all, is basically a lamb, all youth, softness and gratitude. (On the cover of ''Christmas From the Heart'' he cracks an almost preposterous smile, as if you just said something that validated his life.) Aside from the last track, ''Melodies of Christmas,'' this music is not as cynical as his usual romantic dance-pop. Though his light, sweet, note-scooping alto comes unmistakably from the last 20 years of R&B, this record looks toward an older and stodgier tradition of record making, and takes it seriously. A full orchestra drapes itself over nearly every track, and the large-scale arrangements transcend the obvious, even borrowing a little ersatz Andalusian guitar for the climax of ''What Child Is This.'' As for Mr. Archuleta, he sings in a Hebraic-sounding French in ''Pat-a-Pan,'' Spanish in ''Riu Riu Chiu'' and Latin in ''Ave Maria.'' He's reaching. BEN RATLIFF"

Here is an sampling of readers' replies: The article describes a very common situation for those not in group plans. As a former sales rep for individual health plans, I used a 145-page guide of exclusions for pre-existing conditions, ''hazardous'' activities and occupations, out-of-limit weight, and use of certain medications. Many of my friends who are covered by company group plans just don't understand the high cost exposure potential and the exorbitant premiums of individual plans which still don't provide coverage for many illnesses. Many holders of such plans are covered for the catastrophic costs, but are reluctant to get the colonoscopy or the CT scans recommended by the doctor because of high deductibles. Not much chance for prevention when you can't afford to pay for it."

2009-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Among the loose ends left after Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin's visit to Paris was one that has proved particularly difficult to ignore: the 23,700-ton French warship that docked in the middle of St. Petersburg this week as part of an extended sales pitch to the Russian government. For months, Russian officials have been negotiating with France over the purchase of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship, at an estimated cost of up to $750 million, and a license to build several more in Russia. The high-tech ship would stand out in Russia's aging fleet. Vladimir S. Vysotsky, commander of the Russian Navy, noted this fall that if he had had access to such a ship during the 2008 war with Georgia, it ''would have allowed the Black Sea fleet to complete its mission within 40 minutes, not 26 hours.''"
2009-11-28T00:00:00Z,"The shuttle Atlantis glided to a flawless Florida landing on Friday, wrapping up an 11-day space station delivery mission and bringing a flight engineer, Nicole P. Stott, back to Earth after 91 days in space. Dropping out of a clear sky, the shuttle was guided to a tire-smoking touchdown at 9:44 a.m. by the commander, Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines, and the pilot, Capt. Barry E. Wilmore of the Navy -- the final chapter in a 4.4-million-mile voyage that began with blastoff on Nov. 16."
2009-11-28T00:00:00Z,"A Yale librarian who cast doubt last year on the origins of the Serenity Prayer, adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous and reprinted on countless knickknacks, says new evidence has persuaded him to retain the famed Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as the author in the next edition of The Yale Book of Quotations. The provenance of the prayer, which begins, ''God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,'' became a subject of controversy last year with the publication of an article by the librarian, Fred R. Shapiro, who is also the editor of the book of quotations. Mr. Shapiro had found archival materials that led him to express doubt that Niebuhr was the author."
2009-11-28T00:00:00Z,"Stuffed with data and bristling with footnotes, a new report on the federal HealthReform.gov Web site argues ''The Case for Change'' in health insurance. The report includes an interactive map that lets a reader click on any state to see how that state's residents and businesses would benefit -- from the Obama administration's viewpoint, at least -- from an overhaul of the insurance system. The site is operated by the Department of Health and Human Services, whose secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, introduced the report in a conference call this week."
2009-11-28T00:00:00Z,"IN New York City, where the unemployment rate remains at 10.3 percent, the jobless have started leaning hard on coffee shops and bookstores to get out of their tiny one-bedrooms and away from their annoying roommates. In these harsh, career-vanishing times, the members of this laptop brigade do everything they can to re-create the office environment they no longer have to complain about. How welcome they are varies. Some small coffeehouses have unplugged the wireless, nailed covers over electrical outlets and posted signs requesting no computer use during lunch. But the New York Public Library has kindly extended its hours at many branches, and behemoths like Starbucks and Barnes & Noble can afford to be more accommodating. At an overcrowded Midtown coffee shop, a barista recently made a woman a cup of coffee, then watched her set up a keyboard, put on headphones and start practicing piano. She's not the only one working in public. Here are portraits of four other New Yorkers trying to get back to the comfort of their offices:"

His sets typically encompass songs by Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans, the Catalan folk art of Frederic Mompou and Cuban boleros. This week he's performing his own takes on the music from Miles Davis's album ''Kind of Blue.'' His excellent band includes the flamenco singer Blas C√≥rdoba, the bassist Mario Rossy, the percussionist Israel (Pira√±a) Su√°rez and the dancer and palmero Tom√°s Moreno Romero, known as Tomasito. Why does a small band in a jazz club need a dancer? Because some kinds of motion qualify as music. Go see him: you'll understand.

2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"POSTHORN--Stanley. 24 December 1915 31 October 2009. Stanley Posthorn was a prominent public relations and marketing executive at Time Inc. who established a marketing presence for Fortune Magazine and was responsible for the innovative celebrity marketing campaigns at the then newly founded People Magazine that featured artists, politicians and celebrities such as Andy Warhol, Paul Newman, Joe Namath, Dinah Shore and many, many others. His efforts were largely responsible for People achieving the premier position in celebrity reporting that it still commands today. He died at the age 93 following a protracted illness according to his nephew Alan Dine. Posty, as he was to become known to his close friends, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He served with honor for over four years with the military, rising to the rank of captain. While serving in the conflict in France, he received a medal for bravery in action. After the war, Posty moved to New York and through his love of the theater and the fine arts he befriended artists such as Andy Warhol, Joe Brainard, Jim Dine, Ellsworth Kelly Rex Lau, Diane Mayo and Esteban Vicente, whose early work he collected. His art collection also included the works of Frank Stella, Robert Youngblood, Robert Rauschenberg and others. Over the years, he donated art works from his collection to numerous museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton. His Joe Brainard collection, donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was publicly shown in 2008. In addition to his volunteer leadership and philanthropy in the art world, Stanley actively supported the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where he provided gifts in the memory of his partner Norman Mann, and where his estate will create the Stanley Posthorn-Norman Mann Discovery Endowment Fund to support cutting edge research in perpetuity. His love for ""Ojay"" a Lakeland terrier, prompted him to include various animal shelters as major beneficiaries of his estate. Posty was also a founding member of the East End Gay Organization (EEGO) which fought back attempts to restrict Gays and Lesbians from congregating at Fowler Beach in Southampton. Posty will be remembered for his innovative and witty mind, for his readiness to share his personal views and opinions, his knowledge and experience in art and theater and for living a life that knew no boundaries. A memorial will be held honoring his life, work and friends. For more information please contact Posty2009@yahoo.com."

Renegade artist Robert Valenciano succumbed to his battle with cancer after a short stay at Cabrini Hospice in NYC, dying on November 13th in the arms of his sister Doris Caceres. Born in Santiago, Cuba on April 4, 1965, Robert and his sister left Cuba with their mother Leila Arrowsmith in 1970 immigrating to Union City, NJ. Robert was five years old. After moving to New York City in the early eighties, Robert became a prominent figure in the downtown gay club and bar scene, working and playing in numerous notorious late night clubs. A long time HIV/AIDS survivor, Robert was a challenging figure, a radical artist self-defined as having ""no commercial ambition."" His trajectory as an artist was kaleidoscopic, beginning as a self-taught fashion designer making one of a kind pieces for many downtown artists in the late eighties and early nineties. His inspiration and intuitive approach to creating moved him freely from fashion and poetry to composing electronic/computer generated music under the name ""Dwarf Colony."" For a time he also freelanced as a dresser for numerous Broadway theater productions. Along with drawing, collage and photography, Robert's mature work was punctuated by sculptures of carved wood; sexually aggressive forms encrusted with thousands of jeweled mirrors that are now in the hands of a few private collections. Robert's influential pioneering style, his generous free spirit and unapologetic approach to living life inspired all those who knew him. He is survived by his mother, Leila, his sister, Doris Caceres, her husband, John, and their children Olivia and Gabriel. Memorial services to celebrate and remember Robert's life will be held December 12th at 3pm at Grace and St. Paul's Church, 123 West 71st Street, NYC.

Yet no specific instrumentation or ensemble size is recommended, and though the musicians must play the 53 figures in order, they can do so at any tempo and with any number of repetitions.

2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"OLIVIA JUDSON The basis of evolutionary potential is clear enough in principle. Whether a population can evolve to cope with new circumstances depends on how much underlying genetic variation there is: do any individuals in the population have the genes to cope, even barely, with the new environment, or not? If not, everybody dies, and it's game over. If yes, evolution may come to the rescue, improving, as time goes by, the ability of individuals to cope in the new environment. What determines the extent of the underlying genetic variation? Factors such as how big the population is (bigger populations usually contain more genetic variation) and how often mutations occur. Let me give an example of how this works. Imagine you have a population of algae that have been living for generations in a comfy freshwater pool. Now suppose there's a ghastly accident and, all of a sudden, the pool becomes super-salty. Whether the algae will be able to survive depends on whether any individuals already have any capacity to survive and reproduce in salty water. If none of them do, they all die, and the population goes extinct. But if some do, then the survivors will reproduce, and over time, beneficial mutations will accumulate such that the algae get better and better at living in a high-salt environment."

Later in the chapter Nelson allows that while political correctness is not the ""all defining campus cultural force the right makes it out to be, it does operate, in some contexts absurdly."" His own example of absurdity (it occurred in his home department) is a faculty appointment that was derailed when it was discovered that the candidate, then teaching in New Zealand, had written a letter to a newspaper criticizing the practice of going barefoot in public places on the grounds that it promoted the spread of disease. A department member decided that the letter ""was an attack on the Maori people and thus racist,"" and even when it was determined that it is not the Maori, but ""white hippies, who go barefoot in New Zealand, the majority voted against pursuing the candidate in order, says Nelson, to prove ""themselves to colleagues of color."""

In a review in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that Mr. Winterbottom had performed a valuable service by inoculating Sterne's book ''against the depredations of earnest, prestige-minded adapters, while preserving a lot of the book's insouciant, inventive spirit (and some of its best moments),'' adding, ''He has also paid loving, knowing tribute to the crazy enterprise of filmmaking, a torment to those mad enough to pursue it and a delight, at least in this case, for those of us lucky enough to sit and watch.'' 8 P.M.

2009-11-30T00:00:00Z,"JOSEPH--Frederick H.,of New York City and Andover, MA died on November 27, 2009. Born in Boston, MA in 1937, he was the son of Sara Mostowitz Joseph and the late Edward Morris Joseph. Mr. Joseph received an A.B. from Harvard College in 1959, and subsequently served as an ensign aboard the minesweeper USS Exultant, where he received a letter of commendation for devotion to duty for fighting a fire aboard ship. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. in 1963, Mr. Joseph began his career at E.F. Hutton in corporate finance, where he was trained by his friend and mentor John Shad. He joined Shearson Hammill's corporate finance department in 1970, and in 1973, was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Joseph joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1974 to co-manage the company's corporate finance department, and became Chief Executive Officer in May 1985. Drexel is credited with the commercialization of the high yield bond market, having underwritten more than 1500 issues and raising more than $158 billion from 1978 through 1989. This included many financings of less than $100 million, some of which funded entrepreneurial venture capitalists including Steve Wynn, T. Boone Pickens, and Ted Turner. From January 1994 until May 1998, Mr. Joseph was Chairman of Clovebrook Capital Corp., a boutique investment banking firm. From May 1998 until April 2001, he was a Senior Advisor and Managing Director of ING Barings LLC. Mr. Joseph returned to focus on middle market companies with Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, Inc., which was renamed Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc. in October 2002. Morgan Joseph since has developed into a company of more than 140 employees, which has completed more than $29 billion in transactions, including more than 140 M&A transactions and 90 financings. Mr. Joseph was a passionate outdoorsman and hobbyist. Hunting, farming, and horseback riding were an integral part of his life. He traveled through much of the US and Canada on hunting trips, frequently accompanied by friends, sons-in-law and grandchildren. His trophies included a Pope and Young-rated black bear and a Pope and Young rated atypical white-tailed deer. He also participated in numerous Outward Bound and NOLS exploration courses, including one to Africa with his son, Mark, and one to Mexico with his daughter, Tommi Beth, and her husband, Mike. He was often found working in his home blacksmith forge, where he designed and forged his own tools. He is survived by his wife, Linn Anderson of Andover, MA and her son Andrew Prezkop of Washington, DC; his children: Lisa and Bill Schultz of Summit, NJ; Melinda Burke of Brooklyn, NY; Amy and Jon Humphreys of Summit, NJ; Tommi Beth and Mike McHugh of Denver, CO; and Mark and Starry Joseph of Gloucester, MA; and his former wife, Susan Joseph of New Vernon, NJ. He was the beloved grandfather of Billy and Krissy Schultz, Charlotte and Daniel Burke, Molly and Olivia Humphreys and Lucy McHugh. He is also survived by his brother Stephen Joseph and wife Angelique Craney of Chester, CT and New York City; his sister Michelle Joseph Morris and husband Chris of Williamsburg, MA; his mother, Sara Joseph, as well as numerous nieces and nephews. Mr. Joseph was a member of the Board of Directors of several companies, a Trustee of WNET/Channel Thirteen, and a Director of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

The next he was offering the Taliban a date to circle on their calendars, and hold out for throughout the American offensive to come - July of 2011, that is, when the Obama administration is now committed to beginning the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. This commitment, of course, was hedged with a substantial caveat: ""We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground.""

2009-12-01T00:00:00Z,"The last time the New England Patriots played at the Louisiana Superdome, they won their first Super Bowl and launched a dynasty. New Orleans Saints Coach Sean Payton used a Pro Bowl fishing trip three years ago to quiz Bill Belichick about the details of his seasons, the practice schedules, the personnel moves, hoping to divine the secrets that had won the Patriots two more Super Bowls since that stunner eight years ago. Lesson learned. On Monday, with playoff-level excitement in the city, the Saints eclipsed the Patriots as the N.F.L.'s most explosive team, whipping them, 38-17, and keeping the Saints' undefeated season alive at 11-0. With the Colts also at 11-0, this is the deepest into a season two teams have gone undefeated. Two years ago, that was the Patriots. Not anymore. They are 7-4 and still lead the American Football Conference East by two games. But with victories over only two teams with winning records and a flailing defense that gave up a combined 73 points to the Colts and the Saints, the Patriots look vulnerable against the league's elite teams. For the Saints, though, this could be a franchise-altering victory, one that finally vanquishes their long-held reputations as losers."

2009-12-01T00:00:00Z,"As they determine how to address more pressing needs in left field and in their rotation, the Mets have turned their attention to improving the bench. They agreed to a one-year deal with the utility infielder and the clubhouse leader Alex Cora. And the Mets also agreed to terms with catcher Chris Coste and are also showing interest in another catcher, the free agent Henry Blanco. Originally signed to provide capable middle-infield depth, Cora took over at shortstop after Jose Reyes was lost in mid-May with a hamstring injury. He batted .251 and started 67 games -- 54 at shortstop, 13 at second base -- and played most of them with a torn ligament in his right thumb. After he tore a ligament in his left thumb in August, Cora, 34, elected to have season-ending surgery. Cora's professionalism and insistence on playing hurt earned him immediate respect in the Mets' clubhouse, where he mentored Fernando Martinez and encouraged Mike Pelfrey throughout his disappointing season.

2009-12-02T00:00:00Z,"SIMEONOWA--Raina, Bulgarian opera singer, died on September 1st at Lennox Hill hospital after an accidental fall in her apartment in New York two days earlier which resulted in a sub-dural hematoma. She was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and has performed at some of the leading opera houses during her long career. Her voice was that of a coloratura soprano. Her premiere role was that of ""The Queen of the Night"" in Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"", which requires the singer to reach the highest notes of any operatic work. Graduating from musical academy in Sofia, in the early 1940s, Ms. Simeonowa went to Austria to complete her operatic training. The war prevented her from returning to her home and she remained in Austria until the war's end. Later she went to Germany and entertained the American troops throughout Germany with popular songs in seven languages. In 1948, she signed her first opera contract in Kaiserlauten and remained there for two years where she performed with numerous opera companies where these companies would share their singers as back-ups if one of their own became incapacitated. The capstone of her career was when she was selected to perform as the Queen of the Night at the Salzburg Music Festival in Austria. She replaced the scheduled performer who had suddenly become ill. On 24 hours notice, she was fitted into the appropriate costume, rehearsed and performed this difficult role to great acclaim. Ms. Simeonowa came to the United States to continue her career in this country. She auditioned for Rudolph Bing, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and several months later received a call from his office to meet with Mr. Bing. Unfortunately, she had received a call from a German opera company and left for Europe the day after receiving Mr. Bings' call. In the United States, Ms. Simeonowa sang on numerous concert stages and reprised her role in The Magic Flute with the San Francisco Opera company with great success. Ms. Simeonowa leaves her husband, Benjamin Kinberg, a product designer and two sons, Boris, percussionist of Mink DeVille, and Max, a composer who resides and works in Hollywood. Also, Harley, a granddaughter and Susan, her daughter-in-law."

He was a father to Chip, George, Jon and Ronald; grandfather of Kasey, Sami, Jared and Cara; and forever husband and life friend of Elise.

But it's at least old enough to have been demonstrated to me in Rome in 1976, and I imagine as old as pasta itself. In this method, the liquid is minimized: there's no need for a gallon per pound of pasta. The liquid is added gradually to the pasta, which absorbs it completely and thereby retains its starch. This makes the pasta creamy and rich; it also gains the flavor of the stock."

Affectionately known as Bud, he was surrounded by many of them this past Thanksgiving as he proposed a toast celebrating the love his family shared. After serving in the Army during World War II, Morton graduated from the Columbia University School of Engineering, and joined New York City consulting engineering firm of Weiskopf & Pickworth in 1948. During the 1950s he helped build the firm through collaboration with prominent architects, brining it to the fore of modernism in the United States. In 1960 he became Senior Partner and forged strong working relationships with many leading architects. Active with the firm for over 40 years, he retired in 1990. Morton remained a partner in Olde Post Mall Associates in Fishkill, New York. He also served as President of Beechwood Homeowners Association, a townhouse development at which he and Beverly resided for twenty years. Morton was an aficionado of all the arts, including opera, theater and concerts, was an accomplished cenophile. He also delighted in traveling the world, and always remained a student of different cultures and architecture. As the active patriarch of an extended family, he was known and loved for his generosity of spirit, time, love and humor. He will be missed by all. Funeral services will be held Friday, December 4, 10:30am, at Bet Torah Synagogue, 60 Smith Avenue, Mt. Kisco, NY.

A Foreign Office spokesman in London, speaking in return for customary anonymity, said the men's yacht was being towed to international waters, where it would be met by race organizers. Iran had earlier warned that it would put the sailors on trial and take ''serious'' measures if they were found to have harbored ''evil intentions.'' The episode coincided with mounting tension between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program, although British officials sought to avoid publicly linking the two. ''We reached the conclusion that they entered Iran's territorial waters by mistake,'' a broadcast on Iranian state radio said, quoting a statement issued by the Revolutionary Guards."

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restrictive, but that the film industry is putting out more unrated DVDs that may include material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for theatrical release. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a shopper survey by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising. The gaming industry, the report said, has ‚Äúthe strongest self-regulatory code,‚Äù and has generally strong compliance with its standards."

Wright II of the United States District Court for the Central District of California has had some interesting bedtime reading over the past few months. Before dismissing a plagiarism case brought by the author Jordan Scott against Stephenie Meyer, above, the author of the blockbuster best-selling ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù series, Judge Wright (or his clerks) had to read both ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn,‚Äù the fourth and final (we think) installment in the ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù series, and ‚ÄúThe Nocturne,‚Äù Ms. Scott‚Äôs novel, the first in a projected trilogy, to make extensive comparisons. Ms. Scott had suggested that because of similarities in the novels, involving a wedding, a consummation scene on the beach and a subsequent childbirth, that Ms. Meyer had copied Ms. Scott‚Äôs work. In a decision filed late last month, Judge Wright ruled that the novels were ‚Äúnot substantially similar as a matter of law‚Äù and admonished Ms. Scott for her ‚Äúdeceptive presentation of the alleged similarities.‚Äù Among the judge‚Äôs many detailed comparisons, he found that the dialogue in both books was substantially different. The speech in ‚ÄúThe Nocturne,‚Äù he wrote, is ‚Äúan amalgamation of largely archaic and some modern language that is likely unparalleled in either classical or modern literature.‚Äù By contrast, the dialogue in ‚ÄúBreaking Dawn,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúmaintains a very modern and fresh tone throughout the story that is appealing to a younger audience.‚Äù."

She was 99 years old, days away from living a century. The persevering matriarch of our family died with her daughters and grandchildren at her side. With a passion for drawing, painting, literature and music, Eve defined herself by her sense of aesthetic. She was a true woman of the world, irreverent and ahead of her time. She is survived by her daughters, Judith Elkins and Nina Klein, Sons-in-law Paul Elkins and Peter Klein, grandchildren, Lisanne, David and wife Aliciane; Sonja and husband, Ben; Talya, Avi, and wife, Kate and four great-grandchildren: Emily, Olivia, Riley and Daniel.

In the end, the board wanted a new face who could change the company faster. ''My biggest strength is I've been with G.M. for 25 years,'' Mr. Henderson reportedly remarked, ''and my biggest weakness is that I have been with G.M. for 25 years.''"

The program's nine months of tours, discussions and online activities are designed to celebrate and preserve L.A.'s modern architecture, cementing the notion that the sites are, in fact, historic. In the 1960s the city became the epicenter of innovation, thanks not only to the tract houses built after the Case Study Houses program but also to cerebral works like the Los Angeles International Airport Theme Building, the Music Center by Welton Becket in Bunker Hill, the now endangered Century Plaza Hotel by Minoru Yamasaki (left) and the space-pod Chemosphere house by John Lautner.

The temporary pavilion at this year's fair made a deliberately monumental statement, as opposed to the ethereal, dematerialized one in 2008. (Both were designed by the New York architects ArandaLasch.) And in contrast to last year's daylight-filled interiors, this year's were theatrically lighted ''to focus attention on the 'actors' -- the furniture and people,'' according to Ambra Medda, Design Miami's director and co-founder. Chief among them was Maarten Baas, the 2009 Designer of the Year, who showed, among other things, an ''evolution'' of the ''Real Time'' video clock series that drew raves during Milan's design week. In a similar vein, Fendi and Design Miami built on last spring's ''Craft Punk'' exhibition, now with a little less craft and a little more technology, to demonstrate that the two ''are not in opposition,'' Medda said. The design-tech wizard Moritz Waldemeyer customized Gibson guitars with lasers; when the guitars are played (as they were, at a party, by the band OK Go), the lasers ''illustrate'' the music on a video wall. HSBC commissioned a bench from Arik Levy, while Swarovski presented a crystal sail designed by the Los Angeles architect (and avid sailor) Greg Lynn.

(Last winter, he went so far as to style his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, apartment like a 1970s rec room.) But nothing has brought him more fame or funds than his Superordinate Antler Lamps. To Miller, the success of a big, expensive ceramic chandelier makes total sense. ''A light is the first thing people notice when they walk into a room,'' he says, ''so you want it to say something, and you're willing to pay more for it.'' With that in mind, Miller has created an as-yet-unnamed lighting firm, with products set to make their debut at next spring's furniture fair in New York. He will produce his own work and will cherry-pick the best of his colleagues', like Paul Loebach's triangulated aluminum Himmeli lights or Sarah Cihat and Michael Miller's rocker-chic porcelain-and-chain lamps.

''I remember playing under a tall, heavy, black, magical sculpture that I pretended was a castle,'' Isabel says. ''I later recognized it was a Victorian Singer sewing machine.'' Today Ruben and Isabel exist in a kind of creative cocoon, with her carefully constructed clothes the ying to his artist's yang. ''The ease of assimilation is this country's secret genius,'' says Ruben, who met Isabel in high school in New Jersey. ''Everyone can participate. It's not by invitation only.''"
2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"The Kindle, an electronic reader brought out by Amazon two years ago, has become your company's best-selling product and a great success story. But several rival e-readers are coming out in time for Christmas. What do you think of the Nook, for instance, from Barnes & Noble? We have a long tradition of not talking about other companies, which I'll stick to. Barnes & Noble claims on its Web site that the Nook has several advantages over the Kindle -- for one thing, a Nook book can be lent to friends. You can forward the text to another user. The current thing being talked about is extremely limited. You can lend to one friend. One time. You can't pick two friends, not even serially, so once you've loaned one book to one friend, that's it."

In the final room of the exhibition are several large journals full of hand-written dedications to Jackson.

You unscrew this, measure that and stir it all together. For dramatic effect, you might wait until your guests arrive before popping the Champagne. Then relax and have a drink -- the work is done.

That doesn't sound good -- and it's not, if you're a Japanese exporter or an American tourist. But it is potentially great news for American workers.

But there are also more predictable effects replayed in each decline. Below, a falling dollar scorecard."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"In the last year, while dealing with the many challenges (cyclical and structural) in the publishing industry, I have often asked myself what America stands for and what a magazine is today. As a foreigner who moved to the United States almost 20 years ago and as a journalist who started working in print much earlier, I can say that America and magazines are the great loves of my life. Unfortunately, both are very much under attack and, in the opinion of some, on the road to extinction.

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"SCHARFSTEIN--Sol, one of America's leading Jewish authors, scholars and educators, died yesterday in Livingston, NJ, at age 88. He was President of KTAV Publishing House, Inc., a publisher of Hebrew and English textbooks, scholarly Judaica, and prayer books that educated the world-wide Jewish community for three generations. Sol Scharfstein has written and created more than 100 textbooks and educational devices with subjects including the Hebrew language, history, prayer, the Bible and children's stories. His first book, Haveri, published in 1954, was the first Hebrew language textbook published in full color and has sold over 1 million copies. It is still in print. His latest book, which has received much critical acclaim, is The Five Books of Moses: An Easy-to-Read Torah Translation. In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from Yeshiva University for his contribution to Jewish education. Sol Scharfstein was born in 1921 to Fannie and Asher Scharfstein in Dinivetz, Russia and came to America at the age of six months. He graduated Stuyvesant High School in New York in 1939 and enrolled in New York University. His studies were interrupted when he enlisted in the army during World War II. He served in the European Theater of Operations from 1941-1943. Scharfstein graduated from New York University in 1945 with a B.S. in Chemistry. He also graduated Herzliah Hebrew Teachers College. He joined the family business, KTAV Publishing House in 1945. Scharfstein headed a delegation of Jewish publishers to the Soviet Union in 1981 during the Cold War. This was the first exhibit of Jewish publications since the establishment of the Communist regime in 1917. Scharfstein married Edythe Shore in 1946, who survives him. In addition to his wife Edythe, he is survived by his children Alan (Karen), Janet (Jay), Joel (Deborah) and brother Bernie (Barbara) and seven grandchildren."

I pray every day that some overeager associate won't sell it by mistake.

Waste is the antithesis of frugality, and unnecessary belongings can make travel more difficult than it already is. The same logic also operates in the holiday season. I don't want to give -- or receive -- anything that, while momentarily amusing, fails to provide a useful function, or on the other hand is functional but charmless.

The crazy fools seem to think that their husbands are not sufficiently tormented unless they wear the value of an inheritance in each ear.'' Of course, women -- and an Indian maharajah or two -- would go on to do a lot more with pearls than bedizen their ears. At the height of the pearl's importance in Elizabethan England, the queen thought nothing of scattering hundreds over everything she wore, including her hair."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"The National Football Conference has become a two-team race. The brutal, efficient Minnesota Vikings (10-1) are in one corner, and the electrifying New Orleans Saints are in the other. All other contenders are just fodder. Dallas will fumble the holidays away, Philadelphia will suffer an eight-field-goal 27-24 wild-card loss, and Green Bay will have a break-even game in which it gains 400 yards from scrimmage but gives 399 of them back on sacks and penalties. The Arizona Cardinals (7-4) are a small step above the other conference midmajors, but their hopes rest with Kurt Warner, whose possible absence drains some appeal from a Warner-versus-Brett Favre battle of American alpha-male archetypes. The confluence of concussion complications and complicated league concussion policies make it impossible to determine a player's status until he jogs onto the field. Warner practiced, but he visited an ophthalmologist. A quarterback seeing double against the Vikings risks getting sacked by four Williamses, so assume nothing."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"SCHROEDER--Herman Elbert, died November 28, 2009 at Stonegates, Greenville, DE. He delighted in family, friends and colleagues worldwide, nature, photography, and exploring other cultures, but above all, science. He explained, ""forces which impel me are largely the compulsion to look for the new, to change for the better, be it by finding better ways to do things or by inventing products to make the world function better. Gratifyingly, these often make the world aesthetically more pleasant and sometimes cleaner."" Born in Brooklyn in 1915, he graduated from Polytechnic Country Day School 1932, Harvard AB 1936, AM 1937, PhD 1939. After joining DuPont in 1938, he developed the first practical adhesive for bonding rubber to nylon for B-29 bomber tires, discovered light-fast dyes for cotton, led development of dyes for polyester and acrylic fibers, and served as DuPont's Director of Research and Development for synthetic rubbers and plastics from 1963-1980. Herman contributed to the development of a variety of specialty elastomers including DuPont's pioneering work on polyetherurethanes which led to ADIPRENE, CORFAM and LYCRA; the first sulfur-curable ethylene propylene rubber NORDEL; HYTREL thermoplastic polyetherester; VITON and KALREZ fluoroelastomers; and VAMAC ethylene acrylic elastomer. He held 37 patents, published 40 papers, and edited treatises on thermoplastic elastomers. He served on advisory groups for the British High Polymer Institute, Harvard University, Industrial Research Institute, International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, Textile Research Institute, University of Delaware Research Foundation, US Armed Forces, US Department of Commerce, and Winterthur Museum. To help preserve art treasures for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he gave technical advice on chemical reactions and their detrimental effect over time. He was honored by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers, and received the Charles Goodyear Medal from the American Chemical Society. DuPont awarded him the Lavoisier Medal for Inspirational Research Leadership in 1992. He is predeceased by beloved wife Elizabeth and daughter and son-in-law, Nancy Carolyn and Dennis Tarczy and dear sister, Rose Brady. Survivors include two sons Edward Schroeder (Carol), Peter Schroeder (Linda) and daughter Martha Lewis (Charles), seven grandchildren, thirteen great-grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and many dearly valued friends.

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"After Walter Cronkite died earlier this year, Frank Mankiewicz, the onetime Democratic operative, recalled in The Washington Post how he had proposed that George McGovern select the CBS anchorman as his running mate during the 1972 presidential campaign. Cronkite was, of course, one of the most admired men in America and a known skeptic of the war in Vietnam. And yet McGovern's others advisers unanimously rejected the Cronkite gamble, not just because they feared he would say no but also because the boundary between journalism and elective office was so absolute that the thought of merging them struck aides as too desperate a ploy. Cronkite was ''wholly outside of politics,'' as Mankiewicz described it. Voters and party leaders, it was thought, could no more accept a newsman as a Democratic spokesman than they could imagine a politician broadcasting the evening news. Now it seems that Cronkite's brief moment as a vice-presidential contender may have been the first inevitable step down a treacherous path. Today we're not at all surprised to hear names like Chris Matthews and Lou Dobbs tossed around as candidates for higher office. And while it used to be that only political aides of notable talent, people like Bill Moyers and Pat Buchanan and George Stephanopoulos (and, well, Chris Matthews), could make the tricky transition from politics to TV news, now it's the politicians themselves -- Joe Scarborough, Mike Huckabee -- who find themselves ensconced as hosts on a cable-TV set. The door between politics and television news now isn't merely revolving; it spins so fast and so continuously that a fair number of people no longer seem to belong neatly on one side or the other. Is Sarah Palin, at this point, a politician, or is she the star of some ''frontier family'' reality show? In fact, she seems to realize that the changed environment allows her to be both at the same time."

''I've always been influenced by the kaleidoscope of memories I carry back from my travels,'' he says, adding that quintessential Americana like surfing, fireworks, tornadoes, Mae West and the Brooklyn Bridge have also figured into his designs. L'Ame du Voyage -- Louis Vuitton's most ambitious foray into high jewelry to date -- contains six sets of jewels that each orbit a one-of-a-kind necklace. They all boast the new Louis Vuitton Flower or Star diamond cuts, inspired by the company's Monogram print, and some have fragments of a gold ''lace'' that Baumer designed with the logo in mind.

Most work for tips or minimum wage, and have the opportunity to buy health insurance through the company's group plan. Applicants to the new Applebee's, one of 20 now open in New York City, included people with college degrees, people who had worked at high-end restaurants, people who had applied for dozens of other jobs -- perhaps not surprising in the Bronx, the county with the highest unemployment rate in the state, 13.4 percent. About a half-dozen of the new hires came from other Applebee's locations.

The boys would have names that are verbs, like Hunt and Pierce, and the girls would be named after food, like Pina and Coco Vin, in languages I cannot speak. They'd come from exotic places like Laos and the Ivory Coast. But kids break things and fall prey to pricey franchises like Webkinz. So, why adopt real orphans when you can take in an American Girl doll? At $95, it's a sounder investment in our troubled economy. There's Kirsten Larson, who left Scandinavia with her parents to settle in Minnesota in the 1800s, and Felicity Merriman, who lived through the hardships of the Revolutionary War -- two lovable girls who can't sass and jam up your DVR with episodes of ''The Suite Life on Deck.'' Better yet, the dolls come with biographies. Their fates are pretty much sealed, so they can't blame you for messing them up during those troublesome teenage years. (Save maybe Gwen Thompson, the latest American Girl, who at one point was homeless and lived in a car.)

The fair is about the commerce of bling, not the transformation of the spirit. Yet that is what arrived on Friday night, when the filmmaker Tamra Davis previewed her new documentary, ""Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child,"" at the Colony Theater on Lincoln Road.The film, which will premiere next month at the Sundance Film Festival, was a labor of love for Davis, who met the artist in 1983 and, with the screenwriter Becky Johnston, interviewed him on camera two years before his death, at age 27, from a heroin overdose. That was in 1988. Davis then put the footage away until a traveling museum retrospective made it clear that there was little of the actual Basquiat on film. (He played a character role in ""Downtown '81,"" and Julian Schnabel's ""Basquiat,"" with Jeffrey Wright in the title role, was partly fiction.)"

As it turns out, the strain of the downturn hasn't pushed the divorce rate higher; instead, economic stress seems to have made American marriages slightly more stable overall, as couples develop a ""new appreciation for the economic and social support that marriage can provide in tough times,"" as the study's lead author, Brad Wilcox, puts it. Americans are also turning thriftier (saving more, cutting down on credit card debt, reviving home-based economies, etc.), which is good news for wedlock, since financial stability correlates with marital stability, and with marital happiness as well. If you squint a little at the data, you could even imagine that the recession, and the adjustments required by long periods of unemployment, might ""accelerate the social acceptance of women as equal breadwinners and men as capable parents and homemakers,"" as Christine Whalen writes in an accompanying essay, and make the institution of marriage more flexible and resilient in the long run."

The (unlikely) scenario I spun out, in which a reinvigorated Islam manages a sweeping ""transformation of European culture,"" with a Ramadan-esque figure playing ""a Muslim Saint Paul to the E.U.'s Roman Empire,"" is one that I would regard with enormous dismay should it ever come to pass.

Chu, the Albert Ferguson associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and director of the Cartilage Restoration Center there, confirmed a theory, and found herself troubled by the results. It turned out that if you dropped a heavy weight onto parts of a cow's knee joint from various heights, the joint was hurt. (While the parts of the joint were damaged, the cow itself was uninjured by the experiment; the knees came from a local abattoir.) When the weight hit the joint's surface cartilage with great speed and force, the bone and cartilage fractured. No surprise there. But it is what happened in Dr. Chu's experiment when the impact was more subtle - closer to, for instance, the perturbations inside a human knee when a ligament is torn - that concerned her. She found that with lighter impact, the various parts of the knee appeared, visually at least, to be fine."
