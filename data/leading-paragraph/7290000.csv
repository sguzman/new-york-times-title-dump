He was one of the first young German businessmen who started working with the garment center in New York. He became the most successful women's wear manufacturer in Germany. He was a pioneer in building understanding between cultures and was admired and respected not only in the business community but in his personal life. In his later years he shifted his interest in the textile industry to the Eastern European countries and Russia and became a pioneer in building bridges internationally between these cultures and the rest of the world. At one time he was the biggest self-made industrialist devoted to women's wear in Europe. But he always made time for his soccer hobby, fine food and wine, the Club of Rome, and his friends.

He is survived by his wife of 29 years, actress Bonnie Franklin, his daughter Julie and her husband Glenn Mar, his son Jed and his wife Madoka, his two granddaughters, Natasha MarMinoff and Maya Grace Minoff, his brother Bruce and his wife Susan. He was the much-loved uncle of Melissa Minoff, artist Edward Minoff, and the godfather of Adam Bush. Born June 26, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York, Marvin attended Lincoln High School, Syracuse University and NYU before entering the U.S. Army, where he served in intelligence during the Korean War. Returning to New York, Minoff joined the William Morris Agency. In 15 years he rose quickly at two major agencies, William Morris and International Famous Artists (today's ICM), and became vice president of the motion picture department. He represented renowned actors, writers and directors such as Cicely Tyson, Sidney Lumet, David W. Rintels and Bruce Joel Rubin while packaging such blockbusters as ""The French Connection"" and ""Love Story."" His triumphs as an agent were always featured in Variety as ""Another success by Marvin Minoff, son of famed theatrical haberdasher Harry Minoff,"" a tip of the hat to his father, who owned a clothing store up the street. Minoff left the agency business in 1974 to become president of David Frost's David Paradine Television, Inc., where he co-produced with Frost the historic ""Nixon Interviews,"" as well as subsequent interviews with Henry Kissinger and the Shah of Iran. While at Paradine he also produced James Michener's ""Dynasty,"" ""The Ordeal of Patty Hearst,"" and ""Portrait of a Rebel: Margaret Sanger,"" starring his soon-to-be wife Bonnie Franklin. After leaving Paradine he continued as an independent producer until 1985, when he formed Farrell/Minoff Productions, a partnership with actor/writer Mike Farrell. The pair worked together for the next quarter century, producing motion pictures for television starring such luminaries as Shelley Fabares, Fred Savage, Helen Hunt, Tess Harper, Patricia Wettig, Jill Clayburgh, Missy Crider and Edward Asner, along with two features: the award-winning ""Dominick and Eugene"" starring Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta for Orion Pictures and Universal's ""Patch Adams,"" starring Robin Williams. A beloved and highly respected veteran of ""The show-biz wars,"" Minoff enjoyed the esteem of all those with whom he worked and was universally regarded as that rare thing in the business: an honest man. Services will be held Sunday at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills at 11am."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"ARMSTRONG--John Chace, died on November 4th, 2009 in Shelburne, VT from complications of aortic stenosis, a disease that robbed him of his energy and a bit of his memory, but never his analytic mind. He was delivered to the Lord peacefully, at his home, under the light of a full moon and a clear sky. John was born in 1918 in Rochester, NY, the only child of George S. and Dorothy M. Armstrong. Raised in Riverside, CT, he attended Riverside School, Brunswick School and Deerfield Academy. He graduated from Williams College and New York University. After a brief period of employment with Dupont, John went on to work with his father's firm, the George S. Armstrong Company, in New York City. He worked there as a consulting engineer until his retirement as president of the company in 1995. John married Helga Evensen in 1950 and, until her untimely death in 1974, raised their three daughters together. His unfailing and absolute devotion to his children and their wellbeing stirred his spirit until his last breath. He was married to Mary Helen Post Hurlimann from 1977 until 2001. While he held her three daughters, Mary Ann, Lily and Sandy, in the highest regard and with much affection, Sandy held a piece of his heart. Aside from the pride he took in his work and the accomplishments of his children and grandchildren, John was deeply proud of his efforts on behalf of the New York University Alumni Federation. He leaves his children: Karin and her husband, Arthur Newhouse of Stowe, Vermont; Christine of Shelburne, Vermont; and Lise of South Burlington, Vermont. Grandchildren, Bart and wife, Amy, Kirsten and husband, Ben, Matthew, Anna Christina, Brendan, Christian and Lille, and great grandsons, Chace and Liam, cherish his memory. Private services were held on November 7, 2009 at the Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, CT. A Memorial Service will be held next summer (2010) in Greensboro, VT, John's lifelong and beloved summer home. Although John appreciated flowers, and loved both a woman who grew them and a woman who painted them, instead of flowers, he preferred that any memorials in his name be made to the John C. Armstrong Scholarship Fund at the New York University Alumni Federation, c/o Alan Shapiro, Director of Gift Planning, 25 W. 4th Street, 4th fl., NYC, NY 10012. (212.998.6960)."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"BRODY--Martin, died at age 88 in West Orange, NJ on October 29, 2009. He was the Chairman and CEO of Restaurant Associates (RA) from 1963-1992. Under Martin's leadership RA became one of the premier restaurant companies in the country known for their concept restaurant and high quality food service for major institutional clients. Born in 1921 in a cold water flat in Newark, NJ, Martin started working in his father's business, Rain or Shine, at nine years old. Rain or Shine was a box lunch company that thrived during the Depression selling prepackaged lunches to factory workers throughout Essex County. He graduated from Weequahic High School and Michigan State University. He enlisted in the army during World War II. In 1946, he returned home a Captain and joined the family business. He met Florence Brody (formerly Gropper) on a blind date and they were married 6 months later. After the family business had grown from 1 to 60 trucks, Martin engineered its sale in 1961. Two years later, he became Chairman, President and CEO of RA by merging Waldorf Systems with RA. RA created and owned such renowned NYC restaurants as The Four Seasons, The Forum, Mama Leones, Tavern on the Green, Brasserie, La Fonda del Sol, and Sea Grill. The food service division included such institutions as Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center, United Nations, Metropolitan Museum, Harvard Club, Ford Foundation and the U.S. Open. Nationwide operations included Charlie Brown's and Acapulco restaurant chains, and Eastern News Stands. Born of immigrant parents, his mother was pregnant with Martin when they came to this country from Budapest. Martin literally went from Ellis Island to the boardroom. He was known among his peers and colleagues for his inspirational leadership and altruism. At an early age he was invited to join the Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and later World Presidents Organization. He served 10 years as the Chairman of the Executive Committee for Caldor, which was later purchased by Associated Dry Goods, a merger initiated by Mr. Brody. Other board positions included: Boston Celtics, Dollar Savings Bank, Leisure Technology, Jaclyn, Washington National Life Insurance Company and countless Smith Barney Mutual Funds. He also served on the American Stock Exchange Advisory Committee for eight years. Martin was a true humanitarian whose generosity and leadership in community affairs touched countless lives. His nonprofit and civic work included 14 years on the board of St. Barnabas Healthcare System, the largest healthcare system in the state of NJ. He served eight years as Chairman of St. Barnabas and in 1977 was awarded an honorary lifetime trusteeship. For 13 years he was Chairman of the Finance Committee for the NJ Transit Authority Board. A plaque at Penn Station in Newark commemorates his 20 years of outstanding service. In addition he served on the NJ State Board of Institutions and Agencies and was a Commissioner on the Governor's Management Review Commission. He served on the board of Temple B'Nai Abraham and the South Palm Beach Jewish Federation. He was Chairman of the Young Men's Division of the UJA and was actively involved in the Jewish Federation of Metro West NJ as both a volunteer and board member. Martin Brody did so much for so many. A man of honor, he had an extraordinary work ethic, integrity and personal warmth. In a world of change, no one who worked for him ever quit. A longtime resident of Short Hills, NJ, he lived in Boca Raton, FL. Mr. Brody is survived by his beloved wife and lifetime partner, Florence, brother Arthur, sister Marion, daughter and son-in-law Renee and Alan Levow, son and daughter-in-law Marc and Carleen Brody. His three grandchildren Jake Levow, Cary Levow and Justine Brody were the light of his life from the day they were born. He was fond of saying ""life is not a dress rehearsal"" and he lived his life with that quote in mind. Martin Brody devoted most of his life to serving his community, his country and his family. We are all better for having known him and he will be deeply missed."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"I took my 10-year-old niece and my 8-year-old nephew to see ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' and they were neither bored nor particularly excited by the film, though both professed to have really enjoyed it when queried afterward. They couldn't articulate it all that well, but they had certainly found a connection with the movie, possibly because, like many children, they basically live on that island all the time, in the company of adults who are variously playful, loving, angry, moody, absent, funny, sad and scary; and all these modes are totally unpredictable and frequently unexplainable. -- Caelum Vatnsdal of Winnipeg, Manitoba, in response to A.

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"JACOBY--Gaby Monet, October 31, 2009, passed away peacefully after a long illness, surrounded by family and friends that adored her. Gaby was the beloved wife of legendary comedy writer, Coleman Jacoby, for over fifty-four years and magnificent stepmother to Catherine and Antoinette Jacoby. Nee, Marilyn Lagoria in Oakland California, Gaby became a flamenco dancer as a young girl, and came to New York City at age 19. Gaby danced on Broadway in ""By the Beautiful Sea"" in 1954 and in ""Mask and Gown"" in 1956. She went on to become a choreographer of live industrial musical shows, as a partner in production company Concepts Unlimited Inc. Concepts produced the documentary film, ""Norman Rockwell's World: An American Dream"" winning the Academy Award for Best Short Subject Film in 1971. In addition, Gaby produced and wrote many other successful documentary films for television garnering several Emmy awards and critical acclaim. Gaby had two passions: her love of her family and her love of her work. After forming Jacoby-Monet Productions with Coleman, Gaby began a new chapter in her ever developing career, writing and producing for HBO documentaries, including the highly successful ""Autopsy"" series with medical examiner Michael Baden. Working closely for the last several years with friend and colleague, Sheila Nevins, President of HBO Documentary Films, Gaby additionally produced ""The Iceman Interviews"" and ""The Iceman and the Psychiatrist"". Gaby was known and loved for her kindness, generosity, humility and strong, quiet convictions. In 1963 Gaby marched on Washington with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and was pleased to live to see Barack Obama elected President. Despite her illness, she continued working on the HBO documentary about the Barnes art collection, currently in production. Gaby is survived by her husband Coleman Jacoby, her stepdaughter Loria Parker and husband Gerry Janssen, brother, Jack Lagoria of San Francisco, niece Kitty Dorazi, grandniece Cynthia Dorazi and grandnephews. A memorial in her honor is planned at HBO on Tuesday, December 1st at 10am. Please RSVP at HBO, 212-512-7261 if planning to attend."

''So I thought to myself, I should open a bakery,'' he said, a smudge of flour on his face. ''Or at least a temporary one.'' And for three Sundays this month, he is doing just that -- baking birthday cakes, pear frangipani tarts and an assortment of macarons (he learned from the chief pâtissier at Ladurée, Philippe Andrieu) in the back of Partners & Spade. Everything is for sale (the macarons are $2.50 each; an apple caramel cake, $7) and intended for eating, rather than admiring. ''The real art is indulging in them,'' noted Mr. Cotton (above).

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"Every generation has the cross-country rivalry it deserves. The early 1960s had Packers-Colts, a battle of hard-hitting teams with clean-cut-but-fiery quarterbacks representing rugged shipping towns. The early 1990s had Cowboys-49ers, a booming new economy feud pitting petrodollar-fueled bluster against Silicon Valley efficiency. The current generation gets Patriots-Colts, an Internet-ready morality tale of contrasting personalities: Peyton Manning's aw-shucks drawl and the Colts' P.T.A. picnic reputation versus the tabloid pinup Tom Brady and the shadowy Svengali Bill Belichick. The baggage rarely overwhelms the game: the American Football Conference usually hangs in the balance when these teams meet, and the close final scores (18-15, 27-20, and 24-21 in recent years) do not do justice to how dramatic the games typically are."

Polls found a slim majority in favor of Wall Street bailouts to save the economy. They would listen, watch, wait. By this fall, the majority were not only against the bailouts, but in favor of curbing pay on Wall Street, and tightening government regulation of same. The continuous drip of perceived unfairness continues. One day it's news that Goldman Sachs seems to have stepped ahead of the line of those waiting to receive H1N1 vaccines: why were investment bankers getting doses rather than children or pregnant women? This week, Gallup found one in five parents saying they were unable to get swine flu vaccine for their children."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"KOZAK--Lillian, passed away peacefully in her home on November 11, 2009. An ardent leader in the fight for women's rights, as well as a professional accountant and auditor in the Nassau County Attorney's Office, Family Court Bureau from 1977-2002, Lillian was appointed Chair of The National Organization for Women-New York State Domestic Relations Task Force in 1975. Professional surveys show that the number one reason women contact NOW is for issues related to divorce. Lillian and the core of women she attracted to work with the NOW Task Force were fierce in their determination to end the impoverishment of women and their families once they went through the legal process of divorce. Her background as an accountant gave her the professional skills to monitor such technical issues as laws covering joint bank accounts, the hidden drawbacks in equitable division of property and poorly drafted divorce mediation agreements. Early on, she warned that alternate dispute resolution programs could put women at a disadvantage economically or in cases of child custody and support. Lillian advocated not only for making domestic violence an element in any court evaluation about the ""best interests of the child"" but also for ending practices that resulted in fraudulent statements about assets. Lillian was a recipient of the Susan B. Anthony award of The National Organization for Women-New York State, The National NOW Woman to Woman Award, the Long Island NOW Lifetime Achievement Award, and recently, The Award for Lifetime Service from the Coalition for Family Justice. Lillian was deeply loved by her family. Her generosity was without bounds. She is survived by her daughter Ellen Kozak and her son-in-law, Scott Miller of New York City. Her son Jeffrey Kozak is deceased. A memorial service will be announced."

He was 56 years old. Fred was one of the Nation's most noted and prolific scholars on matters of the law profession's ethics, focusing on diverse issues such as prosecutorial ethics, attorney-client confidentiality, ethics code drafting, judicial regulation of lawyers, and the role of advocates in the American legal system. He believed that lawyers have ethical roles beyond their duty to advance their clients' interests, that, in addition, they have countervailing obligations to the courts, the legal system, third parties, society as a whole, and general morality. Fred was a graduate of the Ethical Culture and Fieldston Schools, Johns Hopkins University and Yale Law School; before becoming a Law Professor at Cornell in 1983, he served as a public interest lawyer in Washington, DC. He moved to the University of San Diego in 1990. He was a member of the American Law Institute, a former chair of the AALS Section of Professional Responsibility and the Section on Scholarship, and has been an active member of various organizations relating to lawyers' professional ethics. His philanthropic work included support for the San Diego Shelter for Homeless Teenagers (SDYCA) and as a long-term advisor to the Legal Ethics Committee of the San Diego County Bar. Fred is survived by his loving wife, Sharon Soroko Zacharias, sons Blake and Eric, mother Laure, and brother Lawrence, brother-in-law Richard Soroko, sisters-in-law Cathy Schoen and Sherry Schoenberg, a nephew Josh and a niece Alix. He will be remembered above all as a warm, loving and humorous family man, a cherished colleague, a loyal and generous friend, and a man of the highest principles."

2009-11-15T00:00:00Z,"EDISON--Sidney J.,died peacefully at home on October 29, at age 94. Known affectionately to his intimates as ""Palmer,"" he was a much loved and admired brother, cousin, mentor, friend, enjoyed for his whimsy, protean knowledge, ironic wit, modest authority and supportive generosity. Born in Atlanta, raised in St. Louis, a one-time resident of California and a sometime resident of Venice, Italy and Paris, he was at heart a New Yorker, and attended the theatre two or three nights a week, well into his later years. After attending the University of Wisconsin, Sidney spent a year painting in Paris. A man of high critical standards, no less when measuring his own talents, he returned to the US and settled in New York, where he was hired by Lincoln Kirstein as the first director of the MOMA Dance Archive, later to become the foundation for the Dance Collection at the New York Public Library. The 40s proved a personally eventful decade, in which he met and married the late Evelyn Brookman (the marriage ended but a friendship endured), studied painting and sculpture at the New York's Art Students' League, taught ballroom dancing at the Arthur Murray Dance Studios and extended his cultural interests in music and writing, counting among his early friends Virgil Thompson and Tennessee Williams. He moved to Los Angeles and focused on his writing skills. There he found work on films being produced to support the war effort. In 1972, through his mother's friendship with an early-grade school teacher in the UK, he encountered a child whose insatiable intellectual curiosity matched his own; he became a quiet benefactor of both the young man's cultural expansion and his continuing education, on through Oxford. Of Sidney, his protege, now a professor, has said, ""It's so terribly sad to lose someone who had been such an important, inspirational and transforming figure in one's life."" Sidney Edison was the son of Hannah Farbstein Edison and Harry Edison. His father founded Edison Brothers Stores, an enterprise in which he was joined by his four younger brothers. It began as a single shoe store in Atlanta and grew nationally to become the largest chain of women's shoe stores in the country. As the business grew, the family moved to St. Louis, home of the Company's corporate headquarters. Sidney was predeceased by his sister Edna. He is already missed and will be remembered and quoted often by multiple generations of his close and loving family, as well as friends and acquaintances, whom he treated with equal respect. At his request, no memorial service is planned."

2009-11-16T00:00:00Z,"What everyone has suspected for weeks has now been made more or less official by President Obama and other world leaders: no new legally binding climate treaty will emerge at discussions in Copenhagen next month. The continuing differences between industrialized and developing nations over who should bear the burden of stopping global warming mean that at best Copenhagen will be a steppingstone. This does not make the talks between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China any less important. Even an interim agreement will be impossible without enthusiastic participation by both countries, which together account for 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, has sketched the outlines of a fallback position that would have all countries commit to achievable, transparent domestic targets while negotiations on a broader treaty continued. This is an honorable proposition that Mr. Obama can easily accept, but getting Mr. Hu to sign on -- and bring other developing countries with him -- may take some doing."

''Ultraviolet,'' her much-delayed first album, aims to be a constant stream of enlightened fun. This is a record girls can share with their parents, and possibly even their boyfriends.

Under Mr. Eckel's leadership, Copano grew from a single 23-mile pipeline to a successful midstream natural gas company with over 6,000 miles of pipeline and seven processing plants in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Louisiana. Mr. Eckel was also an industry innovator, as evidenced by the fact that Copano was the first midstream company to trade publicly as a limited liability company. Mr. Eckel conducted his life and his business affairs with the highest level of integrity. He had a tremendous work ethic and was a compassionate leader. His influence in the oil and gas sector is also reflected in his work at the Texas Pipeline Association, where he served on the Board and on the Executive Committee, and at Live Oak Reserves, Inc., an exploration and production company that he founded in 1986. Following graduation from Columbia University in 1973, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, Mr. Eckel joined the Securities Investment Department of The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York as an Investment Analyst and subsequently served as an Assistant Director of Investments (Energy and Minerals). In 1977, Mr. Eckel joined Lehman Brothers as an Associate in Corporate Finance and in 1978, was elected Assistant Vice President in Energy Finance. After leaving the finance sector, Mr. Eckel became involved in the energy industry, founding drilling, service and exploration and production companies before founding Copano. Mr. Eckel was known for his support of a broad range of charitable organizations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Elton John AIDS Foundation and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Physician Scientist Program Fund) and for fostering in others his ethic of purposeful giving. Mr. Eckel was a member of the Director's Counsel at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Eckel also served as a member of the Director's Circle and on the American Painting and Sculpture subcommittee for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Mr. Eckel is preceded in death by his mother Margaret Fultz Eckel, grandparents O.B. and Marguerite Fultz and John Glenn and Florence Eckel. Mr. Eckel's interest in oil and gas was fostered by both of his grandfathers' involvement in the oil and gas business in Texas. Mr. Eckel is survived by his father, John R. Eckel, Sr., his brother David Eckel and wife, Sandra, his sister Anne Lowery and husband Greg and his niece Sarah Lowery. Details of a memorial service are pending. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to make a donation in Mr. Eckel's honor should direct it to the Whitney Museum of American Art or the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (American Painting and Sculpture)."

He was delivered to the Lord peacefully, at his home, under the light of a full moon and a clear sky. John was born in 1918 in Rochester, NY, the only child of George S. and Dorothy M. Armstrong. Raised in Riverside, CT, he attended Riverside School, Brunswick School and Deerfield Academy. He graduated from Williams College and New York University. After a brief period of employment with Dupont, John went on to work with his father's firm, the George S. Armstrong Company, in New York City. He worked there as a consulting engineer until his retirement as president of the company in 1995. John married Helga Evensen in 1950 and, until her untimely death in 1974, raised their three daughters together. His unfailing and absolute devotion to his children and their wellbeing stirred his spirit until his last breath. He was married to Mary Helen Post Hurlimann from 1977 until 2001. While he held her three daughters, Mary Ann, Lily and Sandy, in the highest regard and with much affection, Sandy held a piece of his heart. Aside from the pride he took in his work and the accomplishments of his children and grandchildren, John was deeply proud of his efforts on behalf of the New York University Alumni Federation. He leaves his children: Karin and her husband, Arthur Newhouse of Stowe, Vermont; Christine of Shelburne, Vermont; and Lise of South Burlington, Vermont. Grandchildren, Bart and wife, Amy, Kirsten and husband, Ben, Matthew, Anna Christina, Brendan, Christian and Lille, and great grandsons, Chace and Liam, cherish his memory. Private services were held on November 7, 2009 at the Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, CT. A Memorial Service will be held next summer (2010) in Greensboro, VT, John's lifelong and beloved summer home. Although John appreciated flowers, and loved both a woman who grew them and a woman who painted them, instead of flowers, he preferred that any memorials in his name be made to the John C. Armstrong Scholarship Fund at the New York University Alumni Federation, c/o Alan Shapiro, Director of Gift Planning, 25 W. 4th Street, 4th fl., NYC, NY 10012. (212.998.6960)."

Mr. Eckel was born October 22, 1951 in Houston, Texas. Mr. Eckel founded Copano Energy in 1992 and served as President and Chief Executive Officer until April 2003, when he became Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. Eckel's leadership, Copano grew from a single 23-mile pipeline to a successful midstream natural gas company with over 6,000 miles of pipeline and seven processing plants in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming and Louisiana. Mr. Eckel was also an industry innovator, as evidenced by the fact that Copano was the first midstream company to trade publicly as a limited liability company. Mr. Eckel conducted his life and his business affairs with the highest level of integrity. He had a tremendous work ethic and was a compassionate leader. His influence in the oil and gas sector is also reflected in his work at the Texas Pipeline Association, where he served on the Board and on the Executive Committee, and at Live Oak Reserves, Inc., an exploration and production company that he founded in 1986. Following graduation from Columbia University in 1973, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, Mr. Eckel joined the Securities Investment Department of The Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York as an Investment Analyst and subsequently served as an Assistant Director of Investments (Energy and Minerals). In 1977, Mr. Eckel joined Lehman Brothers as an Associate in Corporate Finance and in 1978, was elected Assistant Vice President in Energy Finance. After leaving the finance sector, Mr. Eckel became involved in the energy industry, founding drilling, service and exploration and production companies before founding Copano. Mr. Eckel was known for his support of a broad range of charitable organizations including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Elton John AIDS Foundation and MD Anderson Cancer Center (Physician Scientist Program Fund) and for fostering in others his ethic of purposeful giving. Mr. Eckel was a member of the Director's Counsel at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Eckel also served as a member of the Director's Circle and on the American Painting and Sculpture subcommittee for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Mr. Eckel is preceded in death by his mother Margaret Fultz Eckel, grandparents O.B. and Marguerite Fultz and John Glenn and Florence Eckel. Mr. Eckel's interest in oil and gas was fostered by both of his grandfathers' involvement in the oil and gas business in Texas. Mr. Eckel is survived by his father, John R. Eckel, Sr., his brother David Eckel and wife, Sandra, his sister Anne Lowery and husband Greg and his niece Sarah Lowery. Details of a memorial service are pending. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to make a donation in Mr. Eckel's honor should direct it to the Whitney Museum of American Art or the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (American Painting and Sculpture)."

2009-11-17T00:00:00Z,"Jay-Z, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have signed on as producers of the new Broadway musical ''Fela!,'' right, and will attend the show's opening night at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Monday, a publicist for the production said. Their artistic involvement is bound to be minimal, given that the show is already in previews and had a critically acclaimed run Off Broadway last year. But the presence of three high-wattage celebrities at opening night, and the likelihood that they will promote the show through television appearances and media interviews, will raise the show's public profile at a time when theatergoers have plenty of Broadway musicals to choose from. Conceived by the Tony Award-winning choreographer Bill T. Jones, ''Fela!'' centers on the life and work of the Afro-beat superstar Fela Anikulapo Kuti. There are no big stars in the cast, which makes the involvement of Jay-Z and the Smiths even more of a marketing boon.

2009-11-18T18:59:12Z,"First, a correction. The concluding point in my earlier post is wrong: The House health care bill would not, in fact, effectively tax all 18 million of the remaining uninsured to pay for coverage for the other 36 million, because some percentage of that 18 million - in the draft of the Senate bill, it's anyone who couldn't find a health care plan costing less than 8 percent of income; in the House bill it's still unspecified - would be eligible for a ""hardship waiver"" exempting them from paying the fine if they can't afford coverage.

Tired yet? The bleary-eyed emerged the next day to make it to the Jeff Koons private reception and brunch at Gagosian before heading back to their hotels to get their glad rags on for MOCA's 30th anniversary gala. Over 1,000 guests - everyone from John Baldessari to Brangelina and Gore Vidal - turned out for the black-tie-soiree-as-performance-art, which raised over $4 million for the resurgent museum.

A rabbit's ears, for instance, are reduced to their antenna-like spring supports, while a formerly cocky rooster drags his now-heavy body around, crowing as if he were still king of the barnyard.

They served as heavy anchors to the slender suits of the day that have been resurfacing thanks to ""Mad Men"" and the spinoffs hitting the floors at Brooks Brothers, J. Crew and Banana Republic. Duckie Brown's brogue collaboration with Florsheim has reinvigorated its classic Royal Imperial collection with saturated colors and artful perforations; other stateside manufacturers like Alden and Allen Edmonds have classic versions of the shoe that originated in England with brands like Trickers, Church's and Grenson. I prefer the cordovan color for the rich tone it adds to any gray suit, but black will do just fine. Best of all, brogues are not just suited for business - they are the perfect exclamation point for jeans, whether they are faded and worn, or dark and unwashed.

In this first entry the mountaineer Peter Athans leads an expedition of climbers, archaeologists, anthropologists and art historians on a mission to rescue valuable Tibetan texts from their deteriorating shelter before looters find them. A confrontation results, involving a political group from a nearby village, the king of Mustang and even the rights of the divinities that are believed to inhabit the area. In ''Lost Cave Temples of the Himalaya,'' at 9, Liesel Clark chronicles the 2007 expedition of Mr. Athans, who is her husband, and the big-wall climber Renan Ozturk as they maneuvered into the crumbling caves, where each vertical move was a step into a lost world unoccupied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. 9:45 A.M.

Kansas City's 16-10 victory on Sunday was its seventh in a row at Oakland Coliseum. Since the Raiders played in the Super Bowl after the 2002 season, they are 3-11 against the Chiefs, a streak that includes losses to forgettable starting quarterbacks like Damon Huard and Tyler Thigpen. The streak is even more galling for Raiders fans when one considers that almost a quarter of Kansas City's 47 wins over the past seven seasons have come against Oakland. In the wake of the latest loss, Oakland Coach Tom Cable is contemplating a quarterback switch, but a change in buildings might be a better idea: the Raiders were much closer to .500 (12-14) against the Chiefs during the 13 years they called Los Angeles home.

2009-11-18T00:00:00Z,"REDLER--Angelika Marta (nee Hausman), of Manhattan, died Monday, November 16, 2009 just short of her 99th birthday. Familiarly known as Aga, she lived a storied life that began in privilege, was torn apart by extreme loss and suffering, and eventually ended in comfort and security. Her life story epitomizes the historic events that befell European Jews during the rise and fall of Nazism. Aga was born in Krakow, then part of Austria Hungary, now Poland, on November 28th 1910, into a well to do and cultured Jewish family. Her father and uncle were the owners of a multi city block shopping complex known as ""Passage Hausman"" in Lwow (Lemberg), Poland, now part of Ukraine. Highly educated, Aga studied art and literature; spoke French, Italian and English as well as Polish and German, which were her native tongues. She married Dr. Irvine Redler in 1934. At the start of the Second World War, Dr. Redler was able to leave the country because he played soccer for a team that represented Poland in an international league. Eventually, Mrs. Redler was also able to escape Poland and was reunited with her husband in Scotland, where both worked in a hospital as members of the Polish Army in exile under the leadership of General Anders. Mrs. Redler's parents and her brother Bruno were unable to leave and were exiled to Siberia by the Russians when the Nazis declared war on Soviet Russia. Mrs. Redler's father and brother, then 18, died in captivity as a result of malnutrition and lack of medical care. Her mother, Alicia Glatzer-Hausman survived the war and was reunited with her daughter and son-in-law in England. The three immigrated to the US in 1947 and made their home in New York City. Dr. Redler was professor of orthopedics at New York University Hospital until his death in 1981. Mrs. Redler worked as a volunteer translator at the hospital and at the Guggenheim Museum for many years. She loved New York, and its cultural events, especially the Opera.

Renowned Rabbinic scholar, he immigrated to New York from Galicia passing through the gates of Ellis Island in 1920. His lengthy career had numerous stopping points and milestones, culminating with a span of 27 years in Montreal, Canada where, in addition to his pulpit position, he served for many years as President of the Board of Jewish Ministers. Following the death of his beloved wife Chiennie, he lived the last 31 years of his life in the community of Hillcrest, Queens. He is survived by his children Soshy and Chaim, their spouses Sol and Marni, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Zeidi was graced with an effusive personality and presence. He was a dynamic orator and legendary teller of tales. He was an integral force in our lives for so long, it is hard to conceive of life without him. Baruch Adoshem yom yom. Blessed be God for every day."

The point, Mary Jo Diehl said, was to give the young a chance to shine under pressure. ''In a dream world you've got six months and a bolt of Italian silk to make a dress,'' she said.

2009-11-19T00:00:00Z,"Revised guidelines from an influential panel of medical experts suggest that women under age 50 forgo annual mammograms. Conservatives were quick to cite the new recommendations as an example of hazardous government intrusion into health care, and many readers agreed. Following are a sampling of comments: Here in a single capsule-sized dose is the reason health care costs are skyrocketing: No one is willing to accept anything short of the Cadillac standard of health care, even when a Ford is perfectly adequate to get you where you want to go. Donnolo Their agenda at the outset was one of cost-cutting, making more money for the insurance companies in the short term, and not patient care. They totally ignored a large body of evidence that contradicts their position. Marco77 It's all about cost first, quality second. In this health care debate, you get to pick your poison, but both pills are bitter. Bill My first mammogram, at the age of 40, showed I had ductal carcinoma in situ. Surgery followed. Five years later, I had invasive cancer, a far more aggressive and dangerous disease. It is unthinkable that mammograms should be withheld until the age of 50. It is also unforgivable that a remote task force could propose such a disturbing and alarming suggestion. cjm What about screening for prostate cancer? Oh, of course, men are better able to deal with the trauma of false positives. Fragile women must be shielded from this awful fate, even at the risk of their lives. Silly me. Robinson"

It will almost certainly lose the race after the season ends and Fox's ''American Idol'' returns to the air in January. Through 10 weeks, ''Sunday Night'' viewership (19.8 million), household rating (12.0) and all key demographic ratings placed it at No. 1. The numbers are slightly less dominating for the TV season, which began on Sept. 21 and excluded NBC's first three games.

2009-11-20T19:19:14Z,"It's late in the season, but you would not be able to tell by looking at the schedule. Top-ranked Florida is taking on Florida International, No. 2 Alabama plays Chattanooga and no top 25 teams play each other. It seems like a lineup fit for the first or second week. But even in this seeming desert of decent games, there are a few matchups worth watching. Two of them -- Oregon at Arizona and California at Stanford -- are in the wide-open Pac-10, which has defied expectations throughout the season. Mississippi State at Arkansas may not mean much in the larger context of the SEC, but it does give two programs which seem to be improving under relatively new coaches a chance to show where they stand. Kansas State's game against Nebraska does matter in the Big 12, though the prize for winning this game will be a date with powerful Texas in the conference title game. And to round things out and keep the A.C.C. fans interested, we'll be keeping an eye on North Carolina and Boston College. Our band of prognosticators have made their picks, and now it's time to hear from you. If you agree, disagree or merely find the predictions laughable, feel free to chime in with a comment."

When Mr. McCartney visited his home around the time of the Grammy Awards, Mr. Starr said, ""I played him this other track and Paul said: 'Give me the headphones. Give me a pair of cans.' And he went to the mike, and he just invented that part where he follows on my vocal. That was all Paul McCartney, and there could be nothing better."" The song was written by Van Dyke Parks and Mr. Starr, who added that Mr. McCartney's contribution ""makes the song like a conversation between us, and that was Paul's idea to do his part one beat behind me.""

They would also require certain residential building owners to add parking if they modify their buildings. These changes are ""key to fostering inviting, walkable blocks,"" the city planning commissioner, Amanda M. Burden, said when she announced the proposed new rules on Monday. Like the PlaNYC and other recent Bloomberg administration initiatives, the rules hold the potential for making the city more pedestrian friendly and create more green spaces.

In a statement to The Tennessean, Gibson said that it was ""fully cooperating with agents of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as it pertains to an issue with harvested wood."" The Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group, said the Gibson chief executive, Henry Juszkiewicz, would not rejoin its board until the federal investigation ends."

Other times, he just freestyle-raps (“to the break of dawn!”). “What may seem like random, dissociated bursts of energy are in fact the brilliant syncopations of a player with a sure, if unorthodox, sense of rhythm,” Scott writes. Ditto for the movie itself. “It has a warped sincerity, and an energy that keeps going and going. To the break of dawn!”"

2009-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Seeking justice and a spot in the World Cup for its national team, the Football Association of Ireland has demanded a replay of the playoff game that ended in France's favor after Thierry Henry handled the ball before passing to William Gallas for a score. The teams played to a 1-1 draw Wednesday, but France advanced to next year's World Cup in South Africa, 2-1, on total goals in the two-game playoff. ''The blatantly incorrect decision by the referee to award the goal has damaged the integrity of the sport,'' the association said in a statement. ''We now call on FIFA, as the world governing body for our sport, to organize for this match to be replayed.''"

2009-11-20T00:00:00Z,"When Stuart Kipnis, a 45-year-old Lincoln Square father, decided to become the primary caregiver for his infant son, Liam, both above, he expected to face the usual parenting challenges, like Muppet overload and a marked lack of intelligible conversation. But Mr. Kipnis never dreamed he would be rejected by a play group because he was a father. It all started when Mr. Kipnis, a genial personal trainer, spotted a flier for Little Lincoln Logs, a local play group intended for parents with children from newborns to age 5. He sent an e-mail message, figuring he fit both criteria. The response: Not so fast. Apparently in this case ''parents'' meant ''mothers'' -- several of whom were not thrilled by the idea of a strange man coming to their homes for group-sponsored play dates."

He was 85 years of age. Mr. Ragsdale was a resident of New York City for 58 years and spent summers in Mattapoisett, MA for 47 years. Known as Rags, he was born in Baker City, Oregon and attended schools there. During World War II, he attended the University of Colorado in the Naval V12 program and upon graduation he served on the William B. Langfitt troop transport in the Pacific. After the service he attended the Harvard Business School on an academic scholarship and graduated in 1951. Rags' first venture into advertising was in the advertising department of Paramount Pictures in 1951 researching the impact - if any - that the newly developed television might have upon the movie industry. He went on to Compton Advertising, now Satchi & Satchi, where he helped to launch Gleem Toothpaste ""for people who can't brush after every meal"". His next position was at William Esty. Once at Ted Bates Worldwide, Rags was instrumental in bringing William Esty into the Ted Bates Worldwide Organization. He is a past member of the new York Athletic Club, The Harvard Club of New York, and the American Advertising Federation. He was appreciated for giving full credit to those who worked with him for their contributions to advertising campaigns. He was also known for a wonderful sense of humor. His coworkers refer to the period of time that they worked with him as their ""Camelot"". He is survived by Mimi his loving wife for 57 years and dear daughter Martha, his niece Dana and nephews Richard and Norman. He was preceded in death by his brothers Lee, Norman and Orville.

2009-11-20T00:00:00Z,"Tim Burton's career is the ultimate revenge of the art nerd. Mr. Burton, the self-professed alienated child of a dysfunctional family in Burbank, Calif., who funneled his loneliness, pain and grief into drawing cartoons, has found fame, fortune and a beautiful companion (Helena Bonham Carter) by telling cinematic tales of sensitive misfits triumphing over, or succumbing to, a world of repressive mediocrity. His recurring theme has near-universal resonance. Who has not dreamed of proving that he or she was underestimated by the forces of ignorance and venality? But it is Mr. Burton's extraordinarily inventive and adventurous way with the languages of popular film that accounts mainly for his success. Without the confectionery beauty and technical ingenuity of his movies -- and performances by charismatic actors like Paul Reubens, Michael Keaton and Johnny Depp in films as diverse as ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' ''Beetlejuice'' and ''Sweeney Todd'' -- his Oedipal pathos would not be enough."

2009-11-21T12:32:33Z,"Re ""The Archbishop's Blog"" (Nov. 8):The explanation for The Times's refusal to publish Archbishop Timothy Dolan's letter is lame and defensive, as is the rest of your column. Your argument seems to be that because The Times gave the archbishop a lot of coverage and said some nice things about him when he first came to New York that it can with impunity publish imbalanced and biased articles about the Catholic Church.Likewise, you seem to argue that because some of the religion writers for The Times sometimes write articles that are not considered offensive, this makes the offensive ones O.K. With respect to Maureen Dowd, it's difficult to see how The Times sponsors her vitriolic diatribes in general. Her work is short on reason and logic but long on venom and distortion, hardly a contribution to serious public discussion. It's no secret that The Times is steadily losing readership. Remaining in denial about its skewed coverage of the Catholic Church is just the latest example of how badly out of touch with reality the editors and writers for The Times continue to be. I suspect many will find your attempt to defend The Times's record on this matter to be thoroughly unpersuasive.MSGR. MICHAEL FITZGERALDPhiladelphia, Nov. 8, 2009 ●I write as a Catholic nun who is a daily reader of The Times, and I agree with your conclusion that The Times does not have a pattern of anti-Catholicism. Maureen Dowd's column on nuns and the Vatican was compatible with my ""anger and anguish about the moral crisis"" in the church. If any group in the U.S. Catholic Church should be investigated, it is the bishops who presided over the pattern of moving ""troubled"" priests from parish to parish without disclosure - to parishioners or legal authorities - of actions that potentially constituted sexual abuse and required investigation. In January 2006, The Times wrote an editorial praising a Detroit auxiliary bishop, Thomas Gumbleton, for his advocacy of improved public policies to deal with sexual abuse by priests and others. Subsequent to the publication of this editorial, local church leaders remarked that the supportive editorial was proof that The Times had an anti-Catholic bias. This reactionary critique causes me to infer that the accusation of anti-Catholic bias on the part of The Times is an example of the Catholic Church's being defensive and protective of itself, not an objective assessment of the attitude of the newspaper. SISTER SUE SATTLER, I.H.M.Detroit, Nov. 8, 2009 ●The New York Times has no sympathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and, in fact, is institutionally predisposed to find fault with the church wherever and whenever it may be found.The Times does not value churchgoing Roman Catholics as part of its constituency; as a result, we are fair game. The core audience of The Times -- secularists, atheists, members of certain politically left-leaning Christian and non-Christian denominations, all enjoy it immensely when The Times uses its pages to kick the church. Archbishop Dolan is correct -- other faiths (and, I might add, certain other favored segments of society) -- get a ""bye"" from the writers and editors of The Times. Who knows? Maybe the Times and its Catholic-baiting political and cultural allies will eventually hound us into shutting down our charities, closing our hospitals, ending our school system and walking away from our colleges. But life in New York and this nation would be much poorer for it.THOMAS J. RICE Manhattan, Nov. 10, 2009 ● I see nothing in Archbishop Dolan's screed that claims the facts of the reporting were wrong. He's just upset that the wrongs were reported. It is asked: ""What is fair to report and criticize about the leadership of a religion?"" Everything is fair to be reported - the good, the bad, and the ugly, as long as the reporting is accurate. Dolan says that Dowd dug ""deep into the nativist handbook to use every anti-Catholic caricature possible."" Virtually every Catholic in the country opposed the nativist anti-Catholic assault of the 19th century, but today's Catholics, on the other hand, support and praise the secular press coverage of the crimes and cover-up of the crimes of Catholic clergy - coverage that is almost totally absent in the Catholic press. Nothing is being reported today that the clergy has not brought on itself. For centuries the Catholic clergy has impressed on the laity the image of a clergy so superior that there slowly emerged the perception of a real ontological difference between the two. Accurate reporting in the secular press about sexual abuse, larcenous pastors stealing millions from their parishes, and now a Vatican investigation of our nuns is rightly tearing down this myth. B.M. BYRNEVienna, Va., Nov. 9, 2009 ● It is not surprising to me that the Catholic archbishop would see anti-Catholicism in the article by Maureen Dowd, coverage of the pedophilia scandal and other stories that didn't reflect well on Catholics or the Catholic Church. The church is and always has been an authoritarian hierarchy. As such, it is able to prohibit dissent or criticism from members of its hierarchy and, to a great degree, members of its congregations. It is reasonable for an archbishop to conclude that if he can't criticize, no one else should be allowed to either.In a secular, liberal democratic state, the cherished right of freedom of speech includes the right to criticize anybody and everybody. I hope these values persist for a long time to come. I have little hope that religions that depend on blind obedience will embrace them anytime soon.STEPHEN JONESVenice, Fla., Nov. 10, 2009 ● I'm an 84-year-old Catholic who has been reading The Times since I was 17. I cannot agree with Archbishop Dolan's outrage over Maureen Dowd's column on the attitude of the church toward nuns. Women are just as intelligent and responsible as men. Many of them occupy the top positions in American business and serve in growing numbers in both houses of Congress as well as presidential cabinets. Indeed, one female recently almost achieved the office of president. What's next - ordained female priests?TERRY ROEWarminster, Pa., Nov. 9, 2009 ● ● Re ""Recession, Revolution and a Leaner Times"" (Nov. 1):Doubtless the decision about charging online readers is an important one, but seldom are important business decisions arrived at by following a clear consensus. More often, when one finds a clear business consensus, it is often proved wrong and/or late, like American auto companies' decision to play down smaller, fuel-efficient cars. No, this is a tough decision that will accurately be made by leadership choosing a path or paths that may appear questionable at the outset, but may be recognized as visionary later.GARY SWAYZEManchester, Mass., Nov. 1, 2009 ●Come on, throw us a bone here - give those of us who care about The New York Times an opportunity to support it. How about a ""We Love the NYT"" coffee mug, an ""All the News That's Fit to Print"" umbrella, an ""Honorary Times Cub Reporter"" T-shirt, a ""Members Only"" spot on the Web site - you name it, we'll probably donate to get it.Like many Times supporters, my home page is The New York Times, and I read it (for free) every day. I send articles (for free) to friends and family by e-mail probably once a week. I get the Sunday Times delivered to my Toronto home but I can't justify getting the paper (or any newspaper) every day. But I rely on the kind of reporting that no one but The New York Times is doing, and I'd be willing, even thrilled, to support it in the same way I support Minnesota Public Radio, which I listen to (for free) online.

It was a difficult decision and a hard adjustment; I'd still prefer to handle an actual newspaper, but it made no sense to pay over $800 per year when I can pay $15 per month for the same content. It seems to me that there ought to be something in between. I'd obviously be willing to pay far more than $15 per month.I continue to believe that in the long run, the best model for a news organization will be that of a nonprofit, public-service organization. There will always be a readership, an increasingly small and specialized niche for newspapers, but the old business model will not last. In my opinion, The Times should essentially junk its junky free site and develop more along the polished, clean subscription service represented by Times Reader.DAVID TALLMANAtlanta, Nov. 2, 2009 ●Like other dedicated readers, I am worried. There is so much talk of newsroom cuts and elimination of bureaus and newspaper sections, I open the Sunday Times fearful that some section will be missing, or there will be some subtle change in the quality of the articles. Yesterday I was reminded that change and technological innovation will not necessarily lead to the demise of newspapers. I read The Times using the Times Reader for the first time and I was impressed by how easily I could work my way through in an efficient yet leisurely way - as a Sunday read ought to be. While nytimes.com is useful and a site I'll continue to use, it's very different from the experience of actually reading the (print-version) paper. I tend to jump about, depending on what grabs my attention, and I rarely get through the day's news. And I find pop-up ads irritating. But why is there no advertising in the Times Reader version of the paper? Wouldn't this be a perfect vehicle for print-style ads (NOT pop-ups!!)? The beauty of in-paper advertising is that it is seen, but if it is of no interest the reader can skip over and ignore it. It does not detract from the pleasure of reading the paper. Old-fashioned, perhaps, but effective. Surely there remain some advertisers out there who would see value in placing their messages here.CHERISSE BANDY Foster, R.I., Nov. 2, 2009 ●This morning, like every Sunday morning, I went out to the little coffee shop that charges $1 per cup for any size coffee, and picked up my New York Times. Five dollars for the paper is a lot of money for me at the moment - I am 69 years old, have been unemployed for almost a year, and things are very tight. However, not having the Sunday Times is like giving up a part of my history (I grew up in New York, and along with bagels and lox, The Times is Sunday morning), and giving up on the great tradition of print news. So, I pay my $5, buy cheaper food for the cat (just kidding) and enjoy the luxury of Sunday with the Times.Weekdays I mostly catch you online - and for the past few months I have been wondering why you do not charge at least a nominal fee for this service. I would be happy to pay it (I'll tell the cat to eat cake) if that fee would guarantee that the print version of The Times would stay with us. Our country needs real journalists - those guys that hold the governments feet to the fire and protect our interests. I hope you do go ahead with charging for online service, and I hope again to see reporters playing bridge and working crossword puzzles.SHARON RESNICKPrinceton, N.J., Nov. 1, 2009 ●Why don't you ask for voluntary contributions from online readers? I would be very glad to pay $300 per year. It is wonderful to read the paper here in Edmonton at the same time that someone in New York can. And many of your readers understand well how important investigative journalism is in keeping governments honest.BILL KELLY Edmonton, Alberta, Nov. 1, 2009 ●I am a faithful reader of The New York Times online, but if it were not free, I would not have become so faithful. I used to go to many different sites to get all the news. Now I start at your site and believe it is by far the best in the United States. My recommendation is to allow a one-year free subscription to new users. Then try to keep the yearly charge as low as possible to encourage the widest readership. Like the woman in your column, I have my credit card ready. STEVE MARTIN Seattle, Nov. 1, 2009 ●I encourage the debate on charging for The Times online, which The Wall Street Journal and The Economist are doing. But I have a problem if a subscription Web presence will still involve cookies and the related spying on my Web activity. I have debated this with people at The Times and The Economist.The Times suggests that the cookies make the Web ""easier to use."" But there is nothing in the cookies I found that improves my Web experience; many of them are tracking cookies that allow someone to build a marketable profile of me.The argument in your column is that millions of online advertising dollars are at stake if charging for access reduces the number of viewers. That may be, but the advertisers should be aware that many Web users, like myself, do not allow cookies and work diligently to avoid any tracking. And a growing number of Web users are learning about tracking and how to block the intrusion into personal privacy.The decision to charge or not is, in my view, a decision on the long-term survival of The Times. I am concerned that in time the loss of print revenue will force the online version to support more and more of the paper's operations. My larger concern is that the work of powerful newspapers - in keeping our governments and corporations in line with investigative reporting - will disappear without a decent revenue stream to pay the costs of such reporting. So I am willing to pay for access to a robust online New York Times, but I am not willing to surrender my privacy to get it.RAYMOND C. GRAYEaston, Pa., Nov. 1, 2009 ● ●Re ""About That Bloomberg Runaway"" (Nov. 15): Your column suggests the correct and inescapable point that polls can serve as self-fulfilling prophecies, discouraging those who would otherwise vote if the polls were more promising for their candidates. The important point left out, however, is that pollsters should ask directly regarding the intensity of support for candidates, rather than relying on whether respondents may ""change their minds."" That is a good question, but it is no substitute for also inquiring about how strongly poll respondents support specific candidates. If all polls asked about both the strength of support and the likelihood of voters' changing their minds, fewer large disparities between poll support and election support would occur.RICHARD E.

2009-11-21T09:25:30Z,"I have an essay in the NY Times Sunday Book Review about fighting poverty and some of the literature that has arisen. Nobody fights like humanitarians, so there have been battles among the Jeff Sachs camp on the one hand and the Bill Easterly/Dambisa Moyo camp on the other. My take is that the critics have some valid points -- money often is wasted, projects fail, and helping people is far harder than it looks -- but that we're also getting better at figuring out what interventions work, and more money definitely is useful for those. I love the work of the Poverty Action Lab at MIT in bringing rigorous evaluation to development, and I think that also helps in figuring out how to get the most bang for the buck. In any case, read the essay and post any comments here."

Set in the mid-1960s as Mr. Ali, formerly Cassius Clay, began cementing his heavyweight champion status, “Fetch Clay, Make Man,” by Will Power, centers on the young boxer’s friendship with Stepin Fetchit, the stage name of the actor Lincoln Perry. The play deals with creating personas, a point of controversy for Mr. Perry, who, as Fetchit, came across as a lazy and foolish black man — an image that proved lucrative for him. Mr. Parke has been cast as Mr. Ali and Mr. Vereen as Fetchit in the production, which is scheduled to begin performances on Jan. 8, and to open on Jan. 15 and run through Feb. 14. The Tony Award-winning director Des McAnuff (“Jersey Boys,” “700 Sundays”) is to direct.

2009-11-21T00:00:00Z,"“Enter Laughing,” the semiautobiographical novel by Carl Reiner about a funny young actor juggling his girlfriends, career dreams and difficult parents, was turned into a play that was a hit on Broadway in the mid-1960s, and then a musical that flopped in 1976 with the title, “So Long, 174th Street.” That musical was renamed with the original Reiner title and revived Off Broadway by the York Theater Company last season, earning strong reviews and warm endorsements from the likes of Jerry Seinfeld. Now the producer Dan Whitten plans to transfer the York show to Broadway during the 2010-11 season, according to an e-mail message he recently sent to investors. A spokesman for Mr. Whitten said that the transfer was about a year off and that no Broadway house had been lined up. The York production was directed by Stuart Ross (“Forever Plaid”) and starred Josh Grisetti, above, who had been on deck to star as Eugene Jerome in a revival of Neil Simon’s “Broadway Bound.” That show was canceled last month because of a weak advance and poor ticket sales for its companion production, “Brighton Beach Memoirs.”."

In fact, they argue, the economy here is so ravaged by growing debts and ruined banks that it could well be following in the steps of Japan's lost decade of the 1990s. The parallels are eerie: Like Japan, Britain enjoyed more than a decade of booming growth, fed by aggressive bank lending and real estate investments. Haunted by the comparison, policy makers have been extra aggressive in using fiscal and monetary levers in hope of preventing the stagnation and banking stasis that plagued Japan for so many years."

(Starz) DOUBT (2008) Meryl Streep, above, plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of a Roman Catholic school in the Bronx who comes to believe that her supervisor, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest in one of their charges -- and may have acted on it -- in John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his stage play. Amy Adams is the younger nun who fuels her suspicions. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said, ''Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, 'Doubt' essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach.'' She added that Mr. Shanley's ''words are good, solid, at times touching'' but ''it's a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the Grand Concourse, was doing.'' Still, of the role that earned Ms. Streep yet another Oscar nomination, Ms. Dargis wrote, ''She's a hoot, but she's also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church.'' 10:30 A.M.

And it's not completely inappropriate. She was able to colonize cultural territory the way Alexander was able to colonize physical territory.'' Ms. Winfrey announced that her TV talk show would end in September 2011. She will now focus her colonization efforts on a cable channel that will bear her name. Modern-day Thracians beware."
2009-11-22T00:00:00Z,"The Senate debate on health care, set to begin the week after Thanksgiving, is now on course to collide with the holiday season. One question for advocacy groups on all sides will be whether to keep up their barrage of pointed commercials, even as chestnuts roast and stockings are hung. The presidential primary candidates faced this same dilemma two years ago, when the Iowa caucuses were moved up to Jan. 3. The campaigns had to figure out how to stay visible during the crucial weeks before the vote, which overlapped with Christmas and New Year's, when the public was not really up for a political brawl."

2009-11-22T00:00:00Z,"HAVING friends over for dinner used to involve a minimal and fairly unremarkable to-do list: There were groceries to buy, along with flowers and a couple of bottles of semi-respectable wine. I would put out some guest towels and a collection of fancy soaps that were off-limits to blood relatives, and then -- voilà! -- dinner was served. Preparing for a dinner party these days is far more complex, thanks to a vast and bewildering array of dietary needs that seem to have suddenly overtaken everyone I know. An unscientific survey of family and friends turns up one acquaintance who is kosher, two who are more like kosher-style, in addition to two vegans, a smattering of lacto-vegetarians and a couple who cannot digest gluten of any kind. Accommodations must be made for my mother-in-law, who is lactose intolerant, and a friend who is dangerously and inconveniently allergic to peanuts. I must know at least a dozen women who have declared lifelong war on complex carbohydrates. And then there's my daughter, a wispy and tender-hearted flower child who prefers not to eat ''anything with a face'' (although she will sometimes make random and completely unreasonable exceptions for hot dogs and pepperoni)."

Louise Doktor, left center, was recently spotted in amethyst on Park Avenue at 7:40 a.m. An administrative assistant, she has a gift for color and pattern, choosing pieces with no regard for size and wearing them in an uninhibited way: a skirt as a cape; a huge plaid shirt as a shawl."

2009-11-22T00:00:00Z,"EVEN for an artist who trades in the glamorously ephemeral, Francesco Vezzoli created a spectacle -- ''Ballets Russes Italian Style (The Shortest Musical You Will Never See Again)'' -- that was dazzlingly short. The performance featured Lady Gaga, who played her song ''Speechless'' on a rotating pink Steinway grand piano, with butterflies painted by Damien Hirst, all the while flanked by Prada-clad dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet. Conceived for last weekend's 30th anniversary gala at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Mr. Vezzoli's work may have been brief, but that was his intention. ''My work offers a moment of magic that is hard to capture,'' he said. For fans of Mr. Vezzoli's celebrity-obsessed ephemera, he has two exhibitions -- one in Stockholm mixing Dalí's work with his own imagery, starring Princess Caroline of Monaco as Queen Christina; the other, in Paris, an homage to Fellini, starring Eva Mendes as Anita Ekberg. Both run through the middle of January 2010. Fans of Ms. Gaga (above) are now able to buy the Frank Gehry-designed hat she wore that night at moca.org/mocanewauction.

Colorful and graphic, each design depicts a different member of the animal kingdom and reflects its nature, from the solitary owl against its night-sky background to an acid-green snake that seems to slither off the edge of its rug. A pair of butterflies and an adorable school of fish, above, round out the designs, which cost $3,285 or $4,725, depending on size. Barber Osgerby's creations have the playful simplicity of children's-book illustrations, but they're so sophisticated that you'll likely be seeing them in grown-up rooms, too. www.therugcompany.info.

To be honest, I felt ashamed. And a little embarrassed. I had only come to Norway to ski, and maybe write some words about it, not to make a fuss or have makeup put on me in front of little skiing children. But here I was, seated next to a beautiful Norwegian Katie Couric, at the base of a little Hobbit hill, a frozen valley beneath us, a staged cooking fire at my back, unsure of what these people wanted from me.

He is a great teacher of quarterbacks and receivers whose offenses generate impressive statistics, if slightly less impressive point totals. He is a good planner but a poor in-game strategist. As a disciplinarian and motivator, he ranks somewhere between Dick Jauron and a substitute gym teacher. Turner's players must provide their own leadership, and every losing streak sparks questions about the team's character and commitment, as well as Turner's command fitness. The San Diego Chargers (6-3) invariably rally after each losing streak, because they have too much talent to do otherwise. That is why it was foolish to write them off when they started the season 2-3. The Chargers were not a bad team, they were just getting a jump on their disappointment."

Colorful and graphic, each design depicts a different member of the animal kingdom and reflects its nature, from the solitary owl against its night-sky background to an acid-green snake that seems to slither off the edge of its rug. A pair of butterflies and an adorable school of fish, above, round out the designs, which cost $3,285 or $4,725, depending on size.

Some of their neurons respond differently to stress than the neurons of slothful rats. Scientists have known for some time that exercise stimulates the creation of new brain cells (neurons) but not how, precisely, these neurons might be functionally different from other brain cells. In the experiment, preliminary results of which were presented last month at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Chicago, scientists allowed one group of rats to run. Another set of rodents were not allowed to exercise. Then all of the rats swam in cold water, which they don't like to do. Afterward, the scientists examined the animals' brains. They found that the stress of the swimming activated neurons in all of the animals' brains. (The researchers could tell which neurons were activated because the cells expressed specific genes in response to the stress.) But the youngest brain cells in the running rats, the cells that the scientists assumed were created by running, were less likely to express the genes. They generally remained quiet. The ''cells born from running,'' the researchers concluded, appeared to have been ''specifically buffered from exposure to a stressful experience.'' The rats had created, through running, a brain that seemed biochemically, molecularly, calm. For years, both in popular imagination and in scientific circles, it has been a given that exercise enhances mood. But how exercise, a physiological activity, might directly affect mood and anxiety, psychological states, was unclear. Now, thanks in no small part to improved research techniques and a growing understanding of the biochemistry and the genetics of thought itself, scientists are beginning to tease out how exercise remodels the brain, making it more stress-resistant. In work undertaken at the University of Colorado, Boulder, for instance, scientists have examined the role of serotonin, a neurotransmitter often considered to be the ''happy'' brain chemical. That simplistic view of serotonin has been undermined by other researchers, and the University of Colorado work further dilutes the idea. In those experiments, rats taught to feel helpless and anxious (by being exposed to a laboratory stressor) showed increased serotonin activity in their brains. But rats that had run for several weeks before being stressed showed less serotonin activity and were less anxious and helpless despite the stress."

Look at how he felt music, and moved to it. (Especially .10-.20, that davening kind of thing: James Brown did that too.) Listen to the way he chopped up rhythm, sailing his phrases over the beat. You want to say he's imitating a trumpet when he sings, but then you want to say vice versa, so neither can be true.

And by ""sensible policy ideas,"" I don't mean idiosyncratic notions cooked up by a couple of twentysomething journalists working at non-conservative publications; I mean politically plausible ideas being proposed by economists and think tankers with impeccable right-wing bona fides. If the Republicans were associated with, say, Michael Boskin's stimulus ideas, Nicole Gelinas's proposals for handling Wall Street, and some combination of the Miller-Capretta and Troy-Anderson health care plans, they would be a party worth taking seriously on domestic policy. But they aren't, so they aren't. And on this front, the wonks can only do so much: In the end, you need politicians capable of picking up policy ideas and running with them.

But let's be honest: space's heyday was the summer of '69, when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong brought a rugged, clean-cut appeal to the final frontier. It was perhaps with this in mind that Simon Page, a self-taught graphic designer, created a series of posters for the Year of Astronomy that are modeled on textbook covers of the '60s and '70s. The result is a beautiful exercise in conceptual minimalism, with a clear geometric bent that betrays Page's math-nerd origins. (He has a degree in applied mathematics and took up graphic design as a hobby two years ago.) It's hard to choose which to like best, but I'm particularly fond of the deep blue poster, below, in which Page uses diagonal lines to create interstellar objects in relief - and calls to mind the gentle descent of a meteor shower."

Now it is starting an auction process to bring in a market price for a handful of companies' warrants, including JPMorgan's. It's sensible, but the Treasury will probably still be criticized. The government typically took warrants over shares worth 15 percent of the amount of its injection when it invested in banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, received $25 billion from the taxpayer, and the warrants gave the government the right to buy $3.75 billion worth of stock. That right, lasting 10 years, has option value. Determining it, though, has been tricky."

The latter is particularly troublesome because in both the movie and the TV show, some of the main characters were nurses and extras could be found with any job description. The implication was that all this was borderline demeaning to a noble profession and perhaps even sexist. (Constructors are overwhelmingly male.

2009-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Carnage indeed. The new replacement cast of the Broadway hit play “God of Carnage” was off to a slow start at the box office last week, the first performances without the all-star lineup led by James Gandolfini and Marcia Gay Harden, who won the Tony Award for best actress for the production (which itself won best play). This new incarnation of “Carnage” grossed $497,779 last week, compared with $1,107,302 the previous week. The audience attendance last week was only 63 percent of capacity. Still, last week’s gross was among the largest for a play on Broadway (and bigger than grosses for some musicals last week). But by comparison, the play’s former cast had helped catapult “Carnage” into the million-dollar club of top-grossing Broadway shows. The new cast — Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott — has not had the benefit of major new reviews, or anything like the rush of pre-opening media publicity that greeted the original cast. A spokesman for the production, Chris Boneau, said on Monday that the producers had expected the fall-off and noted that the new cast had higher grosses last week than the original “Carnage” cast had in its first full week of previews ($396,470) in March. He added that the producers had a “very healthy advance” in ticket sales and were “more than pleased.”."

The synagogue reopened in 2007 after a 20-year restoration, but there were no available records of the original window. “We decided not to try to recreate something when we did not know what that something really looked like,” said Bonnie Dimun, executive director of the museum. Instead Ms. Smith and Ms. Gans will reimagine the window, due to be completed by spring. While the design has yet to be released, Ms. Smith said it would feature the Star of David at the center “in a field of blue five-pointed stars.”."

And to determine that, the motion continues, they must know when the Ponzi scheme began."

Mr. Medvedev, above, said new laws would not alleviate all the problems the groups faced but would certainly help.

The producers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said Mr. Cohl’s communications were in an initial phase and that Mr. McCollum and Mr. Seller did not have full financial details of the show. They have expertise in mounting large-cast shows (including Mr. McCollum’s new revival of “Ragtime”) and entertainment spectacles like “Avenue Q,” which features puppets. “Spider-Man,” which has had work stoppages this fall because of cash-flow problems that preceded Mr. Cohl, has been conceived as an extravaganza, complete with the S-Man himself swinging above the audience.

Plans by the artist Jeff Koons and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to create an eye-popping piece of public art, a 70-foot replica of a 1943 locomotive engine designed to dangle nose-down from a 161-foot crane — are in limbo because the museum cannot pay for it, Bloomberg reported. The sculpture, estimated at $25 million, shown at right in a model, was expected to be completed in 2011 or 2012 in the museum’s entrance plaza. But the museum said the project had been pushed to 2014-15 because of the damage the economic downturn had done to its finances. Figures recently released show that its investment portfolio lost nearly a quarter of its value during the 2008-9 fiscal year, shrinking to $196 million from $254 million the previous year. Barbara Pflaumer, the museum’s associate vice president for communications and marketing, speaking of Mr. Koons’s engine project, told Bloomberg: “We wouldn’t do it unless someone funds it. Someone has to write us a check.” She added: “This is a very tough economy. Everyone has revised timetables.”."

That's something a little more nuanced for a more delicate and refined palate. I would argue that this weekend of college games is more like the turducken, a complex and multi-layered Russian doll of food, that never fails to surprise with it's confusing flavor juxtapositions and horrific caloric implications."

In a statement, Barbara Ligeti, the show’s lead producer, said, “I am bemused at the image of the cast of ‘Emperor Jones’ sitting in the laps of the company of ‘Made in Heaven’ on that small stage. The (conjoined) twins will love it.” It was unclear whether the show’s contract with the SoHo Playhouse included an out clause that permitted the theater to close the show if its grosses dipped below a certain dollar amount. Representatives for Darren Lee Cole, the plahouse’s general manager, and Ciarán O’Reilly, the producing director of the Irish Rep, said that both men were traveling and could not be reached for comment."

2009-11-26T00:00:00Z,"There has been plenty of blame to go around in the nearly three years since the housing bubble popped. Some fault the homeowners who failed to heed the fine print; some say that the banks, pushing mortgages to unqualified, financially unstable borrowers, deserve the blame. A report published last week by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found that those who lived in predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods were more likely to obtain high-cost subprime loans. Nationally, more than eight million homes have been foreclosed on since the housing boom first gave way to widespread mortgage delinquencies in early 2007; in New York City, at least 15,000 properties have been foreclosed on this year, according to RealtyTrac, which collects foreclosure data.

I went in for a closer look after spotting some camel toggle coats from Gloverall and heavy knit cardigans from the obscure Danish seafaring knitting company SNS Herning. The stand belonged to a brand new online-only men's-wear shop called C'H'C'M', which stands for Clinton Hill Classic Menswear. It was started in March 2009 by Sweetu Patel, a former furniture designer whose selection is skewed heavily toward classic brands like Borsalino, Saint James, Mackintosh and Drakes, as well as other finds like Northern Waters, a Canadian-based knitwear company, and Individualized Shirts. Look for a pop-up shop of its own in January at Audiovisual Arts on First Street in the East Village, where it will break out new spring merchandise.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Swiss officials said on Thursday that they would not challenge a court ruling permitting Roman Polanski to be freed on bail as he fights extradition to the United States to face sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. On Wednesday the Swiss Federal Criminal Court granted Mr. Polanski’s appeal against detention in exchange for $4.5 million, along with other guarantees like the surrender of his identity papers to ensure he does not leave the country. Still, Interpol issued an advisory to its 188 member countries saying that Mr. Polanski should be arrested if he tried to travel. He fled the United States in 1978 before being sentenced. The Justice Ministry had 10 days to submit an appeal to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, but said on Thursday that it had decided not to. The development means that Mr. Polanski may leave his jail cell and remain under house arrest and electronic monitoring at his holiday chalet, above, in Gstaad, a Swiss resort town."

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Sized for coffee tables but more serious than the average book in that category, BURTYNSKY: OIL, the companion to a current show at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington (through Dec. 13), chronicles the Canadian photographer's decade-long look at the fuel industry. Moving from Alberta oil fields to the Talladega Speedway to the ship-breaking yards of Bangladesh, Edward Burtynsky works on a global scale without preaching, and with an eye to sublime landscape paintings. His prints reveal epic waste and irreversible degradation, but carry a whiff of fantasy; the essayist Paul Roth refers to the world therein as ''Petrolia.'' Also worth reading is the down-to-earth travelogue by the Toronto writer Michael Mitchell, who accompanied Mr. Burtynsky to auto shows, tire dumps and bike rallies. (Steidl/Corcoran, $125.)"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"There's a good reason why the three daily book critics for The New York Times don't make 10-best lists at the end of the year: we can't. None of us has read everything. Our reviewing assignments don't overlap. None of us has an objective overview of the year's best and most important books, but this is what we do have: favorites. They are books we have not only admired in the abstract but also enjoyed, recommended and given to friends. The selections on our 10-book lists winnow down a wide array of possibilities. Of the tens of thousands of books published each year, the daily Times reviews only about 250. Each of us chose his or her share of those titles for review. Now Michiko Kakutani, Dwight Garner and I further narrow down those choices, and each of us can tell you which 10 books we'll remember best."

Below are some of the most notable releases of the last few months. Prices given are the manufacturers' suggested retail, which can often be cut in half with a little shopping around."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"TITO RODRíGUEZ EL INOLVIDABLE: A MAN AND HIS MUSIC The recently revived Fania Records has started reaching outside itself, giving new life to the catalogs of artists it never recorded. Here's Tito Rodríguez, a singer and bandleader who lighted up Afro-Latin music from the mid-'40s to the mid-'60s. (At which point he finally lost his drawn-out battle for mambo dominance to Tito Puente, then relocated to his native Puerto Rico and died in 1973.) This exemplary set -- taken from long-out-of-print records made during the '60s -- includes luxe big-band tracks and smaller, more intense conjunto jam sessions, as well as live recordings from the Palladium, the locus of New York's mambo mania. There's also a fascinating 1960 cut called ''Esta Es Mi Orquesta'' -- possibly modeled after an earlier Stan Kenton piece called ''Prologue'' -- in which Rodríguez delivers a spoken lecture in mambo dynamics, introducing musicians one by one, letting them take their licks. (Fania, two discs, $18.98.) BEN RATLIFF"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"JOHN WESLEY. One of the most talked about exhibitions that happened in conjunction with this year's Venice Biennale was an extensive survey of the five-decade career of the painter John Wesley at the Fondazione Prada. The mammoth, 557-page catalog for that show is a visual and informational delight. It includes a profusely illustrated essay by the show's curator, Germano Celant, and a wealth of other textual materials. But the main pleasure is delivered by the hundreds of crisp, color reproductions of Mr. Wesley's oddly comical, formally scrupulous, often erotic, cartoon-style images. Including drawings, studies and source materials relating to many particular paintings, it sheds light on the creative processes of a great American original. (Fondazione Prada, $130.) HEAT WAVES IN A SWAMP: THE PAINTINGS OF CHARLES BURCHFIELD. If you have ever wondered what the world looked like to Ralph Waldo Emerson when he was having an attack of transcendentalist ecstasy, you could do worse than to consult one of the glowing, shimmering landscape paintings that Charles Burchfield produced in the early and late phases of his career. They are among the highlights of a traveling exhibition now at the Hammer Museum and scheduled to open at the Whitney Museum of American Art in June. Surprisingly, that show was organized not by a museum curator but by the sculptor Robert Gober, whose simple, fragmentary notes in this excellent catalog provide an illuminating biographical background to Mr. Burchfield's pantheistic visions. (Hammer Museum and DelMonico Books-Prestel, $49.95.)"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Adrienne Schroeder recently moved to Richmond, Va., from Bozeman, Mont., to care for her aging father. Medical expenses -- not his, but hers -- are a concern. Ms. Schroeder had four pregnancies in the last six years, two ending in miscarriages. She still owes money from those medical costs, despite having had health insurance the whole time."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"The season's liveliest books about antiques cover stolen luxuries, unsung dead designers and the details of detecting fakes. The texts are full of did-you-knows that will no doubt impress your gift recipients or maybe even set off deep discussions about how history's vagaries shape what we own. Since at least the first century collectors have been tricked by forgeries: Pliny wrote about pervasive ''glass counterfeits'' in the gemstone trade, as the Swiss historian Jean-Jacques Fiechter points out in EGYPTIAN FAKES: MASTERPIECES THAT DUPED THE ART WORLD AND THE EXPERTS WHO UNCOVERED THEM (Flammarion, $45). The book is a paranoiac's dream, telling of new carvings that were bathed in acid, boiled in tobacco and rolled in bitumen dust to look and even smell old. Once a scam had been detected -- perhaps because the pharaoh statuette wig looked a little too Art Deco, or the scarab inscriptions had basic grammatical errors -- embarrassed owners sometimes just swept the problem under the rug by quietly selling it off."

Guinness Anchor, which has the largest market share of the three brewers in Malaysia, recently celebrated Guinness's 250th anniversary with a concert near Kuala Lumpur featuring the Black Eyed Peas.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"PIXIES MINOTAUR You smell ''Minotaur'' first, faintly, a light musk wafting off the box. And what a box: a mottled brown, almost two feet long by more than a foot wide, with a pelt-like texture that's surprisingly soft, for a box, not at all unpleasant. It's heavy, too, at 25 pounds. The required heavy lifting (and spending) has a Darwinian effect; it selects its owners in a Herculean fashion, so brute in its presence that it demands attention. All five albums are here -- ''Come On Pilgrim,'' ''Surfer Rosa,'' ''Doolittle,'' ''Bossanova,'' ''Trompe Le Monde'' -- on 24-karat gold-plated CD and 180-gram vinyl and in Blu-ray audio. Let's face it, though: you have the music already (and if you don't, there are far more efficient ways to get it). Which is fine, because ''Minotaur'' isn't about music: it's about dedication, obsession, sense activation, one-upmanship, indie-rock consumer porn. Each copy is signed by the band and individually numbered, one of 3,000 made. The package was compiled by the graphic designer Vaughan Oliver and the photographer Simon Larbalestier, who collaborated on all of the original Pixies' album art. Their work is ghoulish and stark and tactile, captured here in an oversize book and a giclée print, rough to the touch. This doorstopper of a set is called the ''limited'' edition: a ''deluxe'' version is available too, at one-quarter the weight and one-third the price, and with only half of the good stuff. But what sort of commitment is that? (Artist In Residence, five CDs, five records, two DVDs, one Blu-ray disc, two books and two posters, $495.) JON CARAMANICA"

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Art books and books about art may be two different things. Those in the first category show, with ample size and masses of pictures; those in the second tell, with writing on the subject outweighing reproductions of it. PAINTING ABSTRACTION: NEW ELEMENTS IN ABSTRACT PAINTING, a lively survey by the independent curator and critic Bob Nickas, is big and bright (six and a half pounds and cadmium red). Each of the 80 artists included in the book is represented by three or four full-page color images and a short essay (balancing show with tell). It is weighted toward young talent from New York, and not surprisingly peppered with artists Mr. Nickas has included in gallery group shows he has organized over the years. But it is great to have some order brought to ''the persistence of abstraction,'' as Mr. Nickas calls it. Think of this as a giant survey exhibition that didn't -- probably couldn't, maybe shouldn't -- happen, and a useful tool in forming a sharper, broader sense of what is going on in the world of abstract painting. (Phaidon, $75.) Also recommended from the same Phaidon series: PAINTING TODAY, by Tony Godfrey, which goes back to the 1980s for its nearly eye-bogglingly global view of the medium in all styles.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"BIG STAR KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKY Big Star started out as a Memphis band that merely sought to outdo the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks and the Byrds, adding some Memphis rock and soul. Big Star was already a slight throwback in the early 1970s but was also bursting with possibilities. It had open-ended studio time and some pop experience; one of its songwriters, Alex Chilton, had sung the Box Tops hit ''The Letter.'' But Big Star's fate was a perfectly disastrous combination of talent, musical ambition, personal temperament and bad luck. For Big Star's 1972 debut, ''#1 Record,'' it was led by Chris Bell and Mr. Chilton, a pairing that mixed lapidary, melodic songwriting and studio embellishments with a brash willingness to reveal every hope, fear and yearning. Mr. Bell left after ''#1 Record'' flopped, fumbled by its label. That left Mr. Chilton to lead a three-man band on the rawer, guitar-centered but still pop-minded ''Radio City.'' Then came ''3d,'' essentially a Chilton solo album assisted by Big Star's drummer, Jody Stephens. It held eerie, bereft songs in a paradoxically pretty orchestral haze: ''Nothing can hurt me,'' Mr. Chilton sang. ''Nothing can touch me.'' Latter-day fans reclaimed Big Star's albums as foundations of both crafty power-pop and disheveled indie-rock. This loving collection is virtually the complete 1970s Big Star: demos, a video clip, a 20-song live disc by the three-man band and the solo single Mr. Bell made before he died in a car accident. Alternate mixes, usually more cluttered, replace some original album tracks, but no matter: the fans already have those. (Rhino, four CDs, $69.98.) JON PARELES"

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"The frantic pace of urbanization in China has made conventional urban planning strategies seem pointless. How, after all, do you plan cities that grow by a few million inhabitants in less than a decade? LEARNING FROM HANGZHOU is a delirious effort to make sense of this historic urban phenomenon. The book, whose title is a witty reference to Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour's 1972 book, ''Learning From Las Vegas,'' examines everything from the Chinese city's rampant commercialization to the poor quality of housing for its migrant workers and the constant, 24-hour cycles of demolition and construction. This may be as close as you can get to seeing the future, and it's both euphoric and terrifying. (timezone8, $45.) Although women formed the majority of the Bauhaus's student body in its early years, the role they played in shaping the school's radical agenda has been largely ignored. Now BAUHAUS WOMEN comes along to correct the historical record. The book touches on how women's ideas about sexual liberation -- refusing to wear corsets, exercising bare-legged in city parks -- challenged the rigid class boundaries and sexual prudery of post-World War I Germany. But it was the spirit of creative collaboration they fostered -- mostly working in the school's textile, weaving, ceramics and industrial design workshops -- that helped define the Bauhaus's greatness.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"THERE are numerous ways to invent history, as seen in this year's assortment of boxed sets. Some prefer the full-catalog purge, and others the rarities and remixes. Some celebrate received wisdom; others, alternate stories. And when all that's done, some start over, taking another look with fresh eyes. That there would be only one way to go about the task is a folly fading more with each passing year. Here the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times review the notable boxed sets and anthologies of 2009. JON CARAMANICA AC/DC: 'BACKTRACKS' A set of B sides, Australia-only album tracks, live recordings and video from the full career of one of the most reliable bands in the world. Perhaps you don't know the studio songs -- like ''Crabsody in Blue,'' a slow shuffle about a sexually transmitted disease, bounced from most editions of the ''Let There Be Rock'' album on grounds of raciness -- but you know what you're getting. Unison guitar riffs, that comfortable stomp, up-front songs of domination and teasing. The DVD is almost worthless -- cheesy promo clips for commercials, mostly -- but the live disc, with good sound, is where it's at. From 1977 to 2000, from ''T.N.T.'' to ''Back in Black,'' through the lustiest crowd roars you've ever heard, the band is loud, steady and endlessly entertaining. (Sony Legacy, two CDs and one DVD, $39.98; a deluxe collector's edition, with an extra CD of live rarities, an extra DVD of a 2003 concert in Munich, an illustrated book and a vinyl LP of some of the studio material, is available only at acdcbacktracks.com for $199.) BEN RATLIFF TITE CURET ALONSO: ALMA DE POETA A court ruling in a copyright dispute early this year made it possible for disk jockeys and performers to play the songs of Tite Curet Alonso, probably the greatest composer of salsa. The reaction was immediate: a stadium concert in San Juan, P.R., celebrating his music, and this two-disc selection of his greatest songs, as performed by various artists. If you're like me, you're used to listening to salsa by group or singer, not by songwriter, but here are some of the sharpest and most moving songs the genre produced in the 1960s and '70s: ''La Tirana,'' by La Lupe; ''Periódico de Ayer,'' by Héctor Lavoe; ''La Esencia del Guaguancó,'' by Willie Rosario; ''Anacaona,'' by Cheo Feliciano. (Strangely missing: Willie Colón and Lavoe's ''Calle Luna, Calle Sol'' and Rubén Blades's ''Plantación Adentro.'') (Emusica, two CDs, $19.49.) BEN RATLIFF JOHN COLTRANE: SIDE STEPS Before he cleaned up his life, got his own band and made some of the best jazz records ever, John Coltrane worked as a sideman over and over again in ad hoc bands for Prestige Records, a label that pumped out product with loose quality control. ''Side Steps'' collects albums released under the leadership of Elmo Hope, Tadd Dameron, Red Garland, Sonny Rollins, Gene Ammons, Mal Waldron and the tuba player Ray Draper. On average, they're ... average. (Rollins's ''Tenor Madness,'' with its famous Rollins-Coltrane duel, and Garland's elegant ''Soul Junction'' constitute its peaks.) You can hear a great musician rising to his feet: especially by late 1957, Coltrane's sound is unmistakable. Still, these are records best understood as day work. (Prestige, five discs, $59.98.) BEN RATLIFF MILES DAVIS: THE COMPLETE COLUMBIA ALBUM COLLECTION What's not here? His beginnings as a New York bebopper; his ''Birth of the Cool'' period; a few great sessions from 1954; the beginnings of his 1950s quintet with John Coltrane; the worst of his late-period fusion. What's here? Absolutely everything else from 1957 to 1985, one new live recording (from the Isle of Wight, 1970) and a superb concert DVD of his quintet with Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock in 1967. The albums are mostly presented here in original form, without outtakes, as you might have known them when they first came out, but a lot crisper than they sounded back then. It's a story of an artist changing his music every year or so, remarkably uninterested in jazz as a genre but rather as a process, constructing one mountain after another and charging up it: ''Milestones,'' ''Miles Ahead,'' ''Kind of Blue,'' ''Nefertiti,'' ''In a Silent Way,'' ''Get Up With It.'' What, you don't like ''Get Up With It?'' You're among those who think he lost it after ''Filles de Kilimanjaro?'' Study this, and we'll talk.

2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"Is it a sign of the imminent end of days when Bob Dylan makes a Christmas album? Perhaps it's just further proof of the proposition that sooner or later, a career in music is bound to include something for the holidays. Christmas albums are concept albums, but the concept is supremely flexible: sincere or joshing, worshipful or iconoclastic, modest or bombastic, traditionalist or revisionist, somber or silly, all of which are represented (sometimes on the same album) by this year's releases. Here the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times unwrap some notable seasonal albums. JON PARELES TORI AMOS: MIDWINTER GRACES (Universal Republic; CD/DVD; $19.90) This high priestess of introspection addresses the season through a personal haze, wringing original music from the carols of her childhood. Gorgeously recorded and impeccably produced, ''Midwinter Graces'' includes some characteristic stunners, like ''Star of Wonder,'' inspired by the three kings from the East, and ''Holly, Ivy and Rose,'' with a dramatic Celtic lilt. The album also dwells in hymnlike serenity and diaphanous wonder, with only a few glaringly awkward moments, like ''Pink and Glitter,'' a big-band number that feels neither deft nor genuine. Throughout Ms. Amos shows herself to be right at home with the trappings of nativity, up to and including the frankincense. NATE CHINEN DAVID ARCHULETA: CHRISTMAS FROM THE HEART (Jive, $13.94) Of course: David Archuleta, after all, is basically a lamb, all youth, softness and gratitude. (On the cover of ''Christmas From the Heart'' he cracks an almost preposterous smile, as if you just said something that validated his life.) Aside from the last track, ''Melodies of Christmas,'' this music is not as cynical as his usual romantic dance-pop. Though his light, sweet, note-scooping alto comes unmistakably from the last 20 years of R&B, this record looks toward an older and stodgier tradition of record making, and takes it seriously. A full orchestra drapes itself over nearly every track, and the large-scale arrangements transcend the obvious, even borrowing a little ersatz Andalusian guitar for the climax of ''What Child Is This.'' As for Mr. Archuleta, he sings in a Hebraic-sounding French in ''Pat-a-Pan,'' Spanish in ''Riu Riu Chiu'' and Latin in ''Ave Maria.'' He's reaching. BEN RATLIFF"
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"COSTELLO--Timothy, age 65, of New York City and Shelter Island, NY on November 25th, 2009, beloved husband of Kathryn. Many New Yorkers knew Tim as the former owner of Costello's Restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. His death came after a valiant, l5-year battle against lung disease. A consummate son-in-law, brother-in-law, cousin, uncle, and friend, Tim was loved by all who knew him. The family and friends salute the extraordinary care he received from Dr. Byron Thomashow, Columbia Presbyterian Hospital Lung Transplant Team, and CTICU. Viewing: Shelter Island Funeral Home, Sunday, November 29th, 3-5 and 7-9pm and Monday morning, November 30th, from 9-11:30am with a funeral Mass to be held at noon at Our Lady of the Isle on Shelter Island."
2009-11-27T00:00:00Z,"As the death watch for the CD continues, so does the flow of classical CDs: no longer a flood but not yet a trickle. The labels that used to be considered major no longer dominate the field, to the extent that they are players at all. But excellent recordings keep coming out from a variety of sources: in some cases the artists or performing institutions themselves. In any case, the classical critics of The New York Times had no difficulty finding a list of worthies to cite as records of the year for 2009. JAMES R.

Here is an sampling of readers' replies: The article describes a very common situation for those not in group plans. As a former sales rep for individual health plans, I used a 145-page guide of exclusions for pre-existing conditions, ''hazardous'' activities and occupations, out-of-limit weight, and use of certain medications. Many of my friends who are covered by company group plans just don't understand the high cost exposure potential and the exorbitant premiums of individual plans which still don't provide coverage for many illnesses. Many holders of such plans are covered for the catastrophic costs, but are reluctant to get the colonoscopy or the CT scans recommended by the doctor because of high deductibles. Not much chance for prevention when you can't afford to pay for it."

Putin's visit to Paris was one that has proved particularly difficult to ignore: the 23,700-ton French warship that docked in the middle of St. Petersburg this week as part of an extended sales pitch to the Russian government. For months, Russian officials have been negotiating with France over the purchase of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship, at an estimated cost of up to $750 million, and a license to build several more in Russia. The high-tech ship would stand out in Russia's aging fleet. Vladimir S. Vysotsky, commander of the Russian Navy, noted this fall that if he had had access to such a ship during the 2008 war with Georgia, it ''would have allowed the Black Sea fleet to complete its mission within 40 minutes, not 26 hours.''"

2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"Pop Formally, jazz and flamenco aren't particularly related beyond deep affinities held by musicians for one style or the other. But improvisers learned long ago that they can push music anywhere they like. CHANO DOMÍNGUEZ, the Spanish jazz pianist born in 1960 in Cadiz -- flamenco's birthplace -- has done a beautiful job of moving jazz and Spanish music together. His sets typically encompass songs by Thelonious Monk and Bill Evans, the Catalan folk art of Frederic Mompou and Cuban boleros. This week he's performing his own takes on the music from Miles Davis's album ''Kind of Blue.'' His excellent band includes the flamenco singer Blas Córdoba, the bassist Mario Rossy, the percussionist Israel (Piraña) Suárez and the dancer and palmero Tomás Moreno Romero, known as Tomasito. Why does a small band in a jazz club need a dancer? Because some kinds of motion qualify as music. Go see him: you'll understand.

Their appearance fees are lower, and they rarely are invited to the tournaments that offer the best prize money. For these players, the World Chess Cup now being held in Khanty Mansiysk, Russia, is a great opportunity.

2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"POSTHORN--Stanley. 24 December 1915 31 October 2009. Stanley Posthorn was a prominent public relations and marketing executive at Time Inc. who established a marketing presence for Fortune Magazine and was responsible for the innovative celebrity marketing campaigns at the then newly founded People Magazine that featured artists, politicians and celebrities such as Andy Warhol, Paul Newman, Joe Namath, Dinah Shore and many, many others. His efforts were largely responsible for People achieving the premier position in celebrity reporting that it still commands today. He died at the age 93 following a protracted illness according to his nephew Alan Dine. Posty, as he was to become known to his close friends, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He served with honor for over four years with the military, rising to the rank of captain. While serving in the conflict in France, he received a medal for bravery in action. After the war, Posty moved to New York and through his love of the theater and the fine arts he befriended artists such as Andy Warhol, Joe Brainard, Jim Dine, Ellsworth Kelly Rex Lau, Diane Mayo and Esteban Vicente, whose early work he collected. His art collection also included the works of Frank Stella, Robert Youngblood, Robert Rauschenberg and others. Over the years, he donated art works from his collection to numerous museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art and the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton. His Joe Brainard collection, donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was publicly shown in 2008. In addition to his volunteer leadership and philanthropy in the art world, Stanley actively supported the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where he provided gifts in the memory of his partner Norman Mann, and where his estate will create the Stanley Posthorn-Norman Mann Discovery Endowment Fund to support cutting edge research in perpetuity. His love for ""Ojay"" a Lakeland terrier, prompted him to include various animal shelters as major beneficiaries of his estate. Posty was also a founding member of the East End Gay Organization (EEGO) which fought back attempts to restrict Gays and Lesbians from congregating at Fowler Beach in Southampton. Posty will be remembered for his innovative and witty mind, for his readiness to share his personal views and opinions, his knowledge and experience in art and theater and for living a life that knew no boundaries. A memorial will be held honoring his life, work and friends. For more information please contact Posty2009@yahoo.com."

Renegade artist Robert Valenciano succumbed to his battle with cancer after a short stay at Cabrini Hospice in NYC, dying on November 13th in the arms of his sister Doris Caceres. Born in Santiago, Cuba on April 4, 1965, Robert and his sister left Cuba with their mother Leila Arrowsmith in 1970 immigrating to Union City, NJ. Robert was five years old. After moving to New York City in the early eighties, Robert became a prominent figure in the downtown gay club and bar scene, working and playing in numerous notorious late night clubs. A long time HIV/AIDS survivor, Robert was a challenging figure, a radical artist self-defined as having ""no commercial ambition."" His trajectory as an artist was kaleidoscopic, beginning as a self-taught fashion designer making one of a kind pieces for many downtown artists in the late eighties and early nineties. His inspiration and intuitive approach to creating moved him freely from fashion and poetry to composing electronic/computer generated music under the name ""Dwarf Colony."" For a time he also freelanced as a dresser for numerous Broadway theater productions. Along with drawing, collage and photography, Robert's mature work was punctuated by sculptures of carved wood; sexually aggressive forms encrusted with thousands of jeweled mirrors that are now in the hands of a few private collections. Robert's influential pioneering style, his generous free spirit and unapologetic approach to living life inspired all those who knew him. He is survived by his mother, Leila, his sister, Doris Caceres, her husband, John, and their children Olivia and Gabriel. Memorial services to celebrate and remember Robert's life will be held December 12th at 3pm at Grace and St. Paul's Church, 123 West 71st Street, NYC. Longtime friend Reverend Martin Hauser will be performing services. Instead of flowers, the family is encouraging friends and family to make a donation in Roberts name to the Gay Men's Health Crisis.

Its peculiar magic is that it always sounds both thoroughly familiar and entirely fresh. The score is a sequence of 53 short melodic figures, and once you've heard ''In C,'' you'd know those snippets anywhere. Yet no specific instrumentation or ensemble size is recommended, and though the musicians must play the 53 figures in order, they can do so at any tempo and with any number of repetitions. So no two performances are the same."

2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"OLIVIA JUDSON The basis of evolutionary potential is clear enough in principle. Whether a population can evolve to cope with new circumstances depends on how much underlying genetic variation there is: do any individuals in the population have the genes to cope, even barely, with the new environment, or not? If not, everybody dies, and it's game over. If yes, evolution may come to the rescue, improving, as time goes by, the ability of individuals to cope in the new environment. What determines the extent of the underlying genetic variation? Factors such as how big the population is (bigger populations usually contain more genetic variation) and how often mutations occur. Let me give an example of how this works. Imagine you have a population of algae that have been living for generations in a comfy freshwater pool. Now suppose there's a ghastly accident and, all of a sudden, the pool becomes super-salty. Whether the algae will be able to survive depends on whether any individuals already have any capacity to survive and reproduce in salty water. If none of them do, they all die, and the population goes extinct. But if some do, then the survivors will reproduce, and over time, beneficial mutations will accumulate such that the algae get better and better at living in a high-salt environment."

Not coincidentally, Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. But now comes news that more Americans are living with their parents. The recession has sent 10 percent of adults under 35 back home, a Pew survey says. In addition, 15 percent of adults under 35 said they had put off marriage; 14 percent postponed having a baby. Could this lead to the Italian problem? As the British politician David Willetts once observed, ''Living at home with your parents is a very powerful contraception.''"

BEHIND THE NEWS After Mr. Dobbs abruptly resigned from CNN on Nov. 11 rather than put aside his political views while on the air, rumors began that he would try to capitalize on recent Republican gains with a run for the Senate (or even the White House). But party officials in New Jersey worried that he would be a one-note candidate."
2009-11-29T00:00:00Z,"THE city's unofficial motto, ''Keep Austin Weird,'' blares from bumper stickers on BMWs and jalopies alike, on T-shirts worn by joggers along Lady Bird Lake and in the windows of independently owned shops and restaurants. It's an exhortation for a city that clings to eccentricity, even in the face of rapid development -- downtown Austin, for one, is being transformed with a fleet of high-rise condos and a W Hotel, scheduled to open late next year. But this funky college town, known for its liberal leanings and rich music scene, has little to worry about -- at least as long as its openhearted citizens, with their colorful bungalows and tattoos, do their part to keep the city endearingly odd. As one local put it: ''As long as Austinites keep decorating their bodies and cars, we're going to be fine.'' Friday"

Later in the chapter Nelson allows that while political correctness is not the ""all defining campus cultural force the right makes it out to be, it does operate, in some contexts absurdly."" His own example of absurdity (it occurred in his home department) is a faculty appointment that was derailed when it was discovered that the candidate, then teaching in New Zealand, had written a letter to a newspaper criticizing the practice of going barefoot in public places on the grounds that it promoted the spread of disease. A department member decided that the letter ""was an attack on the Maori people and thus racist,"" and even when it was determined that it is not the Maori, but ""white hippies, who go barefoot in New Zealand, the majority voted against pursuing the candidate in order, says Nelson, to prove ""themselves to colleagues of color."""

2009-11-30T11:02:52Z,"In these days of heightened computer security, an average computer user has to manage a hundred passwords in his or her head, or so it seems. Every computer system you use at work, and every Internet site you use regularly (or even once in a blue moon) wants you to create an account with a password. Not only that, the requirements for the passwords are becoming more stringent: mix up letters and numbers they say, and sometimes non-alphanumeric symbols too. Don't include any words that can be found in the dictionary, or the names of your children and pets. Change the password every ninety days. And don't write it down anywhere."

But I suggested to him that if the old server went down, it would be the most expensive $2,500 that he ever ""saved."" Clearly, the damage caused would far exceed the money saved.

""If the global numbers come out as CRU has presented over the years, then it will strike a blow to skepticism about global temperature trend records produced by CRU and restore a good deal of credibility to this area of climate science."""

But that’s all just water under the bridge now. Mr. Brantley writes that “the gentle, compassionate comic drama” at the Acorn Theater “has the sweet taste of redemption.” The story about a middle-aged man swept up in a affair with a younger woman, “re-establishes Mr. Lonergan, who hasn’t had a new play on the boards since 2001, as a possessor of all the crucial parts of a good dramatist’s anatomy: a critical mind, an empathetic heart and a musical ear that hears whole lives in sentences. And Mr. Broderick delivers his finest, most affecting performance in years.” Redemption indeed."

In a review in The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that Mr. Winterbottom had performed a valuable service by inoculating Sterne's book ''against the depredations of earnest, prestige-minded adapters, while preserving a lot of the book's insouciant, inventive spirit (and some of its best moments),'' adding, ''He has also paid loving, knowing tribute to the crazy enterprise of filmmaking, a torment to those mad enough to pursue it and a delight, at least in this case, for those of us lucky enough to sit and watch.'' 8 P.M.

2009-11-30T00:00:00Z,"JOSEPH--Frederick H.,of New York City and Andover, MA died on November 27, 2009. Born in Boston, MA in 1937, he was the son of Sara Mostowitz Joseph and the late Edward Morris Joseph. Mr. Joseph received an A.B. from Harvard College in 1959, and subsequently served as an ensign aboard the minesweeper USS Exultant, where he received a letter of commendation for devotion to duty for fighting a fire aboard ship. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. in 1963, Mr. Joseph began his career at E.F. Hutton in corporate finance, where he was trained by his friend and mentor John Shad. He joined Shearson Hammill's corporate finance department in 1970, and in 1973, was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Joseph joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1974 to co-manage the company's corporate finance department, and became Chief Executive Officer in May 1985. Drexel is credited with the commercialization of the high yield bond market, having underwritten more than 1500 issues and raising more than $158 billion from 1978 through 1989. This included many financings of less than $100 million, some of which funded entrepreneurial venture capitalists including Steve Wynn, T. Boone Pickens, and Ted Turner. From January 1994 until May 1998, Mr. Joseph was Chairman of Clovebrook Capital Corp., a boutique investment banking firm. From May 1998 until April 2001, he was a Senior Advisor and Managing Director of ING Barings LLC. Mr. Joseph returned to focus on middle market companies with Morgan Lewis Githens & Ahn, Inc., which was renamed Morgan Joseph & Co. Inc. in October 2002. Morgan Joseph since has developed into a company of more than 140 employees, which has completed more than $29 billion in transactions, including more than 140 M&A transactions and 90 financings. Mr. Joseph was a passionate outdoorsman and hobbyist. Hunting, farming, and horseback riding were an integral part of his life. He traveled through much of the US and Canada on hunting trips, frequently accompanied by friends, sons-in-law and grandchildren. His trophies included a Pope and Young-rated black bear and a Pope and Young rated atypical white-tailed deer. He also participated in numerous Outward Bound and NOLS exploration courses, including one to Africa with his son, Mark, and one to Mexico with his daughter, Tommi Beth, and her husband, Mike. He was often found working in his home blacksmith forge, where he designed and forged his own tools. He is survived by his wife, Linn Anderson of Andover, MA and her son Andrew Prezkop of Washington, DC; his children: Lisa and Bill Schultz of Summit, NJ; Melinda Burke of Brooklyn, NY; Amy and Jon Humphreys of Summit, NJ; Tommi Beth and Mike McHugh of Denver, CO; and Mark and Starry Joseph of Gloucester, MA; and his former wife, Susan Joseph of New Vernon, NJ. He was the beloved grandfather of Billy and Krissy Schultz, Charlotte and Daniel Burke, Molly and Olivia Humphreys and Lucy McHugh. He is also survived by his brother Stephen Joseph and wife Angelique Craney of Chester, CT and New York City; his sister Michelle Joseph Morris and husband Chris of Williamsburg, MA; his mother, Sara Joseph, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.

The next he was offering the Taliban a date to circle on their calendars, and hold out for throughout the American offensive to come - July of 2011, that is, when the Obama administration is now committed to beginning the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. This commitment, of course, was hedged with a substantial caveat: ""We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground."" But still, the date is there: After more than eight years of fighting the United States, our enemies know that we've set ourselves a deadline to win or get out that's only a short eighteen months away."

New Orleans Saints Coach Sean Payton used a Pro Bowl fishing trip three years ago to quiz Bill Belichick about the details of his seasons, the practice schedules, the personnel moves, hoping to divine the secrets that had won the Patriots two more Super Bowls since that stunner eight years ago. Lesson learned. On Monday, with playoff-level excitement in the city, the Saints eclipsed the Patriots as the N.F.L.'s most explosive team, whipping them, 38-17, and keeping the Saints' undefeated season alive at 11-0. With the Colts also at 11-0, this is the deepest into a season two teams have gone undefeated. Two years ago, that was the Patriots. Not anymore. They are 7-4 and still lead the American Football Conference East by two games. But with victories over only two teams with winning records and a flailing defense that gave up a combined 73 points to the Colts and the Saints, the Patriots look vulnerable against the league's elite teams. For the Saints, though, this could be a franchise-altering victory, one that finally vanquishes their long-held reputations as losers."

Caray's high-volume style was mixed with a penchant for bad play calls, embellishments and factual errors. His best known incident occurred during the American League Central Division tie breaker between the Twins and the Tigers in October. He called an obvious lineout this way: ''Line drive. Base hit. Caught out there. The runner tags. Throw to the plate. On target. And in time! A double play!'' In a memo sent to company employees, David Levy, the president of Turner Sports, wrote on Monday: ''Since the end of this year's M.L.B. playoffs, we've had several discussions with Chip Caray regarding 2010 and beyond.

2009-12-01T00:00:00Z,"As they determine how to address more pressing needs in left field and in their rotation, the Mets have turned their attention to improving the bench. They agreed to a one-year deal with the utility infielder and the clubhouse leader Alex Cora. And the Mets also agreed to terms with catcher Chris Coste and are also showing interest in another catcher, the free agent Henry Blanco. Originally signed to provide capable middle-infield depth, Cora took over at shortstop after Jose Reyes was lost in mid-May with a hamstring injury. He batted .251 and started 67 games -- 54 at shortstop, 13 at second base -- and played most of them with a torn ligament in his right thumb. After he tore a ligament in his left thumb in August, Cora, 34, elected to have season-ending surgery. Cora's professionalism and insistence on playing hurt earned him immediate respect in the Mets' clubhouse, where he mentored Fernando Martinez and encouraged Mike Pelfrey throughout his disappointing season.

The Mets, as you may have heard, are looking for a starting catcher and some power. So, done deal, right? Maybe, maybe not."

The Guardian reported that Katherine G. White of the Addison’s Disease Self-Help Group has written an article for Medical Humanities magazine in which she says that Austen probably died of tuberculosis caught from cattle. Ms. White examined correspondence from Austen, who died in 1817 at age 41, as well as recollections from her family, and concluded that she probably did not die of Addison’s disease or lymphoma, as medical researchers and biographers have speculated. “While lymphoma would be one possible cause of the exhaustion, recurrent fever, bilious attacks and rheumatic pains described by Austen,” Ms. White wrote, “disseminated tuberculosis affecting the joints and liver — probably of bovine origin — would offer a simpler explanation.”."

Additionally, employees will take a one-week furlough in the last week of the year, with additional rolling furloughs expected in the spring. The opera’s president, Kenneth R. Feinberg, said the company had achieved balanced budgets for two straight years, partly because of contributions from “a few exceptionally generous donors.”."

Julian Casablancas, the front man of the Strokes, told Billboard that the group would headline the Isle of Wight festival in Britain on June 12, alongside Jay-Z; the performance will probably be followed by other summer concert appearances in Europe and North America. “When we meet with the band and talk and play music, it’s just a different level of ease and comfort,” Mr. Casablancas told Billboard. “Everyone’s more easygoing and everyone feels more confident and just trusts each other a little bit.”."

She was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and has performed at some of the leading opera houses during her long career. Her voice was that of a coloratura soprano. Her premiere role was that of ""The Queen of the Night"" in Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"", which requires the singer to reach the highest notes of any operatic work. Graduating from musical academy in Sofia, in the early 1940s, Ms. Simeonowa went to Austria to complete her operatic training. The war prevented her from returning to her home and she remained in Austria until the war's end. Later she went to Germany and entertained the American troops throughout Germany with popular songs in seven languages. In 1948, she signed her first opera contract in Kaiserlauten and remained there for two years where she performed with numerous opera companies where these companies would share their singers as back-ups if one of their own became incapacitated. The capstone of her career was when she was selected to perform as the Queen of the Night at the Salzburg Music Festival in Austria. She replaced the scheduled performer who had suddenly become ill. On 24 hours notice, she was fitted into the appropriate costume, rehearsed and performed this difficult role to great acclaim. Ms. Simeonowa came to the United States to continue her career in this country. She auditioned for Rudolph Bing, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and several months later received a call from his office to meet with Mr. Bing. Unfortunately, she had received a call from a German opera company and left for Europe the day after receiving Mr. Bings' call. In the United States, Ms. Simeonowa sang on numerous concert stages and reprised her role in The Magic Flute with the San Francisco Opera company with great success. Ms. Simeonowa leaves her husband, Benjamin Kinberg, a product designer and two sons, Boris, percussionist of Mink DeVille, and Max, a composer who resides and works in Hollywood.

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when federal lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restricted, but the film business is putting out more unrated DVDs that may contain material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for display in theaters. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a survey of shoppers by the commission.

The gaming industry, the report said, has ""the strongest self-regulatory code"" and has generally good compliance with its standards."

The garments are all in pristine condition, and there is usually an interesting story behind them. Currently for sale are a leather and gilt Chanel belt with a mosaic CC logo, a 1970s Courreges Future Couture backless velvet dress and a Christian Dior cocktail number designed by the late Yves Saint Laurent. Gentlemen, lest you feel left out, Cairone just started selling men's clothes, some of which have been lent out to Brad Pitt.

The program's nine months of tours, discussions and online activities are designed to celebrate and preserve L.A.'s modern architecture, cementing the notion that the sites are, in fact, historic. In the 1960s the city became the epicenter of innovation, thanks not only to the tract houses built after the Case Study Houses program but also to cerebral works like the Los Angeles International Airport Theme Building, the Music Center by Welton Becket in Bunker Hill, the now endangered Century Plaza Hotel by Minoru Yamasaki (above) and the space-pod Chemosphere house by John Lautner.

The report is the seventh in a series that began in 2000, when lawmakers asked for regular monitoring of the marketing of violent entertainment to youth. The reports have found that the marketing of violent images by the film, music and gaming industries has become more restrictive, but that the film industry is putting out more unrated DVDs that may include material more explicit than versions of the same films that were rated R or PG-13 for theatrical release. And retailers sold R-rated DVDs to those under 17 more than half the time in a shopper survey by the commission. The music industry drew criticism for failing to display readable parental-advisory labels in online and television advertising. The gaming industry, the report said, has “the strongest self-regulatory code,” and has generally strong compliance with its standards."

2009-12-04T00:00:00Z,"So it looks as if Judge Otis D. Wright II of the United States District Court for the Central District of California has had some interesting bedtime reading over the past few months. Before dismissing a plagiarism case brought by the author Jordan Scott against Stephenie Meyer, above, the author of the blockbuster best-selling “Twilight” series, Judge Wright (or his clerks) had to read both “Breaking Dawn,” the fourth and final (we think) installment in the “Twilight” series, and “The Nocturne,” Ms. Scott’s novel, the first in a projected trilogy, to make extensive comparisons. Ms. Scott had suggested that because of similarities in the novels, involving a wedding, a consummation scene on the beach and a subsequent childbirth, that Ms. Meyer had copied Ms. Scott’s work. In a decision filed late last month, Judge Wright ruled that the novels were “not substantially similar as a matter of law” and admonished Ms. Scott for her “deceptive presentation of the alleged similarities.” Among the judge’s many detailed comparisons, he found that the dialogue in both books was substantially different. The speech in “The Nocturne,” he wrote, is “an amalgamation of largely archaic and some modern language that is likely unparalleled in either classical or modern literature.” By contrast, the dialogue in “Breaking Dawn,” he wrote, “maintains a very modern and fresh tone throughout the story that is appealing to a younger audience.”."

2009-12-05T00:00:00Z,"The little typewriter that clacked out about five million fairly renowned words over 50 years — with the able assistance of the novelist Cormac McCarthy — ended up being worth a lot more than anyone expected. The heavily weathered, light blue Lettera 32 Olivetti manual machine, below, that Mr. McCarthy said he bought in 1963 for $50 and used to type all his novels, including those that won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award, sold on Friday at Christie’s to an unidentified American collector for $254,500, more than 10 times its high estimate of $20,000. (The price includes Christie’s commission.) The proceeds will be donated to the Santa Fe Institute, a nonprofit interdisciplinary scientific research organization. Glenn Horowitz, a rare-book dealer who handled the auction for Mr. McCarthy, told The New York Times earlier this week: “When I grasped that some of the most complex, almost otherworldly fiction of the postwar era was composed on such a simple, functional, frail-looking machine, it conferred a sort of talismanic quality to Cormac’s typewriter. It’s as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife.” Mr. McCarthy will not be using the opportunity to go digital after all these years. A friend of his recently bought him a replacement typewriter — the same Olivetti model — for less than $20."

He recognized that a strong scientific base would help establish the credentials of the nascent hospital and he continued to strongly support scientific research throughout his tenure; he was well known for his own work on hypertension in the 50s and 60s. Hundreds of doctors on Long Island trained at his side and continue to be amongst the areas most esteemed doctors.

In the end, the board wanted a new face who could change the company faster. ''My biggest strength is I've been with G.M. for 25 years,'' Mr. Henderson reportedly remarked, ''and my biggest weakness is that I have been with G.M. for 25 years.''"

But if the Los Angeles Conservancy has its way, its Sixties Turn 50 campaign will domore than inspire retro design. The program's nine months of tours, discussions and online activities are designed to celebrate and preserve L.A.'s modern architecture, cementing the notion that the sites are, in fact, historic. In the 1960s the city became the epicenter of innovation, thanks not only to the tract houses built after the Case Study Houses program but also to cerebral works like the Los Angeles International Airport Theme Building, the Music Center by Welton Becket in Bunker Hill, the now endangered Century Plaza Hotel by Minoru Yamasaki (left) and the space-pod Chemosphere house by John Lautner.

The temporary pavilion at this year's fair made a deliberately monumental statement, as opposed to the ethereal, dematerialized one in 2008. (Both were designed by the New York architects ArandaLasch.) And in contrast to last year's daylight-filled interiors, this year's were theatrically lighted ''to focus attention on the 'actors' -- the furniture and people,'' according to Ambra Medda, Design Miami's director and co-founder. Chief among them was Maarten Baas, the 2009 Designer of the Year, who showed, among other things, an ''evolution'' of the ''Real Time'' video clock series that drew raves during Milan's design week. In a similar vein, Fendi and Design Miami built on last spring's ''Craft Punk'' exhibition, now with a little less craft and a little more technology, to demonstrate that the two ''are not in opposition,'' Medda said. The design-tech wizard Moritz Waldemeyer customized Gibson guitars with lasers; when the guitars are played (as they were, at a party, by the band OK Go), the lasers ''illustrate'' the music on a video wall. HSBC commissioned a bench from Arik Levy, while Swarovski presented a crystal sail designed by the Los Angeles architect (and avid sailor) Greg Lynn.

Bush was elected president. That was the season in which Michael Jordan hit his famous jump shot over Cleveland's Craig Ehlo, and David Robinson was on his way to winning rookie of the year. Sloan, right, has led the Jazz to the playoffs 18 times in 20 seasons, winning the Western Conference in 1997 and 1998, but he has never been coach of the year."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"-- for years, the designer Jason Miller has made a living reinterpreting Americana. (Last winter, he went so far as to style his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, apartment like a 1970s rec room.) But nothing has brought him more fame or funds than his Superordinate Antler Lamps. To Miller, the success of a big, expensive ceramic chandelier makes total sense. ''A light is the first thing people notice when they walk into a room,'' he says, ''so you want it to say something, and you're willing to pay more for it.'' With that in mind, Miller has created an as-yet-unnamed lighting firm, with products set to make their debut at next spring's furniture fair in New York. He will produce his own work and will cherry-pick the best of his colleagues', like Paul Loebach's triangulated aluminum Himmeli lights or Sarah Cihat and Michael Miller's rocker-chic porcelain-and-chain lamps. For now, Miller will be keeping the whole affair stateside, sourcing American designers and local manufacturers. As for the branding campaign, he's already chosen the perfect all-American delegate: Andy Spade. JILL SINGER"

We have a long tradition of not talking about other companies, which I'll stick to. Barnes & Noble claims on its Web site that the Nook has several advantages over the Kindle -- for one thing, a Nook book can be lent to friends. You can forward the text to another user. The current thing being talked about is extremely limited. You can lend to one friend. One time. You can't pick two friends, not even serially, so once you've loaned one book to one friend, that's it."

He was President of KTAV Publishing House, Inc., a publisher of Hebrew and English textbooks, scholarly Judaica, and prayer books that educated the world-wide Jewish community for three generations. Sol Scharfstein has written and created more than 100 textbooks and educational devices with subjects including the Hebrew language, history, prayer, the Bible and children's stories. His first book, Haveri, published in 1954, was the first Hebrew language textbook published in full color and has sold over 1 million copies. It is still in print. His latest book, which has received much critical acclaim, is The Five Books of Moses: An Easy-to-Read Torah Translation. In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from Yeshiva University for his contribution to Jewish education. Sol Scharfstein was born in 1921 to Fannie and Asher Scharfstein in Dinivetz, Russia and came to America at the age of six months. He graduated Stuyvesant High School in New York in 1939 and enrolled in New York University. His studies were interrupted when he enlisted in the army during World War II. He served in the European Theater of Operations from 1941-1943. Scharfstein graduated from New York University in 1945 with a B.S. in Chemistry. He also graduated Herzliah Hebrew Teachers College. He joined the family business, KTAV Publishing House in 1945. Scharfstein headed a delegation of Jewish publishers to the Soviet Union in 1981 during the Cold War. This was the first exhibit of Jewish publications since the establishment of the Communist regime in 1917. Scharfstein married Edythe Shore in 1946, who survives him. In addition to his wife Edythe, he is survived by his children Alan (Karen), Janet (Jay), Joel (Deborah) and brother Bernie (Barbara) and seven grandchildren."

Joshua is in eighth grade at the Manhattan East School in East Harlem; he said math is his most challenging class. He likes to draw, listen to Nirvana, write songs and sing in a band. After a period of ''culture shock,'' Joshua said he now appreciates the extra ''zest'' of the city. ''It's sort of like the butter that you put on your pancakes,'' he said."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"AS regular readers of the Frugal Traveler column may surmise, I am somewhat reluctant to buy, well, things. It's not stinginess on my part -- it's that I dislike spending money on needless, often useless objects. Waste is the antithesis of frugality, and unnecessary belongings can make travel more difficult than it already is. The same logic also operates in the holiday season. I don't want to give -- or receive -- anything that, while momentarily amusing, fails to provide a useful function, or on the other hand is functional but charmless. And, needless to say, it shouldn't be expensive."

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"If you thought that conspicuous consumption was a recent phenomenon, consider ancient Rome, where Julius Caesar had to enact sumptuary laws to limit who could wear pearls and how. Grimly noting the furor that had seized Roman ladies, Seneca, the Stoic, commented: ''Simply one for each ear? No! The crazy fools seem to think that their husbands are not sufficiently tormented unless they wear the value of an inheritance in each ear.'' Of course, women -- and an Indian maharajah or two -- would go on to do a lot more with pearls than bedizen their ears. At the height of the pearl's importance in Elizabethan England, the queen thought nothing of scattering hundreds over everything she wore, including her hair."

Maybe the breast-accenting blouses at Miu Miu will be what puts you over the edge, or the corsets for evening at Christian Dior, or the bras and jackets at Jean Paul Gaultier. Whatever the case, we're hoping you TiVoed the Victoria's Secret show, which ran on television last week, to consider a more accessible take on the underwear-as-outerwear trend. What's not to like about the world's most expensively staged, laciest, most crystal-encrusted peep show?

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"The National Football Conference has become a two-team race. The brutal, efficient Minnesota Vikings (10-1) are in one corner, and the electrifying New Orleans Saints are in the other. All other contenders are just fodder. Dallas will fumble the holidays away, Philadelphia will suffer an eight-field-goal 27-24 wild-card loss, and Green Bay will have a break-even game in which it gains 400 yards from scrimmage but gives 399 of them back on sacks and penalties. The Arizona Cardinals (7-4) are a small step above the other conference midmajors, but their hopes rest with Kurt Warner, whose possible absence drains some appeal from a Warner-versus-Brett Favre battle of American alpha-male archetypes. The confluence of concussion complications and complicated league concussion policies make it impossible to determine a player's status until he jogs onto the field. Warner practiced, but he visited an ophthalmologist. A quarterback seeing double against the Vikings risks getting sacked by four Williamses, so assume nothing."

He delighted in family, friends and colleagues worldwide, nature, photography, and exploring other cultures, but above all, science. He explained, ""forces which impel me are largely the compulsion to look for the new, to change for the better, be it by finding better ways to do things or by inventing products to make the world function better. Gratifyingly, these often make the world aesthetically more pleasant and sometimes cleaner."" Born in Brooklyn in 1915, he graduated from Polytechnic Country Day School 1932, Harvard AB 1936, AM 1937, PhD 1939. After joining DuPont in 1938, he developed the first practical adhesive for bonding rubber to nylon for B-29 bomber tires, discovered light-fast dyes for cotton, led development of dyes for polyester and acrylic fibers, and served as DuPont's Director of Research and Development for synthetic rubbers and plastics from 1963-1980. Herman contributed to the development of a variety of specialty elastomers including DuPont's pioneering work on polyetherurethanes which led to ADIPRENE, CORFAM and LYCRA; the first sulfur-curable ethylene propylene rubber NORDEL; HYTREL thermoplastic polyetherester; VITON and KALREZ fluoroelastomers; and VAMAC ethylene acrylic elastomer. He held 37 patents, published 40 papers, and edited treatises on thermoplastic elastomers. He served on advisory groups for the British High Polymer Institute, Harvard University, Industrial Research Institute, International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, Textile Research Institute, University of Delaware Research Foundation, US Armed Forces, US Department of Commerce, and Winterthur Museum. To help preserve art treasures for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he gave technical advice on chemical reactions and their detrimental effect over time. He was honored by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers, and received the Charles Goodyear Medal from the American Chemical Society. DuPont awarded him the Lavoisier Medal for Inspirational Research Leadership in 1992. He is predeceased by beloved wife Elizabeth and daughter and son-in-law, Nancy Carolyn and Dennis Tarczy and dear sister, Rose Brady. Survivors include two sons Edward Schroeder (Carol), Peter Schroeder (Linda) and daughter Martha Lewis (Charles), seven grandchildren, thirteen great-grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and many dearly valued friends.

Raised in Minnesota, Rosenquist, 76, doesn't resist labels like ''pop artist,'' but he's amused by the divisions they inspire. ''I had a show in Paree in 1964,'' he recalls, ''and the neo-Surrealist pope, Édouard Jaguer, said: 'You are a surrealist! And you must come to the Promenade de Vénus,' a cafe.'' The painter Pierre Alechinsky overheard this and, Rosenquist says, socked Jaguer in the face. ''I thought, Holy cow, this Paris is an amazing place! They'd hit somebody over art.''

2009-12-06T00:00:00Z,"After Walter Cronkite died earlier this year, Frank Mankiewicz, the onetime Democratic operative, recalled in The Washington Post how he had proposed that George McGovern select the CBS anchorman as his running mate during the 1972 presidential campaign. Cronkite was, of course, one of the most admired men in America and a known skeptic of the war in Vietnam. And yet McGovern's others advisers unanimously rejected the Cronkite gamble, not just because they feared he would say no but also because the boundary between journalism and elective office was so absolute that the thought of merging them struck aides as too desperate a ploy. Cronkite was ''wholly outside of politics,'' as Mankiewicz described it. Voters and party leaders, it was thought, could no more accept a newsman as a Democratic spokesman than they could imagine a politician broadcasting the evening news. Now it seems that Cronkite's brief moment as a vice-presidential contender may have been the first inevitable step down a treacherous path. Today we're not at all surprised to hear names like Chris Matthews and Lou Dobbs tossed around as candidates for higher office. And while it used to be that only political aides of notable talent, people like Bill Moyers and Pat Buchanan and George Stephanopoulos (and, well, Chris Matthews), could make the tricky transition from politics to TV news, now it's the politicians themselves -- Joe Scarborough, Mike Huckabee -- who find themselves ensconced as hosts on a cable-TV set. The door between politics and television news now isn't merely revolving; it spins so fast and so continuously that a fair number of people no longer seem to belong neatly on one side or the other. Is Sarah Palin, at this point, a politician, or is she the star of some ''frontier family'' reality show? In fact, she seems to realize that the changed environment allows her to be both at the same time."

Born in Washington to a German diplomat and a French porcelain painter, Baumer acquired wanderlust at an early age. ''I've always been influenced by the kaleidoscope of memories I carry back from my travels,'' he says, adding that quintessential Americana like surfing, fireworks, tornadoes, Mae West and the Brooklyn Bridge have also figured into his designs. L'Ame du Voyage -- Louis Vuitton's most ambitious foray into high jewelry to date -- contains six sets of jewels that each orbit a one-of-a-kind necklace. They all boast the new Louis Vuitton Flower or Star diamond cuts, inspired by the company's Monogram print, and some have fragments of a gold ''lace'' that Baumer designed with the logo in mind.

Most work for tips or minimum wage, and have the opportunity to buy health insurance through the company's group plan. Applicants to the new Applebee's, one of 20 now open in New York City, included people with college degrees, people who had worked at high-end restaurants, people who had applied for dozens of other jobs -- perhaps not surprising in the Bronx, the county with the highest unemployment rate in the state, 13.4 percent.

Better yet, the dolls come with biographies. Their fates are pretty much sealed, so they can't blame you for messing them up during those troublesome teenage years.

He became world known as editor of the journal ""Morphology"" for 25 years and as the editor of the monumental 23 volume ""Biology of the Reptilia"" published between 1969 and 2009. His first book-length publication was ""Biomechanics"" in which he combined his engineering and biology backgrounds. He coauthored two biology texts used in universities throughout the U.S.: ""A Photographic Atlas of Shark Anatomy"" and ""Electromyography for Experimentalists"". He also wrote the popular paperback book ""Reptiles of the World"" translated into many languages. His library of over 20,000 items in herpetology is currently at Ben Gurion University in Israel, which also has his extensive scientific correspondence. Other of his publications may be found at the Scripps Institute, University of California, San Diego and the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. His extensive animal collections which he gathered on five continents over many decades can be found at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburg, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard. Carl was predeceased by his wife of fifty years, Mabel Kyoko Andow. He is survived by his brother Leo Gans, of Teaneck, NJ. Memorial donations may be made to any charity of your choice."

The fair is about the commerce of bling, not the transformation of the spirit. Yet that is what arrived on Friday night, when the filmmaker Tamra Davis previewed her new documentary, ""Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child,"" at the Colony Theater on Lincoln Road.The film, which will premiere next month at the Sundance Film Festival, was a labor of love for Davis, who met the artist in 1983 and, with the screenwriter Becky Johnston, interviewed him on camera two years before his death, at age 27, from a heroin overdose. That was in 1988. Davis then put the footage away until a traveling museum retrospective made it clear that there was little of the actual Basquiat on film. (He played a character role in ""Downtown '81,"" and Julian Schnabel's ""Basquiat,"" with Jeffrey Wright in the title role, was partly fiction.)"

Fairey is no stranger to vandalism. As a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, he got his kicks pasting mysterious stickers about the wrestler Andre the Giant around town. Gradually, the sticker became the 1990s equivalent of Kilroy Was Here.In this video, directed by Crystal Moselle for our ""Something Big Something Small"" series, Fairey, who had several pieces at the fair (including two on canvas), shows the small sticker that started it all 20 years ago.

Performance art's comeback follows other art-world trends like photography, a return to painting and the rise of the multimedia installation. And after reading the actor James Franco's preaching in The Wall Street Journal about the history of performance art and presenting his 20-episode stunt in the soap opera ""General Hospital"" as an art piece, I cannot wait to see it going mainstream and worldwide.I am not sure what is driving this resurgence: is it a reaction against the excesses of the art market in previous years or an expression of its present crisis in 2009? Is it a form of rejection, an act against art consumption, a sign of fatigue over the art products now available in every fair and biennial in every corner of the world? We are so tired of the old paintings on the wall and of the edition-of-three garden sculptures. Don't we all want something unique and unrepeatable? Something that not only money can buy.

As <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/arts/music/13wclasslist.html"">James R.

Tonight, get an early glimpse of the Beckett angle at <a href=""http://www.92y.org/shop/event_detail.asp?productid=T-TP5MS10"">the 92nd Street Y</a>, where the Poetry Center is hosting a reading of Beckett’s works and a discussion with Mr. Dillane."

2009-12-08T17:40:46Z,"Waterford mashups, duct-taped club chairs - for years, the designer Jason Miller has made a living reinterpreting Americana. (Last winter, he went so far as to style his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, apartment like a 1970s rec room.) But nothing has brought him more fame or funds than his Superordinate Antler Lamps. To Miller, the success of a big, expensive ceramic chandelier makes total sense. ""A light is the first thing people notice when they walk into a room,"" he says, ""so you want it to say something, and you're willing to pay more for it."" With that in mind, Miller has created an as-yet-unnamed lighting firm, with products set to make their debut at next spring's furniture fair in New York. He will produce his own work and will cherry-pick the best of his colleagues', like Paul Loebach's triangulated aluminum Himmeli lights or Sarah Cihat and Michael Miller's rocker-chic porcelain-and-chain lamps. For now, Miller will be keeping the whole affair stateside, sourcing American designers and local manufacturers. As for the branding campaign, he's already chosen the perfect all-American delegate: Andy Spade."

As it turns out, the strain of the downturn hasn't pushed the divorce rate higher; instead, economic stress seems to have made American marriages slightly more stable overall, as couples develop a ""new appreciation for the economic and social support that marriage can provide in tough times,"" as the study's lead author, Brad Wilcox, puts it. Americans are also turning thriftier (saving more, cutting down on credit card debt, reviving home-based economies, etc.), which is good news for wedlock, since financial stability correlates with marital stability, and with marital happiness as well. If you squint a little at the data, you could even imagine that the recession, and the adjustments required by long periods of unemployment, might ""accelerate the social acceptance of women as equal breadwinners and men as capable parents and homemakers,"" as Christine Whalen writes in an accompanying essay, and make the institution of marriage more flexible and resilient in the long run."

This is roughly the opposite of what I intended in this post, but since I was apparently unclear, allow me to clarify. The (unlikely) scenario I spun out, in which a reinvigorated Islam manages a sweeping ""transformation of European culture,"" with a Ramadan-esque figure playing ""a Muslim Saint Paul to the E.U.'s Roman Empire,"" is one that I would regard with enormous dismay should it ever come to pass. That's why I suggested that were such a transformation likely or even plausible, it would merit ""the deepest sort of pessimism"" about Europe's future. My point was that any scenario for the wholesale Islamification of Europe seems relatively unlikely at this point; it was not that Islamification is desirable, as the key to the continent's ""spiritual reawakening."" I've never believed anything so fatuous, and never will."

2009-12-08T00:00:00Z,"The lead producer of the musical “Fela!” said on Monday that a “perfect storm” of injuries to its cast members had resulted in the cancellation of its Sunday-evening performance less than two weeks after its Broadway opening. The producer, Stephen Hendel, said in a telephone interview that three performers in “Fela!,” the dance-intensive musical about the Nigerian Afrobeat artist Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, were hurt. Daniel Soto, a dance captain, was out with a wrist injury; Nicole Chantal de Weever, an ensemble member, was elbowed in the eye by another performer during the Sunday matinee and taken to the emergency room; and Corey Baker, an ensemble member, developed back spasms just before the evening performance. Mr. Hendel said that the show’s understudies had not been rehearsed to perform without these ensemble members, leaving him no choice but to cancel the show. The situation was announced around 7:10 p.m. to ticketholders, who were offered replacement seats at future performances. “We just didn’t feel comfortable that we could deliver the show having three swings stand in,” he said. Mr. Hendel said that the injuries would not affect a planned appearance by the “Fela!” cast at a taping of “The Colbert Report” on Monday, and that the performers would be back for Tuesday night’s performance at the Eugene O’Neill Theater."

But, as he explained, ""it wasn't conducive to social interaction, and it certainly wasn't about the integration of art."" Rather than executing Wright's original sketches, Kikoski turned the space - most recently a generic cafeteria with brown carpeting - into a modern homage to the legendary architect, who designed the museum to harmonize with the artwork within."

The Blue Jays' new general manager, Alex Anthopoulos, has made himself scarce in the hotel lobby, which is probably a wise move. Even though trade talks have centered on other players - Curtis Granderson, Edwin Jackson, Milton Bradley, Kevin Millwood, et al - Halladay still lords over the winter meetings."

Chu, the Albert Ferguson associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and director of the Cartilage Restoration Center there, confirmed a theory, and found herself troubled by the results. It turned out that if you dropped a heavy weight onto parts of a cow's knee joint from various heights, the joint was hurt. (While the parts of the joint were damaged, the cow itself was uninjured by the experiment; the knees came from a local abattoir.) When the weight hit the joint's surface cartilage with great speed and force, the bone and cartilage fractured. No surprise there. But it is what happened in Dr. Chu's experiment when the impact was more subtle - closer to, for instance, the perturbations inside a human knee when a ligament is torn - that concerned her. She found that with lighter impact, the various parts of the knee appeared, visually at least, to be fine."

The table fills and fills and fills and at a certain point it begins to be ridiculous.” The restaurant may not be much to look at, in fact, Mr. Sifton describes it as “barnlike,” and the service is “brisk, almost brutally efficient.” But the dishes and “excellent” barbecue equal a kind of “heaven in midtown,” and that, we think, is too good to miss.</p>"

Now, as the troubled airline reorganizes after bankruptcy, it is selling many works from that collection, including a few that racked up some serious miles. More than 180 paintings, drawings, prints and other works from the collection were to be auctioned Tuesday night in Rome by Finarte Casa D’Aste, the auction house announced on its Web site, finarte.it.

Now the Irish government has made a more numerically quantifiable contribution in the form of a $3.5 million grant that will be used to build a new Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. The announcement was made in Ireland by that country’s foreign minister, Micheal Martin, and confirmed by Christine C. Quinn, the New York City Council speaker. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Ms. Quinn said the new Irish Arts Center would probably be at the institution’s current site, 553 West 51st Street in Clinton. The space hosts exhibitions and educational programs, and is also home to a 99-seat theater, but is not quite as green as it was at its founding in 1972. “Its heart and soul is a total treasure,” Ms. Quinn said. “Its physical shape has not quite kept up.” In addition to the contribution from the Irish government, the City of New York has committed $7.75 million in capital financing for the center, and additional contributions are expected from the federal government and private donors. A start date for construction was not announced."

The move is part of a reorganization started last year by Markus Dohle, right, Random House’s chairman and chief executive. Mr. Dohle announced plans to separate Crown’s trade publishing units — including general fiction and nonfiction books released under the Crown name, Clarkson Potter cookbooks and titles released by Shaye Areheart Books — from the Random House Audio business and the company’s information unit, which publishes Fodor Travel Guides and Princeton Review guides. Mr. Dohle appointed Maya Mavjee, executive publisher of Doubleday Canada Publishing Group, as president and publisher of the newly restructured Crown Publishing Group. Ms. Mavjee will start on Jan. 1. Reached by telephone on Tuesday, Ms. Frost, a 25-year veteran of Random House, said she was surprised by the decision. “I think that Markus has a different strategic vision,” she said, adding that she would take some time to think about her next career move. “It certainly was not what I was anticipating doing,” she said.
