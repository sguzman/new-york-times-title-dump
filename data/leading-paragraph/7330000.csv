2010-02-23T00:00:00Z,"The opera ""<b>Attila</b>"" is based on a German romantic play about Attila the Hun's attacks on Western civilization. The premise may not be everyone's idea of a fun night out, but just trust us on this one. Tonight, <b>Riccardo Muti,</b> the former music director and conductor of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, will make his long-awaited debut at the <b>Metropolitan Opera</b>, conducting the <b>Verdi</b> work. ""I find 'Attila' a very mysterious but exquisitely defined score,"" <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/arts/music/21muti.html?8ur&emc=ur"">Mr. Muti said in a recent interview</a>. ""In the prologue, as the Roman general Ezio plots with Attila to divide up the empire between them, Ezio sings, 'Avrai tu l'universo, resti l'Italia a me!' 'You can have the universe, leave Italy for me!' One can just imagine the effect that line must have had in 1846, delivered by the baritone over his full octave-and-a-half range. The first performance stopped dead and the audience went absolutely crazy."" This will be the company's first production of the early opera, directed by Pierre Audi, and it's worth going just to see the sets and costumes, designed by Herzog &#38; de Meuron and Miuccia Prada.

2010-02-23T00:00:00Z,"While they often seem flawless to most viewers, the top competitors in the women's figure skating have all received deductions for underrotating their jumps and most have been penalized at some point for entering a lutz or flip jump on the wrong edge. These errors are often difficult to discern, even to the most avid fans, so the technical panel of judges can use video replay to determine if these violations have occurred. The deductions can be costly: For underrotation, it is at least two-thirds of the value of the jump attempted, or starting at 4.1 points on a triple lutz.

2010-02-23T00:00:00Z,"CASTLEMAN--Randal L. With profound sorrow, the HM Community mourns the death of Randal L. Castleman, beloved friend, respected colleague, visionary educator and esteemed teacher of countless Horace Mann students and alumni. A dedicated and professional educator, Randal's graciousness, integrity, high educational and moral standards were inherent in every conversation, memo and daily encounter. In his years of service to Horace Mann, Randal has headed HM's Summer School, served as Head of the Upper Division in 1992, was Chair of the Upper Division English Department and held the position of Dean of Students, Grades nine thru twelve. At the time of his death Randal served as the Associate Dean of Student Life. In each position he served with great dedication, elegance and grace. He was a masterful English teacher of sublime intelligence, and his tenure as Head Librarian of the Theresa Loeb Library was an outstanding and distinguished one. He served with conviction and sound judgement on numerous committees. A small sampling includes: the Committee on Instruction (Chair), the Faculty Benefits and Compensation Committee and the Financial Aid Committee. His love and commitment to the students he advised and mentored are legendary. The Class of 2004 showed their deep appreciation for their grade dean when they dedicated their Mannikin in his honor. ""To the Class of 2004 Mr. Castleman is a teacher, a dean, a parent and mentor. He is an active member of the community attending athletic matches, arts, performances, student organized dinners, and athletic events. We are honored to have been able to develop such a unique relationship with our grade dean."" Randal's wit and sense of humor were keen and well honed. His ready smile and affability were all part of his wonderful persona. An accomplished athlete in his own right, Randal coached boys' and girls' varsity soccer for several years. His love of jazz, theatre, English prose and poetry, sports and his voracious appetite for reading and storing and sharing knowledge were inspirational. A dignified, reserved individual, he was, nevertheless, passionate in striving to help others. Randal was a man of strength and integrity who fought a courageous battle against the serious disease that afflicted him at the height of his career. Randal developed professional and personal relationships with HM parents and students, HM Trustees and administrators, HM Faculty and staff. HM alumni and with HM associates that span decades. At HM's 2004 commencement address to the graduating seniors, Randal said, ""Think of all the things you've had a chance to do here - of the games and the concerts and the plays and the publications and the conferences...you will remember what you got to do here. Because Horace Mann is...creative and energetic people coming together to do exciting things."" Dr. Thomas M. Kelly, Head of School commented, ""Since his arrival at Horace Mann in January of 1978, Randal has contributed to the very essence of HM in so many purposeful ways. From our libraries to our course offerings to many of the policies and procedures that continue to govern how we teach and care for our students, his contributions and keen insight serve as a shining example of the tremendous effect one person can have on a community."" Randal's love, warmth and depth of devotion to his wife, Cornelia Locher, to his children, Matthew HM 2004 and to Laura 2008 are acknowledged by all. We extend our thoughts and prayers to Cornelia, Matthew and Laura, and to Randal's beloved extended family and devoted friends. Horace Mann mourns the loss, honors the life, and celebrates the legacy of Randal L. Castleman. His remarkable presence will be remembered. The Castleman family has requested that donations in Randal Castleman's memory be made to: Horace Mann School - Financial Aid, 231 West 246th Street, Bronx, New York 10471. Thomas M.

In ""Mean to Me,"" a visually sumptuous 12-minute film noir written and directed by David McDermott and Peter McGough, Deyn trades her gamine look for raven-hued finger waves and crimson lips - all the better to deliver a blow to the head of her lover (the ""Law & Order"" star Linus Roache), wrestle him into the bathtub, tie him up and extort a sizable check. Set in the Great Depression and named for a popular song of the era, the artist duo's first scripted film chronicles the disastrous end of an affair. McDermott and McGough began collaborating 30 years ago, and capturing the essence of a time past has always been part of their work, so recreating the 1930s proved no challenge. Period-perfect down to its wallpaper, telephone and radio, McGough's Art Deco Manhattan apartment provided the set. Deyn's costumes, by Zac Posen, might as well be of that vintage. The Shalimar perfume and pearls, around which crucial plot points turn, were courtesy of Guerlain and Mikimoto, which underwrote the project. Deyn got the gig at the suggestion of McGough's pal Louie Chaban, director of Women Management. ""Peter asked for a girl who wanted to act,"" Chaban says. And can she?

The play by <b>Bruce Norris</b>, which opened Sunday night at Playwrights Horizons, ""focuses on the evasions, euphemisms and tongue-tied paralysis that afflict such discussions and comes to the conclusion that talk &#151; at least among the all-American solipsists he portrays &#151; is worse than cheap: it's valueless."" Half a century separates this ""spiky and damningly insightful new comedy,"" which is set in 1959 and 2009. Clybourne Park was the all-white Chicago neighborhood ""on which a hopeful African-American Southside family set its sights in 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 epochal drama. The house in the play is the dream house that Hansberry built, the place her upwardly mobile Younger family was planning to inhabit. In the first act the Youngers haven't arrived yet. In the second they're long gone, and Clybourne Park has become a very different, predominantly black neighborhood. And it is now a white family that wants to move into an area that shows every promise of being thoroughly regentrified."" In both parts of this production, ""Mr. Norris is examining his subjects through the same merciless telescope, with a historian's distance and an ethnographer's detachment."" "

It's thick with heavy breathing about the perils of religious influence on politics, but mostly that comes from old-guard Conservative apparatchiks quoted sniping at Montgomerie, rather than from the author's own editorializing. Overall, the story strikes me as a fair-minded look at the attempt to forge a distinctively Christian approach to right-of-center politics - and to do so in a country where religious believers are a distinct minority, and evangelicals are particularly marginal. There are echoes of the religious right and Bush-esque ""compassionate conservatism"" in what Montgomerie and Co. are up to, but also striking differences as well. And as with Cameronism writ large, I think that there are ways in which American conservatives - and social conservatives, obviously, in particular - might profit from their example."

And experienced riders grab the board to do tricks (as viewers of the Olympic Games have witnessed this month), so a firm grip is essential.

2010-02-25T00:00:00Z,"David Talbot, the author of ''Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years,'' has become the latest historian to add his voice to a chorus of pre-emptive criticism of ''The Kennedys,'' a planned mini-series that the producer Joel Surnow (''24'') is preparing for the History channel. Mr. Talbot's book was among the works cited by the ''Kennedys'' screenwriter, Stephen Kronish, as source material for the project in a recent article in The New York Times. On Thursday Mr. Talbot said that after the article appeared he was contacted by Robert Greenwald, the liberal filmmaker who has recorded other historians' critiques of the project and posted them at a Web site, stopkennedysmears.com, and who provided him with preliminary scripts for four episodes of ''The Kennedys.'' Having read the scripts, Mr. Talbot said they presented President John F. Kennedy as dithering and indecisive on the issue of civil rights and his brother Robert as being soft on organized crime, among other errors. ''You can't just make things up that 100 percent violate the truth,'' Mr. Talbot said. In a statement the History channel said: ''The mini-series will be historically accurate and based on the work of multiple noted scholars. Anyone claiming otherwise is basing their claim on inaccurate information that has not been vetted by the History channel.''"

Mr. Nars's approach -- a startling departure from last season's stridently colorful '80s-inspired paint -- was complemented by Guido Palau's honey-tone hair for a look as subtle as it was uncontrived. Elsewhere the palette was similarly muted, though enlivened here and there with frank theatricality. The models at Gary Graham (center, far right) showed off up-dos that were sculptured and teased for a wind tunnel effect; winged brows the color of anthracite underscored that streamlined look. At Vena Cava (right) and Costello Tagliapietra (below) scarlet lips peeking out from brimmed hats, or contrasting shrilly with ghostly pale skin, provided a touch of dramatic relief."

I disagree strongly with typical evangelical positions on gay marriage, abortion, abstinence only education -- but I also think that liberals don't appreciate the impact of the arrival of evangelicals into humanitarian space or give sufficient credit for that change. The United States is doing far more for Africa today than a decade ago largely because evangelicals became a strong constituency for the Pepfar AIDS program and the PMI malaria program. Liberals were always in favor of such ventures, and what changed was that conservatives pushed for them as well -- and of course the Bush White House listened to them in a way it did not listen to liberals.

But the decision by others hasn't pleased many coaches and general managers, who wanted to see quarterbacks -- the healthy ones, at least -- throw on neutral ground. (Central Michigan's Dan LeFevour irked them in particular, because he is healthy and, unlike Tim Tebow, is not revamping his throwing motion.)"

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Her Right Brain -Diane Keaton, who grew up in Southern California and whose favorite thing to do in life is ''cutting out pictures and dreaming,'' fell in love with magazines and imagery as a young girl. Her mother, whom Keaton describes as having had ''one of the great faces,'' set the standard for Diane and her three younger siblings by collaging everything in sight, including wastebaskets; she also kept numerous collage-journals, and Keaton has followed suit, although she no longer painstakingly pastes the images in. ''I put them in plastic and double up on the sides. More bang for the buck.'' Absolutely anything and everything can catch her vigilant, foraging eye, from the photo of a dog -- ''That is the most beautiful dog. I was very drawn to that dog. I'm nothing but a sap'' -- to a piece of fabric or a particular font. ''I like patterns -- plaids and stripes and polka dots -- as well as shapes, numbers and words.'' She considers a 1950s photo of her family standing in front of their car (below left) ''heartbreakingly ordinary and perfect. It's Everypicture, like Everyman.'' House Proud - Keaton, who is besotted with architecture and is doing her second book for Rizzoli on architectural style, inherited her love of houses from her father, who was a civil engineer. ''He used to take me when I was little to model homes. I thought they were dream homes.'' She has taken this interest to heart, using her keen visual sense and admiration for certain vernacular styles -- ''For the past 15 years, I've been extremely excited about Spanish colonial homes'' -- to energetically renovate several houses of her own, and three of them landed Architectural Digest covers. She has a preference for wood, is particularly drawn to kitchens and if she had her way would buy an old factory building and move it. ''Old material has a patina, a sense of emotion.'' Lately Keaton has been excited about barn structures -- ''It's a basic American look that's very appealing to me'' -- and feels a kinship with inventive regional architects like Tom Kundig, Howard Backen and Roy McMakin. ''I'm very interested in how one lives one's life within one's home. It's a safe confine within the crazy world we live in.''"

Sue brought people together; she had a joyous sense of fun and the capacity to make everyday life feel like a celebration. From the beginning of her adult life, Sue was passionate and unstinting in her charitable work.

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"JEFF KOONS, at 55, is one of the world's most famous living artists. And every night before drifting off to sleep in his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, he is able to survey the salmon-pink walls of his bedroom and commune with a small pantheon of the most famous artists of centuries past. In one corner hangs an early-16th-century painted bust of a hollow-cheeked, very tender-looking Jesus by Quentin Massys, the first important painter of the Antwerp school. Across the way, perhaps reflecting Mr. Koons's love of mingling the sacred and the profane, a risqué Fragonard stares back, showing a young woman cradling a pair of puppies at her bared breasts. But for the most part this extremely private collection, piled up salon style on the walls, seems far more classicist than Koonsian, like an eccentric little gallery transplanted from the Met: Manet, Courbet, Poussin and scholars' delights like Nikolaus Knüpfer and Cornelis van Haarlem."

But hey, did anyone question Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady when they crossed the country in search of hot chicks and enlightenment? They may have trekked in service of the dharma, but Laura and I -- and thousands of other women just like us -- are members of another powerful cult, one that worships the oddly charming Italian clothes, sort of a cross between Raggedy Ann on a bender and Sophia Loren in ''Two Women,'' that bear the Marni label."

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"''I am cursed to be in this Mother Hubbard body,'' Alice Neel once remarked of her grandmotherly image. The artist's sensitivity to nuances of style and gesture informs the portraits in ''Alice Neel: Painted Truths,'' a retrospective opening next month at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Since her portrait work was largely uncommissioned and did not require that she flatter the sitter, ''you get a sense of how people really looked,'' says Barry Walker, who, with Jeremy Lewison, curated the show. That's as true for the cheerful Fuller Brush man and Dachau survivor who showed up on her doorstep in 1965 as it is for the art-world elites who (eventually) posed for her -- including the Factory's Ritta Redd and Jackie Curtis (right) and Andy Warhol himself, seminude and scarred. (Neel was notorious for sweet-talking her subjects out of their clothes.) When faced with truly stylish subjects, like the art-world players John Gruen and Jane Wilson and their daughter, Neel focused on the psychological -- the self-assured couple and the young girl, hunched like a figure out of Munch -- but she didn't neglect the clothes.

Pal came to the United States from India by cargo ship in the 1950's, while only in his 20's. Despite huge obstacles and losing his father, he worked hard and received a Ph.D. from Michigan State University (MSU) in agriculture and soil sciences. He chose a path of service, working for the Food and Agriculture Organization in Kabul and Tanzania, and moved to New York in 1965, recruited by UNDP. In 1962, he married Thunga, a physics professor, and had three daughters. Pal received the Distinguished Alumni Award from MSU and was honored by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in The Hague for his ""untiring, devoted, and outstanding services in support of their efforts to help alleviate hunger and poverty through scientific research."" Pal's kindness, humor and pure child-like spirit touched the hearts of many. He opened his Kew Gardens' home of 25 years to many people until they were settled. Fluent in several languages, he had an outstanding memory and remembered hundreds of birthdays. He was known for his love of animals, music (his whistling and mimicry) and gardening, including growing banana trees and many plantings at the Maryland temple. Pal is survived by his beloved wife, three daughters (Sunita, currently chief engineer of the United States Department of Energy's Fuel Cell Program; Shobita, an astrophysicist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at George Mason University; and Shanti, a research analyst at the Institute for Defense Analyses), four grandchildren, and many devoted friends and relatives.

But a history of radioactive leaks at the aging Vermont Yankee plant and misstatements in testimony by plant officials challenged claims by nuclear advocates that nuclear plants were clean, well run and worth building."

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"In 1829, a year before Belgium gained independence from Holland, Charles Delvaux founded what would become the world's oldest luxury leather-goods company. Now pushing 200, Delvaux continues to make bags in small runs signed by master craftsmen. Which doesn't mean the label isn't looking toward the future. It has forged bag collaborations with the designer Bruno Pieters, the model Hannelore Knuts and the Belgian avant-gardist Natalia Brilli, who wraps watches and objects in taut lambskin. But Delvaux's biggest score to date was hiring Veronique Branquinho as artistic director. ''It's a legendary brand with a great history,'' says Branquinho, who in addition to reworking existing classics is introducing several new bag styles for spring -- most notably a deep-blue duffel and a buttery beige envelope (right). ''Many years ago, I received my first Delvaux from friends who purchased it at a vintage store,'' she says. ''It's still contemporary and beautiful after all these years.''"

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"If fashion is all about performance, then Chantal Thomass is a master player. Anyone familiar with the French designer instantly associates her with blunt-cut jet fringed hair, crimsonlips and a strict black and white wardrobe with an enticing bit of lingerie coyly on display. There may or may not be a corset in the mix, and a satin whip or feathered tickler might be tucked away somewhere in a tufted boudoir. The look is equal parts dominatrix and ''I can have it all'' workingwoman. This season, designers swung from one end of the style spectrum to the other: Gaultier and Dior had sultry sexpots flashing underwear as outerwear, while Chanel and Jil Sander, among others, went back to nature with bucolic peasant garb and frocks with frayed edges. But for Thomass, this dichotomy is old hat. In fact, before the lingerie-baring shows she held from the 1970s until the mid-'90s, she was a bit of a flower child."

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Agyness Deyn is the latest model trying to make the transition to acting, but she's doing it via the art gallery rather than Hollywood. In ''Mean to Me,'' a visually sumptuous 12-minute film noir written and directed by David McDermott and Peter McGough, Deyn trades her gamine look for raven-hued finger waves and crimson lips -- all the better to deliver a blow to the head of her lover (the ''Law & Order'' star Linus Roache), wrestle him into the bathtub, tie him up and extort a sizable check. Set in the Great Depression and named for a popular song of the era, the artist duo's first scripted film chronicles the disastrous end of an affair. McDermott and McGough began collaborating 30 years ago, and capturing the essence of a time past has always been part of their work, so recreating the 1930s proved no challenge. Period-perfect down to its wallpaper, telephone and radio, McGough's Art Deco Manhattan apartment provided the set. Deyn's costumes, by Zac Posen, might as well be of that vintage. The Shalimar perfume and pearls, around which crucial plot points turn, were courtesy of Guerlain and Mikimoto, which underwrote the project. Deyn got the gig at the suggestion of McGough's pal Louie Chaban, director of Women Management. ''Peter asked for a girl who wanted to act,'' Chaban says. And can she? McGough proclaims: ''A star is born.'' Jean Nathan"

Ms. Wexler was educated at the Universities of Miami, Pittsburgh, and Rome. As a young woman, she worked as a reporter and editor in New York and Europe, serving as the first American woman correspondent in Germany (Stars & Stripes) after the 1945 liberation of Berlin.

I like things that are already worn in, something tactile that's going to be comfortable on your skin. When I was working on the collection, I showed it to my daughter, but she's a bit -- you know. She just said, ''Yeah, it's all right.'' She prefers bling and Hello Kitty. She says she doesn't like Hello Kitty anymore, but I know she really does. I mean, I love it, too.

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"ALL-NIGHTERS To combat our ''culture of exhaustion,'' Americans spend nearly $24 billion a year on sleep-related goods and services, buying $5,000 mattresses, 600-thread count sheets and high-end sound machines that simulate the surf or chirping birds. By 2012, the market for insomnia drugs is expected to grow 78 percent, to nearly $3.9 billion. But with sleeping pills what are we really getting? They provide only an additional 11.4 minutes of sleep over placebo pills, and they interfere with memory formation, with the result that people sometimes forget how badly they actually slept. Some sleep doctors say if people perceive their sleep is better, they'll feel better. But that strikes me as ''Alice in Wonderland'' logic: ''I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?'

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"Vampires are so last decade -- these days, it's all about monsters. At the center of this scary trend is Lady Gaga, whose stage performances feature ''Thriller'' -style choreography and ghoulish costume changes. (Even Filipino prisoners helped push the trend with their famous YouTube video.) Alexander McQueen, who has cited Lady Gaga as an influence, recently showed an otherworldly collection accented with prosthetic makeup and podlike 10-inch reptilian platforms. Gareth Pugh also unleashed a legion of threatening, heavily powdered models in a broodingly romantic zombie romp, and Lanvin's disturbing new ad campaign stars the photographers Vinoodh Matadin and Inez van Lamsweerde -- the latter in full-body makeup that makes her look as if she's been skinned alive. Perhaps the house should consider a partnership with the jewelry designer Emily Miranda, whose chunky pieces feature flesh-ripping animal claws. The film world is also right on trend. Spike Jonze got things going with ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' which was followed by remakes of ''The Wolfman'' and, in theaters soon, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street.'' Natalie Portman has signed on for ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,'' and Tim Burton's dark directorial oeuvre is being celebrated in a career retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art through April 26. From a pop-psych perspective, this macabre obsession reads as a projection of the collective anxiety we're dealing with, given a glossy sheen to make it less scary. Wouldn't it be nice if instead of financial crises and terrorist attacks, all we had to worry about were things that go bump in the night?"

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"HOVEY--Graham. After a long career of covering world affairs in the United States and abroad for newspapers, wire services and public radio, Graham Hovey joined The New York Times in 1965, serving on its editorial board for more than 12 years, then working in its Washington Bureau as a foreign-policy reporter until September of 1980. Mr. Hovey passed away Saturday, February 20, 2010 in the Luther Crest community in Allentown, PA. He retired from The Times in 1980 to become professor of communications at the University of Michigan and director of Michigan Journalism Fellows, a program that provides an academic year of study and research for journalists at or near mid-career. After his official retirement at 70 in 1986, Hovey remained at Michigan as a professor emeritus to teach a first-year seminar on ""The Making of U.S. Foreign Policy."" He and his wife, Mary Jean, moved in 1998 to the Luther Crest retirement community in Allentown, PA to be nearer their son, Thomas D. Hovey. Hovey attended what is now the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, but transferred to the University of Minnesota, where he became assistant city editor of the Minnesota Daily and took his BA in journalism and economics in 1939. After two years as a reporter on the Waterloo Daily Courier in Iowa, he joined the International News Service (INS) bureau in Detroit in 1940 and covered the beginnings of the conversion of Detroit-area industries for war production. Hovey became a full-time sports writer for INS in Chicago in October, 1941. He was covering an intra-city football game in Comiskey Park between the Bears and the Cardinals when he learned of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. This effectively ended Hovey's sports-writing career for he moved to the INS cable desk in New York in March, 1942, and sailed for Africa in May as an INS war correspondent. Hovey left INS late in 1944 to become a foreign-affairs reporter for the Associated Press in Washington. Two years later he joined the New Republic as an assistant editor. But in 1947 he changed course to pursue an MA in political science and history and teach journalism at the University of Minnesota. He moved in 1949 to the University of Wisconsin, where he rose to the rank of associate professor. He also broadcast a weekly program called ""The Background of the News"" over the university radio station WHA and nine affiliated stations of the Wisconsin State Broadcasting Service. In 1953, Hovey took leave from Wisconsin to accept a two-year Fulbright grant to Italy, where he was accredited to Radiotelevisione Italiana and broadcast a weekly ""Letter from Italy"" for member stations of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, a forerunner of National Public Radio. He returned to Wisconsin for the 1955-56 academic year, then joined the editorial page staff of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, since merged as the Star Tribune. But he also covered international crises at the United Nations, winning the Overseas Press Club of America award for ""Best American Press Interpretation of Foreign Affairs"" and sharing a National Headliners Club award for his U.N. coverage in 1958. He was then sent to London in January, 1959, as the Minneapolis Tribune's first European Correspondent. After nearly seven years of covering NATO, the evolution of the European Common Market and Community and recurring crises with the Soviet Union over Berlin, Hovey accepted an invitation from John B. Oakes to join the editorial board of The New York Times in 1965. He wrote editorial and occasional signed columns on U.S. policies in Europe, Africa and the Americas, and often visited those areas. Hovey was married June 20, 1941, in Waterloo, Iowa, to Mary Jean Landgraf, a graduate of Columbia University's School of Library Science, who worked in libraries in Iowa, New Jersey, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington, DC, in addition to serving as her husband's researcher for writing and lectures. She survives along with their son, Thomas D. Hovey, his wife, Barbara A. of Forty Fort, PA; three grandchildren, Attorney Matthew T. Hovey of Pottstown, PA, Carolyn B. Hovey of Forty Fort, David L. Hovey of Forty Fort. Also surviving are two nieces, Marjorie Eger of Indiana and Lois Schmoe of Florida. Services: Private at the convenience of the family. Services by Stephens Funeral Home, Inc.

In time, they landed jobs as designers, photographers, display directors, makeup artists, hairdressers, stylists, editors, arbiters. Brilliant but not atypical was Ara Gallant, né Ira Gallantz. He fled the family's Bronx beauty parlor and worked as a hairstylist on photo shoots before becoming a photographer himself.

Take the Nya Berlin, a 1920s sofa designed for that city's Swedish embassy by the modernist Carl Malmsten. Johansson stretched and contorted the sofa's no-nonsense curves to arrive at five new variations, built in the south of Sweden and upholstered in cupcake shades of denim. Johansson says of his latest release: ''I have all these architect and designer friends who are inspired by fashion. I thought, Why not look at it the other way around?'' Jill Singer"

2010-02-28T00:00:00Z,"With two wars on and a recent surge, military flourishes were all but axiomatic on the spring runways, leaving unenlisted designers looking less like conscientious objectors than ostriches in a state of denial. Balmain's Christophe Decarnin led the charge with camouflage patchwork smothered in gold sequins; Haider Ackermann had cargo pants and epaulet-tipped jackets in washed leather. Of course, this is all just a little bit of history repeating itself. In 19th-century Europe, women's wardrobes took on a military flavor thanks to the Napoleonic wars. Cavalry regiments loved passementerie -- and soon so did the ladies, who heaped braids, tassels and knots on hats, bodices and spencers. When World War II came around, Mainbocher created a uniform for the Waves (Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service) that erased the line between service wear and civilian wear: stripped of their embellishments, the four-button jacket and six-gore skirt were intended as a day suit for peacetime."

Bronson (Luke Welch) spends some time explaining to his love interest that his entire life, including his decision to strap on a gun, has been a response to the humiliations visited on him because of his diminutive stature. Synopses of the movie on the Internet either do not mention this prominent aspect of the plot or touch on it only in passing, perhaps because it seems so much at odds with the figure Bronson cut (often semi-naked) in a series of famous movies - ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""Hard Times,"" ""Chato's Land,"" ""Mr. Majestyk"" and, of course, in what sometimes seemed to be a series of innumerable and increasingly violent ""Death Wish"" movies.Bronson is by no means the only action star whose larger than life screen persona was or is at odds with his ""real-life"" statistics. (Just what those statistics are is often debated on Web sites where there may be a three-inch variation in the height assigned to a particular actor.) The pattern was set in the 1930s and '40s by Edward G. Robinson (""Little Caesar""), James Cagney, George Raft, Humphrey Bogart and Paul Muni - all small men who usually played tough and cruel. Sometimes camera angles obscured the physical facts -"

National Review's Rich Lowry flirted with a bid for New York mayor in 2001, and there was a brief ""Lawrence Lessig for Congress"" boomlet in 2008, but both Lowry and Lessig ultimately decided against running. And there's certainly no current American equivalent of Britain's Boris Johnson, the magazine-editor-turned-Tory M.P.-turned-Mayor-of-London - or Michael Ignatieff, the historian, essayist and academic who's now the leader of Canada's Liberal Party."

Though he said he was too busy finishing his movie ""Black Swan"" to pay attention to the Oscar machinations this season (he did vote, however), the director Darren Aronofsky recently clued the Bagger into what he went through when he was promoting ""The Wrestler"" last year. ""There was some Web sites spreading this thing about how a hundred people had walked out of a screening because of the violence,"" Mr. Aronofsky said. ""Maybe that happened, I have no idea. What people told me is it didn't happen, or like three people walked out and they were all over 70 or something, which is understandable because the film was very violent. But it got picked up and spread around."""

This limited-edition tote ($98) by Tommy Hilfiger celebrates the just-opened 2010 Whitney Biennial and highlights the work of one of its artists, Ari Marcopoulos. A New York photographer of Dutch extraction and a former assistant to Andy Warhol, Marcopoulos is known for the great lengths he'll go to to get a picture, whether it's shadowing the Beastie Boys or chasing snowboarders down the Alps. The image on this tote bag comes from ""Detroit,"" Marcopoulos's video piece in the Biennial, about two boys who make electronic music in a small Detroit bedroom using little more than foot effect pedals. Marcopoulos was given an advance copy of the bag, which went on sale Thursday, and he approved of it. ""I thought it was going to be a really cheap tote bag,"" he said. ""But it's functional.

2010-03-02T00:00:00Z,"JAFFE--Andrew, a noted foreign correspondent for Newsweek, editor of Adweek Magazine, head of the international advertising Clio Awards, and finally a consultant to the advertising and marketing industries, died today after a courageous ten year battle with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. He was 71. Fresh out of Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Jaffe began his career as a newsman for the Associated Press where he won notice for his coverage of the 1965 Watts Riot. He then joined Newsweek Magazine, first as a domestic correspondent in Atlanta covering race relations, and then in 1969 as a correspondent and later bureau chief for its Africa bureau in Nairobi, Kenya. While there, he covered the Biafran civil war, the end of Haile Selassie's rule as emperor of Ethiopia, and Idi Amin's rule in Uganda, as well as the end of Portuguese colonialism in Mozambique and Angola. In 1975 he accepted a post back in the U.S. as bureau chief in Miami. He left Newsweek in 1977 to become business editor for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. In 1984, he set off for New York, where he worked as marketing director of the international travel firm, Special Expeditions. In 1986 he was hired by Adweek Magazine as editor of a regional edition based in Atlanta. And in 1988, he moved to New York to become editorial director of the magazine's six editions. Jaffe spent the next 15 years immersed in advertising. In 1992 he was made a vice president of Adweek responsible for starting Adweek Conferences and other brand extensions; and, in 1997, he managed its acquisition of the Clio Awards. He headed the Clios for the next six years, until he retired from the company in 2003 and set up his own consultancy in Norwalk, Connecticut. Before going to Columbia Journalism, Jaffe was a student at Phillips Exeter Academy and then Pomona College. From 1960-1962 he served on active duty in the U.S. Army in Korea and Alaska, with the rank of First Lieutenant. Opening his own consultancy, Compass Consulting, in 2003, he worked for various New York agencies and for the One Club, helping it introduce the first awards show for branded entertainment, One Show Entertainment. He also served on the board of the Brandcenter, a graduate program at Virginia Commonwealth University that offers a masters degree in the creative side of advertising. As a board member, he helped establish its executive education program for mid-career professionals. In 2003, he authored a book, ""Casting for Big Ideas,"" published by John Wiley & Co. Jaffe was a member of the Cornell Club, the American Society of Magazine Editors and the Overseas Press Club. He was chairman of the Neal Awards program, sponsored by American Business Media to recognize excellence in business-to-business journalism. His hobbies included fly fishing, travel and experiments with fiery cooking recipes. Jaffe was married to communications executive Eileen Ast in 1994. Their home is in New Canaan, Connecticut. Jaffe is survived by his wife, his son, Christopher, a computer executive, Chris' wife Katie and a granddaughter, Stella, all of whom live in Burlingame, California; a stepson, Nicholas Ast, a student at Eckerd College; and two brothers, Steve, a crisis PR expert in Beverly Hills, and Bruce, a computer specialist and photographer in New York City. The family requests that in his memory people consider a charitable contribution to the Andrew Jaffe Scholarship Fund at the Brandcenter, Virginia Commonwealth University or to the Whittingham Cancer Center at Norwalk Hospital. Memorial services are pending."

2010-03-02T00:00:00Z,"FAIL--James M.,was a true southern gentleman who never met a challenge that did not excite him or an adventure that did not inspire him. He was a successful businessman and a generous philanthropist. Most recently, he served as the chairman of Stone Holdings, his Dallas-based financial holding company. A native of Mobile, Alabama, he attended Murphy High School and served three years in the U.S. Navy before graduating from the University of Alabama in 1949. His lifelong respect for education manifested itself in his numerous gifts to both educational facilities and individuals, including his establishing a scholarship at Birmingham Southern College for ""any worthy and deserving student."" This reiterated his belief that education was the greatest gift he could offer. In 2009, he was honored by the University of the South at Sewanee with a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa. James' love for music began at a young age with the violin, viola, and trombone. He played in the Murphy High School band and continued to enjoy performing with the Woody Herman Big Band and the Swingles in the 1940s. Later, he was a generous supporter of the Phoenix Symphony, serving as director, and the Mobile Symphony; making a sizable donation endowing its principal cello chair in memory of his wife. His great enthusiasm for sports lead him to repeatedly give to the Crimson Tide Foundation. His first donation enabled the University to build the department's media suite, named for his father- in-law, Naylor Stone, whom he greatly admired. In 2008, much to his delight and befitting his wonderful sense of humor, the University of Alabama found a way to thank him for his ongoing support by naming the visitor's room at Bryant-Denny Stadium ""The Fail Room."" He gained a great deal of joy from making the long journey to Pasadena this January to see the Crimson Tide win the National Championship. James' adventurous and always curious nature led him to make many great trips around the world. He took great joy in bringing his family and friends with him to share the experiences of faraway lands and new cultures; stories of these trips always entertained and inspired those around him. Mr. Fail was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, the Economic Club of New York and a founder of its Centennial Society, the Metropolitan Club of New York, Phoenix Country Club, the Summit Club, The Inverness Country Club, The Club of Birmingham, and The Noah Society. He attended St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands Episcopal Church. James was preceded in death by his wife, Emily Stone Fail; his son, James Naylor Fail; and his parents, Joe and Rosalie Fail. He is survived by his daughters Kathryn Luttrull and Marcia Boykin, both of Phoenix, Arizona; his grandchildren Lindsay, Hayley, Bobby, Marbury, Liza, Grey, Coulter, and Malcolm; his great-grandchildren Stone, Jonas, and Dahlia; brothers Alton and Charles Fail, and a large extended family. Throughout his successes, James Fail never lost his humility and maintained his generosity to a fault. With his beloved wife Emily, he was a shining example of how to live a rich and joyful life. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the University of Alabama general scholarship fund or St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands.Visitation will be held Wednesday, March 3, 2010 from 6pm until 8pm at Johns-Ridout's Southside. A funeral service will be held on Thursday, March 4, 2010 at 11am at St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands, with burial to follow at Elmwood Cemetery.

The Wisconsin congressman, you may recall, accused partisans of the pending legislation of disguising the real cost of the bill, which may total $2.3 trillion over 10 years once all the subsidies are phased in. Klein responded that yes, ""the bill might cost $2.3 trillion"" in its second decade, but over that period ""it either raises or saves $2.95 trillion, for a net deficit impact of negative $650 billion."" Ryan, he suggested, was using ""the classic 'This Is A Big Number' technique to imply that the bill is financially irresponsible, when putting the number in context would show just the opposite."""

2010-03-03T17:47:44Z,"""I am cursed to be in this Mother Hubbard body,"" Alice Neel once remarked of her grandmotherly image. The artist's sensitivity to nuances of style and gesture informs the portraits in ""Alice Neel: Painted Truths,"" a retrospective opening on March 21 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Since her portrait work was largely uncommissioned and did not require that she flatter the sitter, ""you get a sense of how people really looked,"" says Barry Walker, who, with Jeremy Lewison, curated the show. That's as true for the cheerful Fuller Brush man and Dachau survivor who showed up on her doorstep in 1965 as it is for the art-world elites who (eventually) posed for her - including the Factory's Ritta Redd and Jackie Curtis and Andy Warhol himself, seminude and scarred. (Neel was notorious for sweet-talking her subjects out of their clothes.) When faced with truly stylish subjects, like the art-world players John Gruen and Jane Wilson and their daughter, Neel focused on the psychological - the self-assured couple and the young girl, hunched like a figure out of Munch - but she didn't neglect the clothes. The painting's pet name: ""Six Patent Leather Shoes."""

They're just so classic, really - I've got clutches from the '30s, in that envelope style that's really simple and not too overdone. This one is part of the collection that I just designed for Longchamp, and you can actually stuff a load of things in it and bash it around. The leather is textured to look like shagreen, which I love. Most bags are too heavy to carry things in, and so many of them are stiff, and you know it's going to take years to mess them up. I like things that are already worn in, something tactile that's going to be comfortable on your skin. When I was working on the collection, I showed it to my daughter, but she's a bit - you know. She just said, ""Yeah, it's all right."" She prefers bling and Hello Kitty. She says she doesn't like Hello Kitty anymore, but I know she really does. I mean, I love it, too. I just nabbed her Hello Kitty makeup bag, in fact. What can I say? I like a mismatch. - As told to Alexandra Marshall"

Paul Johnson of Johnson Trading, a design gallery on Greenwich Street, just opened a show called ""Home"" in the Chrystie Street loft he calls, well, his home. The subject of the show is the self-taught 60-something outsider artist Robert Loughlin. Loughlin spent most of his life being a picker (or chineur), one of those people scouring flea markets looking for rare resalable gems among the rummage - always in the hopes of ""selling Andy Warhol a cookie jar,"" as the writer Irwin Warren put it in his foreword for the show's program. Johnson started out as a picker himself, and about 10 years ago he began buying pieces from the back of Loughlin's pickup truck at the old Chelsea flea market. His collection now comprises more than 500 pieces, from chairs, canvases, record covers, advertising posters and other bizarre objects - ivory teeth and baby seats - all scribbled on with Loughlin's Tom of Finland-esque signature smoking head, obsessively filling every single one of the loft's 4,500 square feet. To this day, Loughlin still peddles his pieces (for $300 and up) at the Chelsea flea market, but it is unlikely anybody will ever be able to accumulate a collection of similar size or quality as Johnson's (not to mention as elegantly hung by the decorator to the stars Ricky Clifton). ""I definitely have enough now, and I don't have any more space in my house,"" says Johnson when asked whether he'll continue collecting Loughlin. He pauses, before adding ""Unless it's really good."""

Sonoma will be the first county in the Bay Area to participate in the department's ""Secure Communities"" program. Critics say the program gives local law enforcement officials a bigger role in immigration enforcement, which is conducted by the federal government. The program, which began in late 2008, is now used in 10 California counties, including Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego. ""This is a common-sense approach: Everyone who gets arrested gets checked for immigration status,"" said Matt McCaffrey, a sheriff's captain. ""In this case, they're already in the system for entering into the country illegally or for having a record."" Separately, a United States district court judge will hold a hearing on Wednesday in Oakland on a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, accusing the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office of routinely holding Latinos longer than the maximum 72 hours for immigration detention.

2010-03-03T00:00:00Z,"STEERS--Patricia Katherine, known to her friends as PK, died peacefully at her home in New York City on February 12 attended by close friends. She had led a long and enriching life in the arts both as a performer and an educator, initially as a ballerina with the New York City Ballet, which she joined in the early 50's. Within a few years, she was assigned soloist roles and appeared in many Balanchine and Robbins works. With the blessing of Balanchine, she joined the Paris Opera Ballet as a guest artist for a season. After leaving the New York City Ballet, she danced with Bill Carter as his partner in his Dance Ensemble company, touring in the United States and Italy. She also appeared in dancing roles in the Hollywood films Oklahoma, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and The Joker's Wild. In a departure from her performing career, she attended Yale University where in 1987 she earned a graduate degree in architecture. Her experience as a dancer in space relationships, lighting, and set and costume design served her well. Later, she designed spaces for private clients. In 1990, she joined the Regis High School faculty as a teacher in the fine arts department conducting classes in Studio Art and Architectural Design. She also served on design juries and as a guest lecturer at Yale University and the New York School of Interior Design. Her husband J. Rich Steers predeceased her in 2000. She is survived by her brother Sean McGrath and stepsons James, George, Philip and Robert Steers. Her friends have been deeply impressed by her many accomplishments, generosity, and enviable, unflagging drive despite very compromising health problems in her later years. A memorial Mass and service will be held at Regis High School on March 5 at 9am."

2010-03-03T00:00:00Z,"FAIL--James M.,was a true southern gentleman who never met a challenge that did not excite him or an adventure that did not inspire him. He was a successful businessman and a generous philanthropist. Most recently, he served as the chairman of Stone Holdings, his Dallas-based financial holding company. A native of Mobile, Alabama, he attended Murphy High School and served three years in the U.S. Navy before graduating from the University of Alabama in 1949. His lifelong respect for education manifested itself in his numerous gifts to both educational facilities and individuals, including his establishing a scholarship at Birmingham Southern College for ""any worthy and deserving student."" This reiterated his belief that education was the greatest gift he could offer. In 2009, he was honored by the University of the South at Sewanee with a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa. James' love for music began at a young age with the violin, viola, and trombone. He played in the Murphy High School band and continued to enjoy performing with the Woody Herman Big Band and the Swingles in the 1940s. Later, he was a generous supporter of the Phoenix Symphony, serving as director, and the Mobile Symphony; making a sizable donation endowing its principal cello chair in memory of his wife. His great enthusiasm for sports lead him to repeatedly give to the Crimson Tide Foundation. His first donation enabled the University to build the department's media suite, named for his father- in-law, Naylor Stone, whom he greatly admired. In 2008, much to his delight and befitting his wonderful sense of humor, the University of Alabama found a way to thank him for his ongoing support by naming the visitor's room at Bryant-Denny Stadium ""The Fail Room."" He gained a great deal of joy from making the long journey to Pasadena this January to see the Crimson Tide win the National Championship. James' adventurous and always curious nature led him to make many great trips around the world. He took great joy in bringing his family and friends with him to share the experiences of faraway lands and new cultures; stories of these trips always entertained and inspired those around him. Mr. Fail was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, the Economic Club of New York and a founder of its Centennial Society, the Metropolitan Club of New York, Phoenix Country Club, the Summit Club, The Inverness Country Club, The Club of Birmingham, and The Noah Society. He attended St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands Episcopal Church. James was preceded in death by his wife, Emily Stone Fail; his son, James Naylor Fail; and his parents, Joe and Rosalie Fail. He is survived by his daughters Kathryn Luttrull and Marcia Boykin, both of Phoenix, Arizona; his grandchildren Lindsay, Hayley, Bobby, Marbury, Liza, Grey, Coulter, and Malcolm; his great-grandchildren Stone, Jonas, and Dahlia; brothers Alton and Charles Fail, and a large extended family. Throughout his successes, James Fail never lost his humility and maintained his generosity to a fault. With his beloved wife Emily, he was a shining example of how to live a rich and joyful life. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the University of Alabama general scholarship fund or St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands.Visitation will be held Wednesday, March 3, 2010 from 6pm until 8pm at Johns-Ridout's Southside.

2010-03-04T11:20:52Z,"Why is there no Jewish Narnia? That's the provocative question raised by Michael Weingrad's essay on Judaism and fantasy novels, published in the inaugural issue of the Jewish Review of Books.  Note that Weingrad is talking about fantasy as a genre, not the use of the fantastic as a literary tool. (So the existence of Kafka and Isaac Bashevis Singer does not disprove his thesis.) And note, as well, that the piece is not entitled ""Why Are There No Jewish Fantasy Novelists?"" To the extent that Weingrad raises that question, he's pretty easily refuted. But really he's raising a deeper issue, one that goes to the nature of the genre itself: ""Why are there no works of modern fantasy that are profoundly Jewish in the way that, say, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' is Christian? Why no Jewish [C.S.] Lewises, and why no Jewish Narnias?"""

In recent years, older and more mature, he has been captivated by images of the future, sometimes blending them with the past. Along the way he established separate lines, for knits, silks and limited editions, that helped to make Balenciaga profitable, but when it comes to the collections he presents in Paris, there has almost always been a sense of a designer free to create. That was again the invigorating experience this morning at the Hôtel de Crillon, on a specially installed white laboratory floor, where Mr. Ghesquiere showed a highly textured collection that looked well beyond the fall of 2010."

The hurdles are many, with one of the biggest simply finding ways to acquire broad stretches of land that can accommodate the wandering species. Another is consolidating a maze of local, state and federal policies that treat the animals in different ways. Many Western states, for instance, classify bison as livestock and not wildlife, the report authors say, hampering how they can be managed in the wild. Here's the full report on restoring bison. (The video above is courtesy of the Wildlife Conservation Society.)"

She will be remembered by all who knew her as a persistent advocate for social services for children and youth, an expert on adoption and foster care issues, an independent woman of intellect who always followed her heart, and as a beautiful person, inside and out, devoted to family and friends. She was a kind and selfless person, beloved by all she met. Her remarkable marriage to Chicago business and civic leader Ben W. Heineman Sr. lasted nearly 75 years. She is survived by her beloved husband Ben, her daughter Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper (Dr. William Pieper) of Chicago and her son Ben W.

Natalie Goldstein was born on March 16, 1913, on the south side of Chicago and lived in the city throughout her life. She graduated from the University of Chicago and did graduate work there before becoming a medical social worker. Ben and Natalie married on April 17, 1935, and she went on to lead many local and national civic and charitable organizations. She became the first woman president of the Chicago Child Care Society in 1966 and later the president of the Child Welfare League of America, which named a national award for outstanding service to children in her honor. She was one of the first women on the United Way of America national board. Other local service included the Citizens' Committee of the Juvenile Court of Cook County; the visiting committee of the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, and the board of the Erikson Institute for Early Childhood Education. Natalie was an intrepid family photographer, a lover of opera and symphony, and an avid studio glass collector with her husband Ben. In 2006, they donated their renowned collection to the Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, NY. The family would like to thank Dr. Neil Stone for his devotion and care.

2010-03-04T00:00:00Z,"Engineering and structural-repair professionals say it is relatively easy to spot foundation problems in structures that are more than 10 years old. If you are considering buying a house, look for patched-over cracks in brick or drywall and doors that have been planed. Also notice if there are cracks in sidewalks and streets in the neighborhood. In newer developments, it's harder to know if the homes will withstand a shift in soil. Therefore, it might be a good idea to have a geotechnical engineer do an inspection -- in addition to having a normal home inspection -- before you buy. Home inspectors may not have the expertise to assess soil conditions. (Licensed professionals can be found at the Web site of the Associated Soil and Foundation Engineers, asfe.org)"

2010-03-04T00:00:00Z,"I am a business owner with about 95 employees. I am trying to find the logic in the Senate jobs bill. You either need to hire someone or you don't. I can't imagine a company hiring someone because it is going to save on FICA, but for the sake of argument, let's say that lots of companies do just that. The proposed legislation also stipulates that the companies will get the tax break only if they hire workers who have been unemployed for at least 60 days. This stipulation encourages companies to violate the most basic tenet of good business, which is to hire the most qualified people. If in an effort to get the FICA break, companies pass over more qualified candidates who are guilty of being employed or of not being unemployed long enough, the government will have invented a whole new category of hiring discrimination."

The new $330 Optio W90 looks like it belongs on a mountainside (thanks to its included carabiner) and feels more solidly built than its predecessor, the Optio W80. The new Optio can snap photos in water down to 20 feet (the W80 could take photos at 16 feet). The company says it can withstand falls up to four feet (versus 3.3 feet for the W80), and can operate in temperatures as cold as 14 degrees Fahrenheit (this is the rated low temperature for most rugged cameras). Like the W80, the W90 has a resolution of 12.1 megapixels and a 28-to-140mm (equivalent) lens with 5X optical zoom. It can capture 720p high-definition video at 30 frames per second."

""Avatar"" would be the first sci-fi movie to win best picture (ditto ""District 9,"" although it won't). But with the extra-long season, there's been time to dig up bits of information about Oscar newbies:"

General Motors announced this week they're recalling 1.3 million compact cars here in North America to address a power steering problem.

2010-03-05T13:28:34Z,"Monologue | Thursday night on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" on NBC: More crazy news from the car industry. An executive at G.M. is blaming his company's 1.3 million car recall on a parts supplier owned by Toyota. I'm just waiting for people to start blaming everything on Toyota. It's like the unemployment rate, the Kennedy assassination, global warming."
2010-03-05T13:25:20Z,"Monologue | Thursday night on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on ABC: There's a story today in the entertainment trade papers that Sarah Palin is shopping a reality show with the producer of ""Survivor"", Mark Burnett.

Luckily, I'm heading to Palm Springs, Calif., in a few weeks for some poolside lounging and vintage shopping. This Rachel Pally bathing suit from Anthropologie will be the perfect addition to my trip. It has a conservative cut so you don't reveal too much, and its vintage style conjures up an image of a soignée Babe Paley sitting by the pool with sunglasses on her head. Not bad for under $100."
2010-03-05T13:18:08Z,"""Haiti's Enduring Creativity"" (05:06)In Haiti, artwork has been ruined or lost. Artists have been killed and injured. Yet the creative spirit still flows. Sean Patrick Farrell and Erik Olsen visited with artists and musicians as they assessed the damage to their country's cultural legacy. Songs are already being sung about ""douze Janvier,"" as the proliferation of music underscores the importance of expression and creativity during this time: as a conduit of hope, a means to forget or a form of political protest. Amid images of an artist's mangled hand and an art school's crumbled paintings, an educator movingly declares, ""Much more today, we need art to survive."" (K.B.)"

2010-03-05T12:57:26Z,"One of the great challenges in assessing the meaning of changes in Arctic climate and other environmental conditions is putting today's observations in long-term context. This is as true for the bubbling emissions of methane from the frozen, but warming, sea bed as for sea ice around the North Pole. Two recent studies of methane emissions from frozen sea-bed sediments, including one published in Science and described in The Times today, found substantial bubbling flows of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, were reaching the atmosphere."
2010-03-05T12:50:12Z,"There's a spirit of bricolage running through this season, as if designers wanted their clothes to convey as many possibilities as possible. Why not, for example, give a sweater a fur sleeve, or a tailored jacket a knit shoulder? It's a trick we saw over and over both in Milan and New York, but it takes a remix master like Dries Van Noten to make such combinations seem purposeful rather than whimsical. Van Noten's men's-wear-inspired jackets came not just with contrasting sleeves, but with a '50s hourglass nipped waist; pastoral florals on ladylike dresses and skirts were treated with punky splashes of paint, which the designer described as ""rebel realist"" prints; neo-grunge sweatshirts happily coexisted with leopard print furs, rich brocades and military parkas reminiscent of the '70s."

One harried collector breathlessly arrived at Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery's booth asking for the price of Peter Coffin's Napoleonic sculpture. ($350,000 - and two of the three were already sold.) David Schnell's imposing landscape paintings were drawing a crowd of buyers at Berlin's Eigen Art. ""They're not crazy expensive and his work has progressed,"" explained a young collector, who pointed to a large 8 x 10 canvas that was apparently going in the low six figures. There was more solid work by artists like Sean Landers, Mickalene Thomas and Josephine Meckseper."

2010-03-05T11:43:54Z,"The Columbus Symphony Orchestra has taken drastic action to stay in business. It said on Friday that it had lopped off 13 weeks of its season, translating into a 23-percent pay cut for its musicians and $1.5 million reduction of its $9 million budget next year. Its season will now run for 25 weeks instead of 38. The orchestra said that its reduction, which was negotiated with the musicians, will eliminate three paid weeks of vacation for the players, five weeks of playing for BalletMet and Opera Columbus performances; and five weeks of special one-off concerts. Subscription concerts will be preserved, the orchestra said. The Columbus Symphony, a high-quality regional orchestra in Ohio's capital, has been struggling financially for several years. The cutbacks are a particularly draconian example of trimming going on around the orchestra world amid the recession."

2010-03-05T00:00:00Z,"It is a rare day when an N.F.L. starting quarterback is released, but the Carolina Panthers are expected to send Jake Delhomme packing Friday, taking advantage of the lack of a salary cap to dump a player they gave an ill-advised contract extension to just a year ago. The Panthers still owe Delhomme almost $13 million. The decision was first reported by Fox Sports. Delhomme led the Panthers to a Super Bowl berth and two N.F.C. championship games. But the decision to give him a contract extension after he had six turnovers in a playoff game against the Cardinals at the end of the 2008 season was heavily criticized. He continued to decline last season, when he threw 18 interceptions and just 8 touchdowns. He broke a finger in December and missed the final five games of the season, which opened the door for the Panthers to replace him with Matt Moore. The Panthers gave Moore the highest tender, an early sign that the Panthers were prepared to move on. JUDY BATTISTA"

2010-03-07T00:00:00Z,"IN the depths of a New York City winter, it's easy to forget what tropical warmth really feels like -- that close, comforting pressure on your bare skin, the humid aroma of vegetal growth and decay, the way vistas both urban and pastoral seem to shimmer, sigh and relax in the heat. You can remember these things, sure, but they seem abstract -- faded dreams from another life. Until, that is, you find a cheap flight down south and plan a one-day escape from the frigid slush. Even with airfares edging back up, deals are still plentiful for those with a little flexibility. So, a couple of weeks ago, when I spotted a Delta Airlines flight for $189 (taxes and fees included) that would take me to Miami in the morning and return that very evening, I snatched it. In between, I would have about nine hours to soak up as much of that city's sockless, pastel culture as I could afford on a budget of, as usual, close to nothing."

Phoebe Philo -- of course -- initiated the shift with a resort collection for Céline made up of, as she described it, clothing women need in their wardrobe. Turns out, they were ravenous for it. At Chloé, Hannah MacGibbon has given the pared-down aesthetic her own spin with long skirts and oversize blazers.

Since 2001, she has taken regular trips back to photograph its people.

She was 71. Mrs. Stadler graduated from Antioch College and received a Master's degree from Southern Connecticut State College. She taught in the New Rochelle school system for 45 years until her retirement in 2009. For most of that period, she taught or was based at Columbus School, focusing on special education in her early career and then on mathematics, teaching and coordinating at a district-wide level. Mrs. Stadler was deeply committed to the belief that all children can learn. Her approach reflected the belief that children make meaning through inquiry-based teaching and learning. She taught that through hands-on applications, critical thinking, and problem-based learning, children can be involved and understand at deeper levels. Towards that end she created a great many math games and puzzles. Her underlying faith nurtured the innate intelligence and curiosity of the children. Her favorite direction on math tests was ""show your work"". Mrs Stadler was an accomplished amateur watercolorist and a truly marvelous cook. The daughter of Elliott Maurice Kahn and Marjorie Untermeyer Kahn Sands, Mrs. Stadler was born on July 18, 1938, in New York City. Mrs. Stadler's survivors include her husband of 47 years, Dr. John B. Stadler; sister Julie Shubik (Martin) of New Haven; sons Daniel (Cynthia) of Norwich, Vermont, Alex (Andrew Baker) of Philadelphia, and David (Laura) of New York City; step-daughters Jenny Stadler Carlson (Steve) of Houston and Iyana Stadler (Ruth Fremont) of Philadelphia; stepson Eliot Stadler (Jody) of Minneapolis; grandchildren Henry and Lily Stadler, step-grandchildren Erin, Rita, Russell, and Zoe Carlson and Hannah and Jacob Stadler; niece Claire Shubik, a large extended family and many friends from her home, career and travels. A memorial service for Mrs. Stadler will be held at 4pm on March 27th at the Coveleigh Club (215 Stuyvesant Ave. Rye, NY 10580). In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to the Charlotte Stadler Fund at Columbus Elementary School (275 Washington Ave. New Rochelle, NY 10801)."

At the height of his creative powers and popularity, he decided to quit the stage while he was on top. Explaining that he was repeating himself and needed to do some growing up, he told The New Yorker, ''I've said enough as a young dramatist.'' He was 35."

BEHIND THE NEWS In Michigan, for instance, the parole rate is the highest in 16 years. But critics there and elsewhere say that often the wrong kinds of convicts -- violent criminals and sex offenders -- are being released, and are committing new crimes at alarming rates. Officials in some states said their prison cost-cutting efforts fell short when they found far fewer prisoners to be wise release risks."

2010-03-07T00:00:00Z,"ALL-NIGHTERS As Jorge Luis Borges observes in his poem ''Insomnia'': ''In vain do I await/ the disintegration, the symbols that come before sleep.'' My internal narrator, the one who is speaking in my head all day long, refuses to shut up. The day voice of the self-conscious thinker races along heedless of my desire to stop it and relax. Chaucer's narrator in ''The Book of the Duchess'' seems to have a similar problem: ''Suche fantasies ben in myn hede,/ So I not what is best to doo.'' And so, like many insomniacs before and after him, he picks up a book and begins to read. I was 13 when I had my first bout of insomnia. I couldn't sleep, and so I read, but the novels I was reading only stimulated me more, and I would find myself wandering around the house with rushing fragments of Dickens, Austen or the Brontës whirring in my head. It is tempting to think of this form of insomnia, the inability to fall asleep, as a disease of agency and control, the inability to relinquish high self-reflexive consciousness for the vulnerable, ignorant regions of slumber in which we know not what we do."

She will be remembered by all who knew her as a persistent advocate for social services for children and youth, an expert on adoption and foster care issues, an independent woman of intellect who always followed her heart, and as a beautiful person, inside and out, devoted to family and friends. She was a kind and selfless person, beloved by all she met. Her remarkable marriage to Chicago business and civic leader Ben W. Heineman Sr. lasted nearly 75 years. She is survived by her beloved husband Ben, her daughter Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper (Dr. William Pieper) of Chicago and her son Ben W. Heineman Jr. (Cristine Russell) of New Canaan, CT; grandchildren Thalia Field (Jamie Jewett and son Benjamin), Dr. Jessica Heineman-Pieper (Dr. Param Srikantia), Johanna Heineman-Pieper, Victoria Stein (Jotham and son Gershon), Zachary Heineman and Matthew Heineman; and many nieces, nephews and other relatives. Natalie Goldstein was born on March 16, 1913, on the south side of Chicago and lived in the city throughout her life. She graduated from the University of Chicago and did graduate work there before becoming a medical social worker. Ben and Natalie married on April 17, 1935, and she went on to lead many local and national civic and charitable organizations. She became the first woman president of the Chicago Child Care Society in 1966 and later the president of the Child Welfare League of America, which named a national award for outstanding service to children in her honor. She was one of the first women on the United Way of America national board. Other local service included the Citizens' Committee of the Juvenile Court of Cook County; the visiting committee of the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, and the board of the Erikson Institute for Early Childhood Education. Natalie was an intrepid family photographer, a lover of opera and symphony, and an avid studio glass collector with her husband Ben. In 2006, they donated their renowned collection to the Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, NY. The family would like to thank Dr. Neil Stone for his devotion and care. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to the Chicago Child Care Society, 5467 S. University Ave. Chicago, IL 60615. (773) 643-0452 or www.cccsociety.org.

It was the rainy season, so we had to complete huge counts by noon, because torrential downpours could roll in at a moment's notice in the afternoon. We counted coffee beans in our sleep at night.

The space is in Chelsea, but there's no cerebral conceptualism, cool abstraction or painterly gesture on view. Instead this work, variously labeled Lowbrow Art, Pop Surrealism and perhaps most accurately Pop Pluralism, is the skateboarding, graffiti-tagging, sometimes bratty and rebellious younger sibling of the art shown in most of the neighborhood's locations. Still, the art in the Jonathan LeVine Gallery seems at home in Chelsea in a way it did not five years ago. After years on the fringes of the art world, ''we've come to a turning point,'' Mr. LeVine said recently. ''The mainstream is embracing this work.''"

Jane Birkin was a fan. Catherine Deneuve bought them by the dozen. Yoko One made weekly trips to the Madison Avenue shop, and Lauren Bacall was so wild for the shirts, she'd head straight to the warehouse in Paris. ''She wanted to see all the colors,'' said Serge Azria, the chief executive and creative director of Current/Elliott who, with the blessing of Mr. Restoin, a close friend for 30 years, has now revived the label. Drawing from the archive of 3,500 shirts, the new collection includes original styles (a jersey military design remains the same) and updated variations (the signature silk button-up shirt now has front pockets and comes in an array of washed-out hues). Collectibles, all."

2010-03-07T00:00:00Z,"ON A WINTER DAY five years ago, Doug Lemov realized he had a problem. After a successful career as a teacher, a principal and a charter-school founder, he was working as a consultant, hired by troubled schools eager -- desperate, in some cases -- for Lemov to tell them what to do to get better. There was no shortage of prescriptions at the time for how to cure the poor performance that plagued so many American schools. Proponents of No Child Left Behind saw standardized testing as a solution. President Bush also championed a billion-dollar program to encourage schools to adopt reading curriculums with an emphasis on phonics. Others argued for smaller classes or more parental involvement or more state financing. Lemov himself pushed for data-driven programs that would diagnose individual students' strengths and weaknesses. But as he went from school to school that winter, he was getting the sinking feeling that there was something deeper he wasn't reaching. On that particular day, he made a depressing visit to a school in Syracuse, N.Y., that was like so many he'd seen before: ''a dispiriting exercise in good people failing,'' as he described it to me recently. Sometimes Lemov could diagnose problems as soon as he walked in the door. But not here. Student test scores had dipped so low that administrators worried the state might close down the school. But the teachers seemed to care about their students. They sat down with them on the floor to read and picked activities that should have engaged them. The classes were small. The school had rigorous academic standards and state-of-the-art curriculums and used a software program to analyze test results for each student, pinpointing which skills she still needed to work on."

James said the change would be made out of respect for Michael Jordan, who wore No. 23 for most of his career. (For a brief time after his return to basketball after a stint in the minor leagues Jordan wore No. 45.) This move is expected to take place at the beginning of next season, and there are many who feel that it is an indicator that he plans to resign with the Cavaliers. If he were to go to another team he could change his number without filing paperwork and waiting for league approval."

Passers-by can wander into the office and observe costume fittings, take part in scheduled discussions with members of the creative staff and even — if they are so inclined — learn about more mundane aspects of putting on a show, like sending out mailers and doing paperwork.”"

The South African artist directed the company's production of Shostakovich's early opera ""The Nose,"" which opened on Friday, and his sets and videos that animate the staging ""received the heartiest bravos."" The choice of Mr. Kentridge is another example of how Peter Gelb, the company's general manager, has made it a priority to recruit directors from theater and film. ""With Mr. Kentridge, whose work can now be seen in an extensive exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Gelb has brought in a major visual artist. Stop-action animation and theatrical design are central to Mr. Kentridge's work, and he has unleashed his imagination on Shostakovich's bitterly satirical and breathless opera."" The music is intriguing, too: ""you are not likely to hear a more insightful, ornery and, when appropriate, achingly poignant account of Shostakovich's still-shocking score than the performance the conductor Valery Gergiev drew from the Met orchestra and chorus and the large cast: some 30 artists, singing about 80 solo roles."" Tonight a lecture about the production will be held at the Opera house beginning at 6."

2010-03-08T00:00:00Z,"STADLER--Charlotte K.,71, a long-time schoolteacher and mathematics specialist in the New Rochelle School District, died in her sleep Saturday, February 27, at her home in Larchmont, two months after being diagnosed with acute leukemia. She was 71. Mrs. Stadler graduated from Antioch College and received a Master's degree from Southern Connecticut State College. She taught in the New Rochelle school system for 45 years until her retirement in 2009. For most of that period, she taught or was based at Columbus School, focusing on special education in her early career and then on mathematics, teaching and coordinating at a district-wide level. Mrs. Stadler was deeply committed to the belief that all children can learn. Her approach reflected the belief that children make meaning through inquiry-based teaching and learning. She taught that through hands-on applications, critical thinking, and problem-based learning, children can be involved and understand at deeper levels. Towards that end she created a great many math games and puzzles. Her underlying faith nurtured the innate intelligence and curiosity of the children.

The artist Reid Peppard makes ghoulish bow ties and pendants from an assortment of rodents and birds collected from the London streets by her cat, Panasonic, and other eagle-eyed friends. ""I get texts saying: 'I've just found a dead pigeon on Old Street,' "" says the 23 year-old Californian, whose beastly collections have names like Vermin, Park and Pet. ""It takes chutzpah to wear my work, so most of my customers are men."" Still, her creations have been commissioned for Lady Gaga, and the Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquière has posted her work on his Facebook page.

It was a lavish production, needless to say, with classic tweeds, cute knits and thick fur chaps dragged through the enormous wading pool by the models. All the fur, by the way, was fake. Any comment about climate change and melting ice caps was probably unintended. The Ice Hotel in Sweden provided inspiration. When asked backstage if he had ever visited the hotel, Mr. Lagerfeld, dressed in a Dior peacoat and bleached jeans with a vintage Cartier stickpin in his black tie, shivered and said no."

He's the inventor of Phenomen'eyes, that mold-breaking mascara with the mace-like, spiked applicator. He travels in very arty circles, and I bet he brings the house down wherever he goes. Women love him. Men love him, too. It's because he talks to people, not at them. He also listens, makes eye contact, smiles. He's unaffected, un-jaded, un-snobby.

2010-03-09T00:00:00Z,"SINGH--Dr. Sadanand, 76, died February 27, 2010, in La Jolla, California. A noted scholar, academic, educator author, entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr. Sadanand Singh led an amazingly fruitful life that helped to shape and influence countless numbers of people across the United States and around the world. Dr. Singh was born in 1934 in a small agricultural village without electricity or running water in the state of Bihar in northern India. Though predestined to become a farmer, Dr. Singh followed a different path shaped by his love of the written word and the desire to educate. He left his remote home to become the first member of his family to earn a college degree. He went on to receive his Master's of Literature from India's Bihar University, in 1958, followed by a Ph.D. in Aesthetics from India's Ranchi University, in 1963. His developing reputation as a scholar reached far beyond Indian borders, leading to an invitation from Ohio State University to join its faculty. He moved to America to accept the position, and in 1965 earned his second doctorate, in Speech and Hearing Science. He joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, DC, in 1967 as a professor and department head, but he returned to Ohio to become Professor of Hearing and Speech Sciences at Ohio University, from 1969 to 1971. This was followed by a position of Professor and Director of the Speech and Hearing Laboratory at the University of Texas in Houston and remained there until 1980, when he became professor and chairman of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at San Diego State University. Among his most treasured roles was that of author. His scholarly work has helped shape the field of speech and hearing, with numerous works including a notable treatise on phonetics, now in its third edition. His success as an author and editor led him into his next career -- that of publisher. In 1980, he and his wife, Kala, an audiologist herself, founded College Hill Press. College Hill became one of the most influential publishing companies in the speech and hearing sciences, with more than 250 titles in print. It was subsequently acquired in 1986 by Time Inc. through its subsidiary Little, Brown & Company of Boston. Tragedy struck the Singhs in 1986. While returning from a family visit to India, Kala Singh was killed during the attempted hijacking of Pan Am flight 73. Dr. Singh and their two young children were seriously injured. While recuperating from the traumatic and harrowing experience, Dr. Singh wrote two manuscripts that remain unpublished. Several years later, he rebounded and married Angie in 1990. Together, they created Singular Publishing Group. Eight years later, Singular had more than 350 titles and seven journals in print. Dr. Singh attempted retirement in 1999, when Singular was acquired by Thomson Delmar (now Delmar Cengage). However, instead of resting on his already notable laurels, he founded ContentScan. The Internet-based literature search program was later acquired by Cambridge Information Group. In 2004, he and his wife, Angie, founded Plural Publishing, which today has a vibrant and growing list of titles in speech, language, voice disorders, swallowing disorders, singing, otolaryngology and audiology. During his many careers, Dr. Singh received a wealth of professional awards and recognitions. A partial list includes three honorary degrees, honorary Phi Beta Kappa membership, the Wilber Gould Highest Honors award from the American Voice Foundation and the Distinguished Services Award from the Council of Graduate Programs in Communication Services and Disorders. In 2004, San Diego State University honored him with the endowed Sadanand Singh Professorship in Communication Sciences and Disorders. And in 2006, he received the Honors of the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association -- the professional association's rarely bestowed highest award -- as well as the Lybarger Award, the highest honor of the American Academy of Audiology. Dr. Sadanand Singh had not only a brilliant mind; he also had a huge heart. Family was at the forefront of his priorities. Despite the distance of miles, he and his brothers spoke daily. He spent much of his time with his twin teenage daughter and son, his adult children from previous marriages and their children. He also returned to India to visit family annually. It seems that every field this man, who had been predestined to be a farmer, touched proved fertile. In addition to seeking balance through cultivating a prolific edible garden in his sprawling backyard, Dr. Singh cultivated scores of lifelong friendships. This Ph.D. integrated his academic understanding of aesthetics with a practical pursuit in his life through his travels, entertaining engaging conversations and turning friends into family. He was a voracious reader, and relatives recall his ability to recite in an instant a bit of ancient wisdom or lines from a poem to fit any situation. He has passed that appreciation for family and his affection for and focus on education across generations of relatives. Dr. Singh is survived by his wife of two decades, Angie, two sons, five daughters, thirteen grandchildren, one great-grandchild and three brothers. He also leaves behind a long list of extended family and friends. His proud legacy lives on with them all. A public memorial service is being planned for mid April. Charitable donations in the name of Dr. Sadanand Singh are appreciated. For additional information, contact dr.singh.memorial@gmail.com"

She was 71. Mrs. Stadler graduated from Antioch College and received a Master's degree from Southern Connecticut State College. She taught in the New Rochelle school system for 45 years until her retirement in 2009. For most of that period, she taught or was based at Columbus School, focusing on special education in her early career and then on mathematics, teaching and coordinating at a district-wide level. Mrs. Stadler was deeply committed to the belief that all children can learn. Her approach reflected the belief that children make meaning through inquiry-based teaching and learning. She taught that through hands-on applications, critical thinking, and problem-based learning, children can be involved and understand at deeper levels. Towards that end she created a great many math games and puzzles. Her underlying faith nurtured the innate intelligence and curiosity of the children. Her favorite direction on math tests was ""show your work"". Mrs Stadler was an accomplished amateur watercolorist and a truly marvelous cook. The daughter of Elliott Maurice Kahn and Marjorie Untermeyer Kahn Sands, Mrs. Stadler was born on July 18, 1938, in New York City. Mrs. Stadler's survivors include her husband of 47 years, Dr. John B. Stadler; sister Julie Shubik (Martin) of New Haven; sons Daniel (Cynthia) of Norwich, Vermont, Alex (Andrew Baker) of Philadelphia, and David (Laura) of New York City; step-daughters Jenny Stadler Carlson (Steve) of Houston and Iyana Stadler (Ruth Fremont) of Philadelphia; stepson Eliot Stadler (Jody) of Minneapolis; grandchildren Henry and Lily Stadler, step-grandchildren Erin, Rita, Russell, and Zoe Carlson and Hannah and Jacob Stadler; niece Claire Shubik, a large extended family and many friends from her home, career and travels. A memorial service for Mrs. Stadler will be held at 4pm on March 27th at the Coveleigh Club (215 Stuyvesant Ave. Rye, NY 10580). In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to the Charlotte Stadler Fund at Columbus Elementary School (275 Washington Ave. New Rochelle, NY 10801)."

A schnitzel's throw from Schiller's, her new cafe on Rivington Street is the perfect respite from early spring crowds.Since the heart of Kinski's Czech-Austrian menu is the humble dumpling, or knödel,served up savory or sweet, it's a pleasant surprise to see that it's not about the same protagonist gussied up in various disguises. The sweet-cheese knödel, for instance, is made of soft farmer's cheese (not unlike ricotta) that has been steamed and rolled in spiced bread crumbs.

She was 71. Mrs. Stadler graduated from Antioch College and received a Master's degree from Southern Connecticut State College. She taught in the New Rochelle school system for 45 years until her retirement in 2009. For most of that period, she taught or was based at Columbus School, focusing on special education in her early career and then on mathematics, teaching and coordinating at a district-wide level. Mrs. Stadler was deeply committed to the belief that all children can learn. Her approach reflected the belief that children make meaning through inquiry-based teaching and learning. She taught that through hands-on applications, critical thinking, and problem-based learning, children can be involved and understand at deeper levels. Towards that end she created a great many math games and puzzles. Her underlying faith nurtured the innate intelligence and curiosity of the children. Her favorite direction on math tests was ""show your work"". Mrs Stadler was an accomplished amateur watercolorist and a truly marvelous cook. The daughter of Elliott Maurice Kahn and Marjorie Untermeyer Kahn Sands, Mrs. Stadler was born on July 18, 1938, in New York City. Mrs. Stadler's survivors include her husband of 47 years, Dr. John B. Stadler; sister Julie Shubik (Martin) of New Haven; sons Daniel (Cynthia) of Norwich, Vermont, Alex (Andrew Baker) of Philadelphia, and David (Laura) of New York City; step-daughters Jenny Stadler Carlson (Steve) of Houston and Iyana Stadler (Ruth Fremont) of Philadelphia; stepson Eliot Stadler (Jody) of Minneapolis; grandchildren Henry and Lily Stadler, step-grandchildren Erin, Rita, Russell, and Zoe Carlson and Hannah and Jacob Stadler; niece Claire Shubik, a large extended family and many friends from her home, career and travels.

2010-03-10T00:00:00Z,"SINGH--Dr. Sadanand, 76, died February 27, 2010, in La Jolla, California. A noted scholar, academic, educator author, entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr. Sadanand Singh led an amazingly fruitful life that helped to shape and influence countless numbers of people across the United States and around the world. Dr. Singh was born in 1934 in a small agricultural village without electricity or running water in the state of Bihar in northern India. Though predestined to become a farmer, Dr. Singh followed a different path shaped by his love of the written word and the desire to educate. He left his remote home to become the first member of his family to earn a college degree. He went on to receive his Master's of Literature from India's Bihar University, in 1958, followed by a Ph.D. in Aesthetics from India's Ranchi University, in 1963. His developing reputation as a scholar reached far beyond Indian borders, leading to an invitation from Ohio State University to join its faculty. He moved to America to accept the position, and in 1965 earned his second doctorate, in Speech and Hearing Science. He joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, DC, in 1967 as a professor and department head, but he returned to Ohio to become Professor of Hearing and Speech Sciences at Ohio University, from 1969 to 1971. This was followed by a position of Professor and Director of the Speech and Hearing Laboratory at the University of Texas in Houston and remained there until 1980, when he became professor and chairman of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at San Diego State University. Among his most treasured roles was that of author. His scholarly work has helped shape the field of speech and hearing, with numerous works including a notable treatise on phonetics, now in its third edition. His success as an author and editor led him into his next career -- that of publisher. In 1980, he and his wife, Kala, an audiologist herself, founded College Hill Press. College Hill became one of the most influential publishing companies in the speech and hearing sciences, with more than 250 titles in print. It was subsequently acquired in 1986 by Time Inc. through its subsidiary Little, Brown & Company of Boston. Tragedy struck the Singhs in 1986. While returning from a family visit to India, Kala Singh was killed during the attempted hijacking of Pan Am flight 73. Dr. Singh and their two young children were seriously injured. While recuperating from the traumatic and harrowing experience, Dr. Singh wrote two manuscripts that remain unpublished. Several years later, he rebounded and married Angie in 1990. Together, they created Singular Publishing Group. Eight years later, Singular had more than 350 titles and seven journals in print. Dr. Singh attempted retirement in 1999, when Singular was acquired by Thomson Delmar (now Delmar Cengage). However, instead of resting on his already notable laurels, he founded ContentScan. The Internet-based literature search program was later acquired by Cambridge Information Group. In 2004, he and his wife, Angie, founded Plural Publishing, which today has a vibrant and growing list of titles in speech, language, voice disorders, swallowing disorders, singing, otolaryngology and audiology. During his many careers, Dr. Singh received a wealth of professional awards and recognitions. A partial list includes three honorary degrees, honorary Phi Beta Kappa membership, the Wilber Gould Highest Honors award from the American Voice Foundation and the Distinguished Services Award from the Council of Graduate Programs in Communication Services and Disorders. In 2004, San Diego State University honored him with the endowed Sadanand Singh Professorship in Communication Sciences and Disorders. And in 2006, he received the Honors of the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association -- the professional association's rarely bestowed highest award -- as well as the Lybarger Award, the highest honor of the American Academy of Audiology. Dr. Sadanand Singh had not only a brilliant mind; he also had a huge heart. Family was at the forefront of his priorities. Despite the distance of miles, he and his brothers spoke daily. He spent much of his time with his twin teenage daughter and son, his adult children from previous marriages and their children. He also returned to India to visit family annually. It seems that every field this man, who had been predestined to be a farmer, touched proved fertile. In addition to seeking balance through cultivating a prolific edible garden in his sprawling backyard, Dr. Singh cultivated scores of lifelong friendships. This Ph.D. integrated his academic understanding of aesthetics with a practical pursuit in his life through his travels, entertaining engaging conversations and turning friends into family. He was a voracious reader, and relatives recall his ability to recite in an instant a bit of ancient wisdom or lines from a poem to fit any situation. He has passed that appreciation for family and his affection for and focus on education across generations of relatives. Dr. Singh is survived by his wife of two decades, Angie, two sons, five daughters, thirteen grandchildren, one great-grandchild and three brothers. He also leaves behind a long list of extended family and friends. His proud legacy lives on with them all. A public memorial service is being planned for mid April. Charitable donations in the name of Dr. Sadanand Singh are appreciated. For additional information, contact dr.singh.memorial@gmail.com"

2010-03-11T00:00:00Z,"IN bad weather, some athletes turn to indoor bike trainers, which hold the bike in place while they pedal. The bicycle is placed upright in the trainer and attached by the rear wheel, and resistance is provided either by magnets or by chambers filled with fluid. The experience isn't the same as road riding, where wind and uneven terrain are factors. But coaches and athletes say that trainers are a decent -- though sometimes noisy -- substitute. ''You don't ever take a break while on a trainer,'' said Mike Ricci, the head coach of the University of Colorado triathlon team in Boulder. ''There are no stop signs, turns or traffic, so you are constantly pedaling.'' Caroline Gaynor, 26, an amateur triathlete, tested trainers for at least 90 minutes each in her apartment in Queens. ''All of them gave me hard workouts,'' she said, ''but 'good' versus 'comfortable' is a big difference when you're spending more than an hour on it.'' YISHANE LEE"

Noting that Ryan has said kind words about Ayn Rand, he writes that ""the core of the Randian worldview, as absorbed by the modern GOP, is a belief that the natural market distribution of income is inherently moral, and the central struggle of politics is to free the successful from having the fruits of their superiority redistributed by looters and moochers."" And he argues: ""Every major element of Ryan's plan reflects this commitment ...  Ryan would retain some bare-bones subsidies for the poorest, but the overwhelming thrust in every way is to liberate the lucky and successful to enjoy their good fortune without burdening them with any responsibility for the welfare of their fellow citizens."""

I had scoffed at its mention in the guidebook, but now I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open, at the naked figures fleeing towards the pit of Hell. These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past; they were my own generation. Because they were naked, they were not imprisoned in their own age by time-bound fashions. On the contrary, their hair and the set of their faces were entirely in the style of my own time. They were me, and people I knew. I had a sudden strong sense of religion being a thing of the present day, not imprisoned under thick layers of time. My large catalogue of misdeeds replayed themselves rapidly in my head. I had absolutely no doubt that I was among the damned, if there were any damned. Van der Weyden was still earning his fee, nearly 500 years after his death."""

Biomorphic lamps, off-the-wall rooms, rodent bow ties, lo-fi rock-band T-shirts, untailored tailoring and John Lennon's nonconformist cool all get their moment in the fashion sun. Elsewhere, we enter the artist Daniel Arsham's imaginarium, where sleight of hand is the house specialty; Jonathan Wingfield interviews the musician Matthew Herbert, who can make you dance to the sound of slaughtered chickens; and Armand Limnander meets Pierre-Alexis Dumas, Hermès's artistic director, who is making the venerable French house more relevant than ever. To cap it off, we profile two actors burning up the screen: our cover star Josh Brolin and the French actor and recently announced Chanel poster boy Gaspard Ulliel, who channels the season's Nouvelle Vague look in a shoot by Paolo Roversi. No wonder we're hot to trot."
2010-03-12T14:56:00Z,"""Securing the Peace in Liberia"" (06:07)It is near midnight and a United Nations peacekeeping force is on patrol in the streets of Monrovia. Armed with Kalashnikov rifles, they are a thin line of security in a place that has been ravaged by years of civil war. Though the image of U.N. forces is not uncommon in parts of Africa, something remarkable is going on Liberia: the armed, uniformed peacekeepers are women. In this fascinating story, Shayla Harris examines the effect that women peacekeepers are having on Liberian society, and ponders how Liberia will cope once they're gone. She speaks with peacekeepers, U.N. officials, women on the street and President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who makes the case that woman are in some ways better suited than men for leadership. Mrs. Sirleaf has put numerous women in high government positions, and the country is creating opportunities for women in the notoriously corrupt police force. Will they succeed? That's the question left unanswered here. The challenge is daunting, but the story inspires hope for a country where hope has for a long time been in short supply. (E.O.)"

The situation underscores the paradox of charter-school oversight: The same freedoms that allow these schools to serve as laboratories of new educational practices also give them unusual financial and managerial latitude. The Alameda County school superintendent praised the school - its formal name is Families of Alameda for Multi-Cultural/Multi-Lingual Education - for providing a needed service for students. Nonetheless, the superintendent, Sheila Jordan, said in interviews that FAME's executive director, Maram Alaiwat, might have engaged in inappropriate activities involving school finances. In addition, three of four members of the school's board last year, including Ms. Alaiwat, had relatives who either worked there or did business with the school. Experts disagreed on whether, and when, the public school systems that authorize charters could intervene."

2010-03-13T00:00:00Z,"The Japanese Coast Guard on Friday arrested an anti-whaling activist from New Zealand who had boarded a whaling ship in the southern Antarctic last month. Peter Bethune, 44, a member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, was brought back to Tokyo by the whaling ship, the Shonan Maru 2, after he boarded it without permission on Feb. 15. Coast Guard officials were waiting for him at the docks, along with a throng of reporters. Japan kills about 1,000 whales a year -- primarily minke whales -- as part of a government-financed program that Tokyo says is for scientific purposes. Activists call the program a cover for commercial whaling, which was globally banned in 1986."

Because the cost would be more than offset by revenues from proposed new taxes and reductions in government spending, the budget office predicted that the bill over all would reduce future federal deficits by $118 billion over 10 years.

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"IN the early 1900s, fashion magazines were rather dull. Clothes were either illustrated or modeled by women who looked like paper dolls. It took the luminous work of Baron Adolph de Meyer, a German aristocrat by way of London, to loosen things up. As the first staff photographer for Vogue and Vanity Fair, he injected high society into fashion editorials, capturing the nascent sexuality and theatrical manners of the leisure class. Typical of his photography is the 1918 shot, above, of the actress Betty Lee, posing in a jet black frock. It is among 100 of his photos now on view at Robert Miller Gallery. Like all things fashionable at the time, Mr. de Meyer's work fell out of favor when modernism came in. But his name remains legendary for having informed the styles of Man Ray and Cecil Beaton, and for having helped vanguard publications like Vogue become portraits of an age.

Aceves went on to retire 12 of his final 14 hitters. Practically every day this spring, Manager Joe Girardi has said he will keep the 12 best pitchers, and at this stage it is difficult to imagine Aceves not being among them.

It's also a parable about immigration. In this case the new arrivals that Mark, an idealistic social worker at the Department of Integration, helps adapt to American life are a broad array of vampires, wizards, yetis, lizard women, land whales, talking octopuses, disembodied brains and other creatures, all with chips on their shoulders -- when they have shoulders. The girlfriend is a horned demon; Mark's slacker roommate is a zombie. (He went zombie for a cute woman in a bar who then decided she liked warlocks.)

(HBO) THE PACIFIC In its second World War II mini-series (the first was ''Band of Brothers,'' in 2001), the team of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg follows three members of the First Marine Division from Guadalcanal through Peleliu, Cape Gloucester, Iwo Jima and Okinawa -- places referred to in this opening episode as ''tiny specks of earth that we have never heard of.'' James Badge Dale, above, Joe Mazzello and Jon Seda play Pfc. Robert Leckie, Pfc. Eugene B . Sledge and Sgt. John Basilone, real-life Marines on whose memoirs and postwar activities this 10-part series is based. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said the battle scenes were ''as vivid, gruesome and haunting as any in 'Band of Brothers' and even 'Saving Private Ryan,' '' the movie that Mr. Spielberg directed and that starred Mr. Hanks. She added: ''For all its realism, 'Band of Brothers' was veined with an almost romantic infatuation with just war and noble warriors. 'The Pacific' is harder to watch and all the better for it.'' 7 P.M. (NBC) MINUTE TO WIN IT The Food Network fixture Guy Fieri (''Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives'') challenges competitors to complete 10 seemingly simple games, each within a minute, for $1 million. The tasks include pulling tissues out of a box one by one until the box is empty, fanning eggs across a floor with a pizza box, and nodding to rack up steps on a pedometer attached to a contestant's head. A father with real estate on his mind and a nanny from Arkansas play first."

So perhaps you were jarred by the news last week that Mattel would bring out new versions based on the TV show about the underside of the Camelot era, ''Mad Men.'' After all, Mad Men like a good party, and, in fact, seem to think of life as a party, with no boundaries for booze, affairs and a good old corporate shiv in the back. Of course, Mattel will take care. It will aim the dolls at adults, and you'll see no cigarettes, martini glasses or cocktail shakers. Still, what will the kids think when they see the dolls in the living room? They're not so innocent anymore."

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"In the dizzying run-up of watch technology of the last 10 or 15 years, the size of watch cases, the number of diamonds on them and the staggering intricacy of their complications were matched only by the astronomical sums the timepieces commanded. It was in the midst of this spinning tourbillon of activity that a few people tried something a lot simpler, a lot cheaper and a lot more colorful. With neon-bright hues, stretchy silicone bands and novel faces, the new '80s-inspired watches could have been worn by bands like the Thompson Twins or the Human League. They all but sing, ''Don't you want me, baby?'' Their timing couldn't be better. The new- wave style of the early '80s (which was itself a mash-up of '50s kitsch and fluorescent color) has influenced not just fashion runways but also indie-pop singers like La Roux and Little Boots. One new brand, RumbaTime, has priced its colorful rubbery bangles at just $20, so even an armful of them won't break the bank."

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"WAINWRIGHT--Stuyvesant II, former U.S. Congressman from the First Congressional District of New York, died at home on March 6th. He was 88 years old. Mr. Wainwright, the son of Carroll L. Wainwright, an artist, and Edith Gould, granddaughter of financier Jay Gould, was a great-nephew of General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, a four star-general who was the hero of Bataan and commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines during World War II. Mr. Wainwright, a life long resident of East Hampton, Long Island, served in Congress for eight years. He authored the bill that created the Fire Island National Park, which was finally passed in 1962 after he had left Congress. He served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Education and Labor Committee and the Merchant Marine Committee. During World War II, Mr. Wainwright enlisted in the army as a private in January of 1942. He was commissioned in 1943 and went overseas with the OSS. He transferred to the regular army and served on the staff of General Courtney Hodges in the First Army G-2 section. After the war he remained an active reservist, finally retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1960. Mr. Wainwright was a member of diplomatic missions to Korea and to Vietnam. Mr. Wainwright went to Westminster School in Simsbury, CT and to Yale University before WW II, and graduated from Yale Law School in 1947. He was a partner in the firm Walker, Beale, Wainwright & Wolf, and later in the firm of Battle, Fowler, Lidstone, Jaffin, Pierce & Kheel. In 1975 he opened an office in Wainscott, New York where he practiced law for many years. Mr. Wainwright served on various corporate boards and was a director and general counsel of the Potter Instrument Company, and the first president of the Miltope Corporation in Melville, LI. He served on the Boards of the Southampton Hospital, Guild Hall of East Hampton, the vestry of St. Luke's Church in East Hampton, the Maidstone Club of East Hampton and the Union Club of New York. He was also a member of Cruising Club of America and Royal Bermuda Yacht Club. He was a consummate sportsman and lover of the outdoors, enjoying hunting, golf, squash, tennis and sailing. An avid sailor, he raced various yachts under the name Wainscott Wind in many blue water races such as the Newport to Bermuda, the Annapolis to Newport, the Marblehead to Halifax, and at least 35 annual Block Island Races. Mr. Wainwright was devoted to his family and its traditions. Thanksgiving was his favorite day. Every year generations of Wainwrights congregated at his house on Georgia Pond to share in his passion for family and country. He is survived by four children, Stuyvesant Wainwright III, Jonathan M. Wainwright, J. Snowden Wainwright and Laura Wainwright; nine grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his brother, Carroll L. Wainwright. A memorial service is planned for later this spring; interment is private. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to St. Anne's Church in Bridgehampton, NY or to East End Hospice, P.O.

There he presented the University in Elista with his compiled work of B. Kotvich's linguistic study of the Kalmyk language, the only existing study at the time. Professor Oulanoff inspired many students during his time of teaching with his love of Russian Literature. His books ""The Serapion Brothers-Theory and Practice"" (1966), and ""The Prose Fiction of Veniamin A. Kaverin"" (1976), became required readings in many University Slavic Departments.

Gucci translated the scuba look into leather vests and jackets, Dsquared showed neoprene life vests, and Italo Zucchelli at Calvin Klein transformed the utilitarian wet suit into modern outerwear. The story of scuba diving began during World War II, when the French navy diver Jacques Cousteau co-invented the first successful aqualung, liberating the diver from connecting hoses; then, in 1952, the physicist Hugh Bradner followed up with the neoprene wet suit.

All this time, we've been operating under the mistaken assumption that you were choosing to get all belligerent every time our college boyfriend called, or to tune us out as your eyes became glued to the waitress's breasts showcased in a T-shirt two sizes too small. It stood to reason, we thought, that you could simply choose otherwise, provided, of course, that you wanted to. Now, however, thanks to Louann Brizendine, M.D., author of ''The Male Brain'' (Broadway Books), we understand that choosing otherwise isn't an option, because evolution has outfitted you with a brain that is, biologically speaking, not the same model as the one we were issued. (Brizendine's ''Female Brain'' was published in 2006, should you ever get the urge to consult it.) The epic bouts of road rage, the narcolepsy after sex, the fanatical fixation on the Big East standings, the hunger for movies full of gunfire and explosions -- finally, we get it. Brizendine fills us in on the male brain's larger areas devoted to muscular action, aggression and sex, formed before birth and modulated throughout life by an exquisitely calibrated blend of testosterone, Müllerian inhibiting substance, androstenedione, vasopressin and other hormones that alter perceptions and lay the groundwork for specific behaviors."

Hence Ermenegildo Zegna's Vellus Aureum award, an annual contest organized by the storied Italian suit-making family to find the highest-quality merino wool on the planet. (Vellus Aureum means ''Golden Fleece'' in Latin; the prize-winning wool grower receives its fleece's equivalent weight in gold.) Now celebrating its 100-year anniversary, Zegna has woven together samples of the competition's top fleeces since 2002 to create one of the lightest fabrics ever worn: the lot's fibers measure 11.1 microns on average, while a human hair averages a whopping 100 microns. Obviously limited by supply (only about 200 feet of cloth is produced) to an edition of 20 and retailing at $22,500, each made-to-order Centennial Vellus Aureum suit takes 18-plus hours to create and passes through more than 330 pairs of hands. ''Is this the ultimate in men's-wear luxury?'' Anna Zegna, the image director of the brand, asks rhetorically. ''Oh, we certainly think so.'' GLENN WALDRON"

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"WE left Manhattan for Brooklyn in 1997. Even then, before it was the rage, it felt like a destination. We kept track of all the things the neighborhoods of Brooklyn had over the metropolis of Manhattan: actual diversity, affordable restaurants, more parking and less pretension. But the best thing, no doubt, every time, was the sky. Brooklyn had sky. Not a sliver of something gauzy above narrow, vertical avenues, but a big sky, clear and vivid, like they brag about in Montana (or maybe New Jersey). The kind of sky with horizons and sunsets and stars. A movie-screen ceiling under which anything could happen. We bounced around brownstone Brooklyn for a dozen years, and the sky moved with us, wide and accessible above tree lines and rooftops. We managed to stay a step ahead of the wrecking ball of development, the rising prices and rising roofs. Eventually, though, nearly all of the area became a teeming construction site.

A solid white cube gives the impression that it's been eaten away. An Arcadian landscape populated only by a kangaroo is invaded by a rectangular slab that hovers in midair. A gouache rendering of Le Corbusier's modernist monastery La Tourette is pictured inside a cave. Arsham's work blurs the lines between art, architecture and performance, and explores issues of natural versus manufactured or intention versus happenstance. It has attracted impressive collaborators -- Merce Cunningham, the choreographer Jonah Bokaer and the fashion designer Hedi Slimane -- as well as the art dealer Emmanuel Perrotin. Arsham's third solo exhibition at Perrotin's Paris gallery, ''Animal Architecture,'' opens on March 20. And to think, he's only 29. Arsham works out of a studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The front room is a nitty-gritty workshop, but in the back there's a serene space with desks for Arsham and Alex Mustonen, an architect. The two founded Snarkitecture, their ''collaborative practice,'' in 2007 to do architectural projects like the commission they recently won for a commemorative marker at the new Florida Marlins ballpark in Miami. The studio's electrical outlets and wires have been relocated to be out of reach of Arsham's pet rabbit, Oliver."

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"I grew up in a tiny village of 200 inhabitants in Spain, but I've always been interested in how different kinds of clothing can open doors or create problems for people. I find it fascinating that when I visit Egypt and wear this galabia, which was handmade for me by a tailor there, I become more integrated into society, while in the West it attracts a lot of unwanted attention. It's also intriguing that in the Middle East, where there is so much discrimination, men essentially walk around in dresses, which is still something that's considered inherently gay in other parts of the world. I used to wear this on the plane when I traveled to New York, but now that's become almost forbidden. I still put it on when I'm in town, though; I love how it feels, and not having to think about what to wear. Plus, I make friends with all the Middle Eastern taxi drivers -- they always have a good reaction when they see me."

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"Midway through ''Imagine: John Lennon,'' the 1988 documentary, Lennon and his new bride, Yoko Ono, are seen prancing through a London airport clad in matching white pantsuits. As ''The Ballad of John and Yoko'' plays in the background -- the tune in which Lennon bemoans that he and Ono are criticized for looking like ''two gurus in drag'' -- viewers get a glimpse of a media-savvy peacock. The world's constant gaze was clearly wearying for Lennon, but that was O.K. because he didn't always take himself seriously. He knew how to have a good time and how to work a look. ''He embodied the idea that the personal is political and demonstrated a fearless commitment to his ever-changing vision,'' says the music journalist Alan Light. ''He was willing to look silly, to reveal himself, to be guided by passion. He wore glasses.''"

But in the meantime, they've been teaching Joris Laarman -- the science-obsessed Dutch designer whose computer-generated Bone Chair caused a frenzy among collectors in 2007 -- how to put their experiments to good use. Laarman's new biomorphic furniture, on view now at the New York gallery Friedman Benda, includes a lamp coated in genetically modified hamster cells that have been engineered to light up like those inside a firefly (below). Housed in a glass dome ''fed'' liquid nutrients and an enzyme, the lamp glows without electricity. ''If products can be grown in a lab, we won't have to use natural resources,'' Laarman says. ''It's the most perfect production method there is.'' Granted, the lamp's cells run according to their own biorhythm, ''charging'' during the day and emitting light at night -- so there's no on and off switch.

BEHIND THE NEWS The trend back toward fur, an expensive material long shunned because of protests by animal-rights activists, seemed surprising in a recession. But fur breeders and furriers have been courting designers aggressively with samples, junkets and technical help for a decade, especially those too young to remember the peak of anti-fur activism in the 1980s and '90s."

2010-03-14T00:00:00Z,"In the introduction to ''Ripped: T-Shirts From the Underground'' (Universe, $30),the no-wave diva Lydia Lunch traces the history of the T-shirt from its silver screen progenitors (Marlon Brando and James Dean) to a London clothing shop called Sex. It was there, circa 1975, that the promoter Malcolm McLaren and the fashion visionary Vivienne Westwood transformed ''four juvenile delinquents who had been caught on numerous occasions pilfering overpriced T-shirts'' into the Sex Pistols.Thirty-five years on, the D.I.Y. iconography of underground music endures, so much so that the 200 vintage tees in ''Ripped'' -- from acts like Gary Numan, Dead Kennedys, Talking Heads and Plasmatics -- look oddly familiar, no doubt thanks to what the book calls ''the onset of ironic consumerism.'' In addition to the tees, which come from the New York vintage impresario CesarPadilla's treasure trove, the book collects memories from post-punk figures like Kid Congo Powers, whose Nick Cave andthe Bad Seeds T-shirt reminds him of a 1986 stint with the band in Berlin: ''Youcan see the yellow junkie sweat stainsin the armpits.''

He faced the brutal industrial changes in his era, when artists felt threatened by photography and machines were taking over from humans. Yet a fantastic, high-speed world was also opening up."

He strayed from acting last year, to appear in a Longchamp campaign with Kate Moss, but don't expect to see him on the runways anytime soon. ''I'm not really a model,'' he says. ''When I'm doing a photo shoot, I'm not playing a part. I'm just trying to be myself.'' The actor found Paolo Roversi's way of shooting this story, using digital video and then selecting still images, a stimulating challenge. ''When you're posing, usually you change your attitude when you hear the shutter click,'' he says. ''Here I never really knew when the picture was taken. It was odd but fun.'' Though he professes fashion ignorance, Ulliel's mother is a stylist, and his father is a former fashion designer. ''I credit my parents with my sensitivity to art and creativity,'' he explains. A more recent influence on his style is the custom-built Mecatwin motorcycle he bought two years ago. Since then, everything he wears must pass the bike test: ''Your clothes must match your lifestyle.'' Enough said. Alexandra Marshall"

But I loved the quiet, the bluish-blackness out the window, less menacing than midnight dark.

""Pragmatic"" is also related (at least etymologically) to pragmatism, the name of a distinctively American philosophy that emerged in the early decades of the 20th century in the work of William James, John Dewey and C.S. Peirce. Pragmatism may or may not be an ethical program depending on whose version you are reading, but it always emphasizes the resources of historically given institutions and practices and de-emphasizes the role played in our lives by supra-historical essentialisms (God, faith, truth, reason, brute fact, overarching theory) even to the extent sometimes of denying their existence."

2010-03-15T13:09:09Z,"Since my column today uses the release of Paul Greengrass's ""Green Zone"" as an occasion to complain about how Hollywood can't seem to capture the complexities and ironies of real-world politics, it seems worthwhile to mention a few recent exceptions to this rule. This will be a short list: Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" is on it, so is Alexander Payne's ""Election"" (yes, it takes place in a high school - what's your point?), and so is the portrait of Baltimore's mayoral politics on David Simon's ""The Wire."" (The character of Clarence Royce, the compromised incumbent, is a particularly good example of how a storyteller can be fair to a fundamentally unsympathetic figure.) David O. Russell's great ""Three Kings"" doesn't feature any politicians, but it captures the tragic ironies of our involvement in Iraq with more clarity and sensitivity than any of the movies made about the second Gulf War. Neither Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" nor Mike Nichols' ""Primary Colors"" are particularly successful movies, but both make a good-faith effort to portray polarizing figures from our recent past in shades of gray, rather than just black and white. (About the rest of Stone's forays into political subjects, the less said the better.) And one of the reasons so many people praised - and overpraised - the political themes in ""The Dark Knight,"" I suspect, is that even an attempt at political ambiguity (and in a superhero movie, no less) seemed impressive, given how rarely Hollywood goes in for anything save caricature."

In fact, the last time they were a top seed was in 2006, when they lost in the Round of 16. This team has all the makings of an upset victim. Duke (29-5) fattened its record on a down Atlantic Coast Conference, and its biggest victory was arguably against No. 8 seed Gonzaga. All of the Blue Devils' defeats came on the road, including losses to No. 3 seed Georgetown, No. 4 seed Wisconsin, No. 4 seed Maryland and No. 10 seed Georgia Tech. Furthermore, they do not have much beyond their big three of Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler and Nolan Smith. After a stretch of seven Final Four appearances in nine years from 1986 to 1994, it is hard to believe that the Blue Devils have not made it that far since 2004.

2010-03-16T17:15:25Z,"""I think that liberals view the market as a somewhat barbaric and unfair mechanism for allocating resources. They view government as a mechanism for restoring fairness and justice. To a libertarian, the market mechanism is civilized. When people buy and sell in the market, they are making voluntary, mutually beneficial exchanges. In contrast, government is an arena where one side wins and the other side loses. When I shop for a coat, if I do not like the way a coat fits or how it looks, or how much the seller wants me to pay, I do not buy that coat. I buy a different coat, perhaps in a different store. The shopping process leads to peaceful, mutually satisfying trade. On the other hand, look at how the issue of health care reform is going to be resolved. It is like gang warfare, where the Democrats and Republicans are going to rumble, and at least one side is going to be very unhappy with the outcome. For me, it is the democratic process that is barbaric, and it is the market process that is comparatively peaceful and civilized."""

''I still have my options open,'' Justice Stevens, who will turn 90 in April, said in a March 8 interview with The New Yorker. Justice Stevens, the court's longest-serving justice and the leader of its liberal wing, has hired only one law clerk for the term that starts in October. That is the number allotted to retired justices; active ones get four. But he cautioned against reading too much into that hint. ''When I decided to just hire one clerk,'' he said, ''three of my four clerks last year said they'd work for me next year if I wanted them to.'' He was willing to make one categorical statement: ''You can say I will retire within the next three years. I'm sure of that.''"

Onstage, it's a seven-man band, and even though they're striving to replicate the arrangements on the album, down to the oozy keyboard effects, its flesh-and-blood players and bigger crescendos help the songs escape the subdued studio production. The songs are still morose about many human failings, but not so withdrawn, a shading that makes a difference--more psychedelic, less studied.

I think it's a good thing that the countermajoritarian customs of the Senate, as adapted by the minority for a more ideological age, have made it very difficult to pass a sweeping overhaul of America's de facto constitution. But I also think it's appropriate that there exists, for an extremely determined but not-quite-super majority, mechanisms that allow legislators to overcome these hurdles and push a controversial piece of legislation through. ""Hard but not absolutely impossible"" seems like the right bar to set for a bill of this nature. I wish the Democrats had chosen a different path, but in the end, we live in a republic, not a direct democracy: If our elected representatives can really muster enough votes, within the rules, to pass health care legislation even after everything that's happened - if they believe that strongly, in other words, that this is absolutely and without question the right policy for America - then they have every right to go for it. It may be their funeral, but it's certainly their prerogative."

2010-03-17T09:46:26Z,"The unlovely term ""vernacular architecture"" describes some of the most unusual buildings ever created by man, from Mongolian yurts and adobe pueblos to igloos, Irish sod houses, and Iranian desert towns. Many of these structures (like a tree-house that soars 140 feet above the West Papuan rain forest) lie at the frontiers of the imagination, while others (like a shanty in Manila held together with urban waste) we'd prefer to forget. The forthcoming book ""Buildings Without Architects"" (Rizzoli; $23) presents them all as works of grassroots ingenuity. Written by John May, who authored the official history of Greenpeace, the book pegs modish keywords like ""energy-efficient"" and ""sustainable"" to ancient buildings, most of which were made of stuff that's been around since prehistoric times: wood, reed, earth and clay. A house built with used Heineken bottles is a curious exception."

2010-03-17T08:48:09Z,"As I've written many times in various contexts since the crisis began, being in a liquidity trap reverses many of the usual rules of economic policy. Virtue becomes vice: attempts to save more actually make us poorer, in both the short and the long run. Prudence becomes folly: a stern determination to balance budgets and avoid any risk of inflation is the road to disaster. Mercantilism works: countries that subsidize exports and restrict imports actually do gain at their trading partners' expense. For the moment -- or more likely for the next several years -- we're living in a world in which none of what you learned in Econ 101 applies."

He and Mauricio Paniagua, known for trippy creations like their three-foot-tall table in the shape of a grasshopper, conceived the series as homage to Fornasetti while introducing the world to their hometown heroes. The rest of the cast includes the poet Pita Amor, the architect Luis Barragán (left) and - the lookers of the bunch - the actors Andrés García and Verónica Castro. The group originally included Diego Luna and Salma Hayek, Moxham says, ""but we took them out because they're not as legendary."" Available at thefutureperfect.com."

The city is also home to a thriving design scene spawned in large part by the Savannah College of Art and Design. While SCAD, as the 30-year-old college is known, built its reputation as one of the country's leading design schools, its administration wisely snapped up a number of big, beautiful (and, let's not forget, historic) buildings that faced probable demolition. As a result, its schools, lecture halls and administrative buildings are seamlessly woven into Savannah's urban fabric, making the college an integral part of the city and revitalizing several once-derelict neighborhoods."

Jackie was a true girl of the Golden West -- a soft, kind, luscious, full-lipped, blonde, blue-eyed, outdoorsy beauty whose gorgeous face was usually framed in a Stetson hat. Born in Rupert, Idaho. A graduate of Twin Falls High School. First girl from the State of Idaho to attend Vassar College. Bachelor of Arts, 1951, Master of Fine Arts, Yale School of Design, 1953.

Instead she became Jacqueline Beymer, ASID, member American Society of Interior Designers, met her husband decorating his bachelor apartment, and led the grande dames of interior design as President of the Decorators Club, 1978-1980, the oldest women's professional organization in America. She taught art and design at Pace University. Scholar, dreamboat, and organization lady, she designed the Look-It-Up Book, ""always a place for everything and everything in its place.""

2010-03-18T00:00:00Z,"9 P.M. (HBO) AFGHAN STAR (2009) In Afghanistan music is viewed as sinful by Islamic fundamentalists, who have sometimes called for performers' deaths. Yet since 2005 millions of viewers have been tuning into ''Afghan Star,'' a talent show in the style of ''American Idol,'' on Tolo TV, a popular independent channel. In this documentary Havana Marking tells the story of four young finalists -- two men and two women, including Lima Sahar, above -- as they risk their lives to sing. She also witnesses some viewers' first encounters with democracy as they vote for their favorite singers via cellphone while the Taliban threaten to destroy the country's mobile-phone network. (The 2008 season finale drew 11 million viewers, about a third of Afghanistan's population.) Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film engrossing, adding that it ''subverts the cliché image of Afghanistan as a nation of intractably primitive, superstitious tribespeople who have little in common with Westerners.''

""Delta was one of the more conservative airlines,"" Force says. ""We didn't have hot pants."" Still, for almost 40 straight years, the airline's female flight attendants (something called ""stewardesses"") turned heads. In the 1940s, they did it with military-style overseas caps and spectator shoes; in the '50s, with futurist insignias and stiletto pumps; and in the '60s, with A-line topcoats, alligator-print boots, Chanel-inspired jackets with three-quarter-length sleeves and the ""Delberet,"" a pillbox hat designed for Delta by Mea Hanauer, a New York milliner. The '70s were all about coo-coo colors, bell-bottom pants, Slavic tunics and, weirdly, a yellow raincoat. And then in the '80s, Delta took a sartorial nosedive that it couldn't recover from until 2001. Return your seat to its upright position, and take a look."

""The future of surfing is apparently in the air,"" said Kelly Slater, a world champion. Competition is becoming more open to radical maneuvers. New rules are rewarding difficulty over consistency. As this video by Erik Olsen and Matt Higgins reveals, the stage was set in the late 1980s. Pioneer aerialists like Christian Fletcher employed the new moves but paid a high personal price. They were barred from competition and lost sponsorships. Mr. Olsen said he recognized that viewers have become accustomed to a high level of sophistication in surfing videos, adding that he was thankful to have found sources like Jon Steele and Elliot Leboe, ""two fantastic filmmakers"" who provided extra footage. The result is a dazzling exploration of surfing's past, present and probably airborne future. (K.B.)"
2010-03-19T14:37:27Z,"""When conservative critics of our universities nowadays lament the decline of liberal education, they usually decry its replacement by a left-leaning politicized agenda. But the deeper truth is that liberal education has been more fundamentally displaced by scientific education buttressed by the demands of global competition. While conservatives might wish to apportion blame to those increasingly irrelevant faculty whose postmodernism has become a form of stale institutional orthodoxy, the truth is that the rise of this sort of faculty was a response to conditions that were already making liberal education irrelevant, a self-destructive effort to make the humanities 'up to date.' These purported radicals - mostly bourgeois former children of the 1960s - were not agents of liberation, but rather symptoms of the neglect of the liberal arts in a dawning new age of science reinforced by global competition."
