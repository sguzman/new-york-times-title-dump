Devoted wife of Walter, with whom she shared a rewarding 62 year marriage, loving mother of Robert (Diane) and Richard (Susan), nurturing grandmother of Andrew, Danny, Kevin and Thomas, loyal sister of the late Suzanne Heimerdinger, faithful sister-in-law of Edith Gelles (Michael Weiss), David (Pam) Gelles, Carol Gold Gelles (Henry Gelles, deceased), and John (Marilyn) Heimerdinger, and caring aunt of 12 nieces and nephews. During her lifetime, Carol touched many other lives with her warmth, generosity and love. In her role as homemaker, she was a wonderful wife and mom, and her passing is a tremendous loss to her husband and children. She was an excellent friend who valued the people in her life. She was an optimistic and creative person who always enjoyed learning and trying new things. She loved playing the music of Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Frederic Chopin and Claude Debussy on her piano, reading the autobiographies of such people as Alec Guinness, Sonia Sotomayor and Marcia Davenport, and writing letters (and in more recent years, emails) to family and friends. We will all miss Carol very much. A funeral service is scheduled for Sunday, October 6 at 3pm at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 West Broad Street, Mount Vernon. In lieu of flowers, a donation in Carol's memory can be made online to Temple Israel of New Rochelle, Temple Israel Cares Fund, by going to their website at http://tinr.org and following instructions."

2013-09-28T00:00:00Z,"STIFEL--Henry George Jr.,85, of Vero Beach, FL and Jackson Hole, WY and formerly of Short Hills, NJ, died on September 18, 2013. ""Hank,"" as his many friends and colleagues called him, lived a full life as a distinguished business executive, civic leader, philanthropist, Air Force veteran, and family man. Motivated by an automobile accident that left his seventeen-year-old son Henry G. Stifel III in a wheelchair in 1982, Hank dedicated much of his life thereafter leading efforts to find a cure for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury. Conventional wisdom at the time was that spinal cord injuries were permanent, and as a consequence there were very few researchers (or research dollars) in the field. Hank and his wife Charlotte refused to accept this supposition. With the help of friends and others who were touched by spinal cord injury, Hank founded and was President, CEO, and Chairman of the Stifel Paralysis Research Foundation (SPRF) whose mission was to raise funds and encourage research for a cure for paralysis and related neurological disorders. Several years later, Hank became Chairman and CEO of the American Paralysis Association (APA), into which he merged SPRF. In 1995 Christopher Reeve, the actor best known for his role as Superman, was paralyzed in a horse riding accident. Reeve reached out to Hank, and Chris and his wife Dana soon committed themselves to ""the cure,"" subsequently joining the board of the APA. Shortly thereafter the APA was renamed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, Chris Reeve became Chairman, and Hank became Chairman Emeritus. With the Reeve Foundation as a leading fund raising organization, great strides in research have created therapies and treatments that have helped thousands of spinal cord injured victims regain function and dramatically improve their quality of life. There is now significant optimism that a cure is on the horizon. Hank was a successful business leader. In 1959 Hank became Vice President & General Manager of Xerox of Canada Ltd. where, under his eight years of leadership, Xerox grew dramatically. Hank subsequently joined Armotek Industries, Inc., Palmyra, NJ, in 1964, from which he retired in 1988 as CEO and Chairman. Under Hank's leadership, Armotek became a leading engraver for the gravure and flexographic printing industries. Hank also served on the boards of Titanium Industries, Inc. and Banker Securities Life Insurance Company. Hank Stifel was also a Founding Partner of the New York Islanders, an NHL hockey organization. Hank generously supported education, the arts and the environment. He served on the boards of The Pingry School, Martinsville, NJ and the Choate Rosemary Hall School, Wallingford, CT. In honor of their son, Hank and Charlotte established the Henry G. Stifel III Scholarship at Choate Rosemary Hall and The Pingry School, which is awarded to individuals who have overcome adversity and exhibited qualities of courage, endurance and optimism. Hank served on the boards of the Vero Beach Museum of Art, Vero Beach, FL and The National Museum of Wildlife Art, Jackson, WY. He also served on the board of the Indian River Land Trust, Vero Beach, FL. Hank was an avid golfer, skier, sportsman and traveler. Whether he was heli-skiing in Canada (at age 72), looking down from a hot air-balloon at the migration of the wildebeests in Kenya, pedaling a bike from vineyard to vineyard through Burgundy, hiking in the mountains of Nepal, or trekking through the deserts of Morocco on a camel, Hank was always on the go. His club memberships include the Princeton Club of New York, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, NJ, the Short Hills Club, Short Hills, NJ, the Johns Island Club, Red Stick Golf Club, and Windsor Club, Vero Beach, FL, Ekwonok Country Club, Manchester, VT, and Teton Pines Country Club, Jackson, WY. He was a co-founder of the Bombay Bicycle and Ski Club. Hank attended the Choate School, Wallingford, CT. and was captain of its varsity basketball team. He graduated from Princeton University (Class of 1949) with a degree in Psychology. While at Princeton, he played varsity basketball, was advertising manager of the Nassau Sovereign, and was a member of the Elm Club. From 1951 to 1953 Hank enlisted in the Air Force and served as Lieutenant, Wheelus Air Base, Tripoli, Libya. Henry George Stifel, Jr. was born on December 15, 1927 to Henry G. Stifel, Sr., and Elizabeth P. Stevenson in Wheeling, WV. He is predeceased by his sister Elizabeth Stifel Kline. He is survived by his loving family: his wife, Charlotte Snead Stifel; three daughters, Wendy Hansen, Mountainside, NJ, Stephanie Coughlan, Wellesley, MA and Amy Quinn, Denver, CO; his son, Henry G. Stifel III, New York, NY; and nine grandchildren. The celebration of Hank's life will be held at Christ Church, 561 Springfield Ave, Summit, NJ. The service will be Saturday, October 12th at 4pm. Relatives and friends are invited to visit with the family at the church on Friday, October 11th from 2pm to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm. Services are made by William A.

We will remember Hank's wisdom, his wicked sense of humor and contagious smile, and his legacy will serve as inspiration for the Foundation. Our thoughts are with Charlotte and her family and in particular, Henry G. Stifel III, Vice Chairman of the Reeve board."
2013-09-29T00:00:00Z,"STIFEL--Henry George Jr.,85, of Vero Beach, FL and Jackson Hole, WY and formerly of Short Hills, NJ, died on September 18, 2013. ""Hank,"" as his many friends and colleagues called him, lived a full life as a distinguished business executive, civic leader, philanthropist, Air Force veteran, and family man. Motivated by an automobile accident that left his seventeen-year-old son Henry G. Stifel III in a wheelchair in 1982, Hank dedicated much of his life thereafter leading efforts to find a cure for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury. Conventional wisdom at the time was that spinal cord injuries were permanent, and as a consequence there were very few researchers (or research dollars) in the field. Hank and his wife Charlotte refused to accept this supposition. With the help of friends and others who were touched by spinal cord injury, Hank founded and was President, CEO, and Chairman of the Stifel Paralysis Research Foundation (SPRF) whose mission was to raise funds and encourage research for a cure for paralysis and related neurological disorders. Several years later, Hank became Chairman and CEO of the American Paralysis Association (APA), into which he merged SPRF. In 1995 Christopher Reeve, the actor best known for his role as Superman, was paralyzed in a horse riding accident. Reeve reached out to Hank, and Chris and his wife Dana soon committed themselves to ""the cure,"" subsequently joining the board of the APA. Shortly thereafter the APA was renamed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, Chris Reeve became Chairman, and Hank became Chairman Emeritus. With the Reeve Foundation as a leading fund raising organization, great strides in research have created therapies and treatments that have helped thousands of spinal cord injured victims regain function and dramatically improve their quality of life. There is now significant optimism that a cure is on the horizon. Hank was a successful business leader. In 1959 Hank became Vice President & General Manager of Xerox of Canada Ltd. where, under his eight years of leadership, Xerox grew dramatically. Hank subsequently joined Armotek Industries, Inc., Palmyra, NJ, in 1964, from which he retired in 1988 as CEO and Chairman. Under Hank's leadership, Armotek became a leading engraver for the gravure and flexographic printing industries. Hank also served on the boards of Titanium Industries, Inc. and Banker Securities Life Insurance Company. Hank Stifel was also a Founding Partner of the New York Islanders, an NHL hockey organization. Hank generously supported education, the arts and the environment. He served on the boards of The Pingry School, Martinsville, NJ and the Choate Rosemary Hall School, Wallingford, CT. In honor of their son, Hank and Charlotte established the Henry G. Stifel III Scholarship at Choate Rosemary Hall and The Pingry School, which is awarded to individuals who have overcome adversity and exhibited qualities of courage, endurance and optimism. Hank served on the boards of the Vero Beach Museum of Art, Vero Beach, FL and The National Museum of Wildlife Art, Jackson, WY. He also served on the board of the Indian River Land Trust, Vero Beach, FL. Hank was an avid golfer, skier, sportsman and traveler. Whether he was heli-skiing in Canada (at age 72), looking down from a hot air-balloon at the migration of the wildebeests in Kenya, pedaling a bike from vineyard to vineyard through Burgundy, hiking in the mountains of Nepal, or trekking through the deserts of Morocco on a camel, Hank was always on the go. His club memberships include the Princeton Club of New York, Baltusrol Golf Club, Springfield, NJ, the Short Hills Club, Short Hills, NJ, the Johns Island Club, Red Stick Golf Club, and Windsor Club, Vero Beach, FL, Ekwonok Country Club, Manchester, VT, and Teton Pines Country Club, Jackson, WY. He was a co-founder of the Bombay Bicycle and Ski Club. Hank attended the Choate School, Wallingford, CT. and was captain of its varsity basketball team. He graduated from Princeton University (Class of 1949) with a degree in Psychology. While at Princeton, he played varsity basketball, was advertising manager of the Nassau Sovereign, and was a member of the Elm Club. From 1951 to 1953 Hank enlisted in the Air Force and served as Lieutenant, Wheelus Air Base, Tripoli, Libya. Henry George Stifel, Jr. was born on December 15, 1927 to Henry G. Stifel, Sr., and Elizabeth P. Stevenson in Wheeling, WV. He is predeceased by his sister Elizabeth Stifel Kline. He is survived by his loving family: his wife, Charlotte Snead Stifel; three daughters, Wendy Hansen, Mountainside, NJ, Stephanie Coughlan, Wellesley, MA and Amy Quinn, Denver, CO; his son, Henry G. Stifel III, New York, NY; and nine grandchildren. The celebration of Hank's life will be held at Christ Church, 561 Springfield Ave, Summit, NJ. The service will be Saturday, October 12th at 4pm. Relatives and friends are invited to visit with the family at the church on Friday, October 11th from 2pm to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm. Services are made by William A.

2013-09-29T00:00:00Z,"SPEAR--Harold Charles, MD. Harold Charles Spear, MD, was born on September 29, 1923 and died on August 29, 2013. His father, Harold Spear, was the founder of the New York Stock Exchange's specialist firm, Spear, Leeds, and Kellogg and he saw to it that Dr. Spear had a magical childhood. He grew up on a New Jersey farm called The Meadows which was dedicated to growing crops and poultry for the household and also had a stable of polo ponies which often were used in tournaments on the grounds of The Meadows and elsewhere. When Dr. Spear was age two, he went with his grandfather to Paris where he could remember putting his toy sailboat in the Grand Bassin located in the Bois de Boulogne along with other French children. When a little older, he traveled by yacht, again with his grandfather, down the Intracoastal Waterway from New Jersey to Miami, stayed at the Royal Poinciana Hotel in downtown Miami, then they went around the straits of Florida to Florida City. Later Dr. Spear attended Collegiate School in New York City, The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and then went on to Yale where he was in World War II's accelerated pre-medical school classes. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1947, married Suzanne Bowmall McLaury that same year, and had three children, Laurinda Hope Spear, Harold Charles (Tex) Spear, MD, and Alison Leelyn Spear. He interned at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City, then went on for residencies at Yale, Mayo Clinic, and finished them at Yale. Dr. Spear was taken into the United States Air Force as Chief of Surgery at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston, Texas. There he was joined as his Assistant Chief of Surgery by Paul S. Russell, MD, now the John Homans Distinguished Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, then and until Dr. Spear's death, his best friend. While Dr. Spear was in Houston, in 1951 one of the country's most virulent polio epidemic swept through the city and his son, Tex, only six months old, contracted infantile paralysis as it then was called, which has left him handicapped until the present day. The Salk vaccine inoculations for children against polio were not available until 1954. Because of the responsibilities of raising a crippled child, Dr. Spear moved to Miami in 1956 where the warm climate and the availability of year round swimming would be an invaluable asset for his son. In Miami, Dr. Spear joined the city's first thoracic surgical partnership, DeWitt Daughtry, MD and John Chesney, MD, which soon was known as Daughtry, Chesney, Spear. They taught at the University of Miami School of Medicine and did experimental work during the early days of heart lung machines, heart transplants, and pace makers while continuing to have a busy private practice. Dr. Spear was an early proponent of the correlations between good health, exercise, and diet. He was vehemently against smoking long before the tenet became common knowledge. He exercised daily and was one of the first crack of dawn joggers in Miami Shores where he and his family lived, much to the consternation of his neighbors. Dedication was Dr. Spear's lode star. He was dedicated to his family, his patients, and to his profession, the practice of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery. He valued his association with other physicians and countless of them were his friends. Always Dr. Spear was honored when his medical peers came to him for treatment themselves, or sent him their families for surgery. Not only were they from Miami and other parts of Florida, at times they would come to him from other states. In his practice, never did he charge other physicians or their family members any fees. Most people have some sort of prejudices. Dr. Spear was a man with none. He saw the human spirit within each individual, the person sweeping the hospital floors was as important to him as the CEO of a large company. He never seemed rushed with people or his patients and he always was calm and soft spoken in the operating room. The only complaint operating room nurses ever made about him was that during operations, he talked mainly about one thing with his associates and residents, football. Football was his delight. Dr. Spear has written a memoir about the early days of cardiac, thoracic, and vascular surgery at Harvard, Yale, and Mayo Clinic, and at the start of his career during the early days when Miami was a quiet Southern town, which will be published in the near future. Some of his early Miami adventures included practicing in about ten hospitals, occasionally he would mention them to his family and friends just as a matter of fact, always modestly, he had to cover them all. Before the I-95 expressway was built, Dr. Spear faced the challenge of reaching the hospitals often by back roads, at times in the dark, because as a specialist, he was on call for many emergency rooms. He would say, ""Between midnight and 4:00am, that's when there's trouble."" Yet he never complained about getting up around 2:00am after a long day in surgery, getting dressed in a suit, shirt, and tie, then driving alone through the night in response to the call. Truly, Dr. Spear was a man for others. A private celebration of Dr. Spear's life was held on September 7, 2013. He is survived by his wife, Suzanne Bowmall McLaury Spear, daughters, Laurinda Hope Spear, Alison Leelyn Spear, sister, Nancy Rossbach and family, a son, Harold Charles Spear Ill, MD, sons-in-law, Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Alexander Stevens Reese, grandchildren, Marisa Rose Fort, Alexander Charles Paul Fort, Nicholas McLaury Fort, Raymond August Fort, Harold Emil Fort, Gabriel Bernard Fort, Leslie Caylin Spear, Harold Arthur Spear, Charlotte Rosalind Spear, Jeremy Acheson Spear Platt, Carolina Clare Spear Gomez, Isabella Clementine Bliss Reese and great-grandchildren Gil Spear and Emilia Hope Adams."

2013-09-29T00:00:00Z,"COOPER--Margarett Gillespie, died peacefully on September 20, 2013 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was born in Ohio on October 15, 1913, to Ella and Isaac Nathaniel Gillespie and was the youngest among Isaac Jr., Constance and Paul. Margarett took her father's love of books and her own delight in people to Wilberforce College where she was both a stellar student and a homecoming queen. Her mentor, the college librarian, was a force for intellectual and professional ambition, and Margarett graduated in 1937 with a determination to pursue graduate study in library science. When depression era scarcity delayed Margarett's studies, she taught for two years in a WPA nursery school. She subsequently earned a Masters in library science at Hampton University and pursued additional graduate study at Columbia University. She worked as a children's librarian in Virginia, and Ohio, inspiring growth and hope in countless young people. While at Hampton University, Margarett met and fell in love with a dashing young undergraduate, George Clinton Cooper. Their marriage in 1939 lasted until his death in 2002. George was a member of the ""Golden Thirteen,"" the first African American officers in the United States Navy. He subsequently headed the trade school at Hampton, after which the couple moved to Ohio where George continued to work in education and urban administration. After her husband's death, Margarett moved to New York, a city she had always loved. Margarett thrived on New York's intellectual richness and quickly gathered friends across its multiple cultures. A painstaking genealogist, she discovered a family history of slave resistance and proud emancipation. An ardent fan of jazz and classical music, she was, at age 97, a savvy guest host on WBGO Jazz Radio. (To see a photo and listen to the broadcast visit http://www.wbgo.org/ blog/margaret-cooper-host-hour.) Margarett was an enthusiastic supporter and goading advisor to all the people she loved. She is survived by a daughter, Peggy Cooper Davis, a son-in-law, Gordon J. Davis, a granddaughter, Elizabeth Cooper Davis, a great- grandson, Johari Cooper Davis Moses and a large and adoring circle of extended family and friends. Margarett was a generous, sharp-witted, politically passionate and spirited force throughout her 100 years. We celebrate her life even as we suffer her loss. Friends are encouraged to honor her memory with commitment to social justice. She would also be honored by gifts to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Center for Family Representation, Jazz at Lincoln Center or the Studio Museum of Harlem."

Daughter of Italian immigrants, she overcame discrimination against both her gender and ethnicity to rise to a top legal position in New York State. Mrs. Beary graduated cum laude from St. John's University, New York, Law School in 1944, into a profession that accepted women as legal secretaries but not attorneys. In the 1950s, her keen interest in politics led her to the local Democratic club.

After serving as president of the Queens Women's Bar Association, in 1960, she filed suit against the Queens Bar Association, which had denied her membership, ending an 84-year ban against women members. She was the youngest woman of her time admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1964, Mrs. Beary was appointed Assistant New York State Attorney General, heading litigation in its bureau of mental hygiene. She retired from the state in 1988 and moved to Florida with her husband, Patrick Beary.

Born in Brooklyn, NY on June 14, 1913 and schooled in Brooklyn at the Adelphi Academy, she graduated from Smith College in 1933 and earned her Master's in Social Work in 1935 from the Smith College School for Social Work. She worked at the Jewish Board of Guardians (JBG) where, in 1942, she job-shared her work on delinquency and family problems, and also represented the New York Jewish agencies in the court system. After leaving the JBG, she worked for the Child Adoption Committee. Later, she focused on career counseling, psychotherapy, and then geriatric services. She was appointed to boards that looked at the needs of elders throughout Massachusetts, including one at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. She served on the first board of the Franklin County Home Care for 25 years and represented her community during this time. In addition, she was appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts to be one of six national Ombudsman on the Board of Registration of Nursing Home Administrators, a position she held for a number of years. She married Solomon Barkin in 1940, a prominent labor economist, and enjoyed his companionship for almost 60 years. The family lived in Manhattan, Great Neck, NY, and Paris, France, where her husband was in the diplomatic corps assigned to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The family returned to live in Leverett, MA where her husband had a tenured professorship in the Economics Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Survivors include her three children, David, Roger, and Amy and three grandsons, Adam, Michael and Benjamin, two great-grandsons, Jacob and Eli, and a large circle of friends. Elaine was a feisty, dedicated, socially active and colorful woman who remained mentally alert until her death. She had a life-long love of learning and appetite for life. Up until her last days she took courses in the local Five College 'Learning in Retirement' program. She was a lover of opera, music, theatre, bridge, gourmet cooking, reading and travel. She will be remembered as a deeply loving mother, a generous and devoted friend and confidant, a 'bon vivant', an extraordinary listener and advisor to the young (and not so young), a hostess, an eternal optimist, a 'raconteuse extraordinaire', and a role model for graceful aging! She was a kind and selfless person, beloved by all she met. She brightened the lives of those she touched and left footprints on our hearts, and we will never be the same.

2013-09-30T00:00:00Z,"SPEAR--Harold Charles, MD. Harold Charles Spear, MD, was born on September 29, 1923 and died on August 29, 2013. His father, Harold Spear, was the founder of the New York Stock Exchange's specialist firm, Spear, Leeds, and Kellogg and he saw to it that Dr. Spear had a magical childhood. He grew up on a New Jersey farm called The Meadows which was dedicated to growing crops and poultry for the household and also had a stable of polo ponies which often were used in tournaments on the grounds of The Meadows and elsewhere. When Dr. Spear was age two, he went with his grandfather to Paris where he could remember putting his toy sailboat in the Grand Bassin located in the Bois de Boulogne along with other French children. When a little older, he traveled by yacht, again with his grandfather, down the Intracoastal Waterway from New Jersey to Miami, stayed at the Royal Poinciana Hotel in downtown Miami, then they went around the straits of Florida to Florida City. Later Dr. Spear attended Collegiate School in New York City, The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and then went on to Yale where he was in World War II's accelerated pre-medical school classes. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1947, married Suzanne Bowmall McLaury that same year, and had three children, Laurinda Hope Spear, Harold Charles (Tex) Spear, MD, and Alison Leelyn Spear. He interned at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City, then went on for residencies at Yale, Mayo Clinic, and finished them at Yale. Dr. Spear was taken into the United States Air Force as Chief of Surgery at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston, Texas. There he was joined as his Assistant Chief of Surgery by Paul S. Russell, MD, now the John Homans Distinguished Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, then and until Dr. Spear's death, his best friend. While Dr. Spear was in Houston, in 1951 one of the country's most virulent polio epidemic swept through the city and his son, Tex, only six months old, contracted infantile paralysis as it then was called, which has left him handicapped until the present day. The Salk vaccine inoculations for children against polio were not available until 1954. Because of the responsibilities of raising a crippled child, Dr. Spear moved to Miami in 1956 where the warm climate and the availability of year round swimming would be an invaluable asset for his son. In Miami, Dr. Spear joined the city's first thoracic surgical partnership, DeWitt Daughtry, MD and John Chesney, MD, which soon was known as Daughtry, Chesney, Spear. They taught at the University of Miami School of Medicine and did experimental work during the early days of heart lung machines, heart transplants, and pace makers while continuing to have a busy private practice. Dr. Spear was an early proponent of the correlations between good health, exercise, and diet. He was vehemently against smoking long before the tenet became common knowledge. He exercised daily and was one of the first crack of dawn joggers in Miami Shores where he and his family lived, much to the consternation of his neighbors. Dedication was Dr. Spear's lode star. He was dedicated to his family, his patients, and to his profession, the practice of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery. He valued his association with other physicians and countless of them were his friends. Always Dr. Spear was honored when his medical peers came to him for treatment themselves, or sent him their families for surgery. Not only were they from Miami and other parts of Florida, at times they would come to him from other states. In his practice, never did he charge other physicians or their family members any fees. Most people have some sort of prejudices. Dr. Spear was a man with none. He saw the human spirit within each individual, the person sweeping the hospital floors was as important to him as the CEO of a large company. He never seemed rushed with people or his patients and he always was calm and soft spoken in the operating room. The only complaint operating room nurses ever made about him was that during operations, he talked mainly about one thing with his associates and residents, football. Football was his delight. Dr. Spear has written a memoir about the early days of cardiac, thoracic, and vascular surgery at Harvard, Yale, and Mayo Clinic, and at the start of his career during the early days when Miami was a quiet Southern town, which will be published in the near future. Some of his early Miami adventures included practicing in about ten hospitals, occasionally he would mention them to his family and friends just as a matter of fact, always modestly, he had to cover them all. Before the I-95 expressway was built, Dr. Spear faced the challenge of reaching the hospitals often by back roads, at times in the dark, because as a specialist, he was on call for many emergency rooms. He would say, ""Between midnight and 4:00am, that's when there's trouble."" Yet he never complained about getting up around 2:00am after a long day in surgery, getting dressed in a suit, shirt, and tie, then driving alone through the night in response to the call. Truly, Dr. Spear was a man for others. A private celebration of Dr. Spear's life was held on September 7, 2013. He is survived by his wife, Suzanne Bowmall McLaury Spear, daughters, Laurinda Hope Spear, Alison Leelyn Spear, sister, Nancy Rossbach and family, a son, Harold Charles Spear Ill, MD, sons-in-law, Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Alexander Stevens Reese, grandchildren, Marisa Rose Fort, Alexander Charles Paul Fort, Nicholas McLaury Fort, Raymond August Fort, Harold Emil Fort, Gabriel Bernard Fort, Leslie Caylin Spear, Harold Arthur Spear, Charlotte Rosalind Spear, Jeremy Acheson Spear Platt, Carolina Clare Spear Gomez, Isabella Clementine Bliss Reese and great-grandchildren Gil Spear and Emilia Hope Adams."

Son of Giuseppe and Alessandra (nee Zizzamia), he was raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, attended Stuyvesant High School and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1951 with a BA in English. After honorable discharge from the U.S. Army 112th Infantry Regiment for service during the Korean War, he earned his Masters in English from Columbia University. He then began teaching technical writing at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, Columbia University and NYU. By 1970, he had moved his family to Westfield, NJ. There, he founded and ran Metascience, Inc., teaching writing and communications skills critical to the scientists and engineers of Bell Labs, Exxon, Aramco, General Foods, Union Carbide, Ciba-Geigy Alcoa, Rohm & Haas and others. In the world of martial arts, Charles was instrumental in the formation of what's now known as the U. S. Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation and served as its first Chairman. He retired to Brielle in 2003, in a house he and his wife, Olga (nee Balas), designed, to be near his grandchildren. There, he was able to pursue his passions for reading, gardening and cooking.

2013-10-01T00:00:00Z,"BLYTH--Jeffrey. March 20, 1926 - September 21, 2013. Jeffrey Blyth traveled the world for many years as a foreign correspondent for The London Daily Mail. For most of the time he was based in New York. Major stories he covered included the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, (and the subsequent shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police headquarters), the killing of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles, Chappaquiddick, and Castro's takeover of Cuba. Before that he covered Grace Kelly's wedding, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution and the building of the Berlin Wall. His travels took him all over the world. In fact there were only two major countries he never visited: Australia and New Zealand. The reason, as he once explained to the Australian ambassador, was because neither country had experienced a revolution. But he did cover stories in virtually every country in South America, Europe, Africa and Asia--including Vietnam. He accompanied President Eisenhower to his ""peace trips"" to the Middle East and Asia. Blyth, born in 1926 in South Shields, started in journalism at the age of 16 as a ""cub reporter"" on the Shields Gazette. His salary, seven shillings a week. Later he worked in the Newcastle office of the Northern Echo. During WWII he was a soldier journalist, working for the British Army newspaper Union Jack in Italy. After the war he joined the now defunct News Chronicle, and then was appointed shipping correspondent for the Daily Mail in Southampton. It was there he scored his first big scoop--discovering the car in which the famous runaway spies Burgess and MacLean had fled London and then abandoned in the Southampton docks. It was the first clue to how the renegades had left Britain. Years later he discovered when he met Guy Burgess in Moscow that had even been with them in the bar of the ship in which they fled Britain without knowing it. His overseas years began when he was appointed the Daily Mail's European roving correspondent, based in Paris. He scooped the world with an exclusive interview with Prince Rainier just before his wedding to Grace Kelly. In 1957 he was sent to New York where he was the Chief US correspondent for almost 15 years. After the Mail he worked as a New York correspondent for the BBC and the South African Broadcasting Company, filing daily radio reports. At the same time he set up a company in New York, called Interpress, filing regular weekly reports on show business, media and travel for various British publications including Press Gazette for which he wrote a popular weekly column. He was one of the early members of the Overseas Press Club and a past president of the Foreign Press Association. He leaves his wife Myrna, his sons, Jonathan and Graham, and two grandchildren. He was a great journalist, an admired colleague and a much loved husband and father. Memorial service November 2nd at 3pm at the House of the Redeemer, 7 East 95th Street."

2013-10-02T00:00:00Z,"SUSSER--Phyllis L. (August, 24, 1938 - September 30, 2013) The Board of Directors and Staff of Birch Family Services, Inc. are saddened by the passing of our Founding Director, Phyllis L. Susser. Phyllis was a visionary, a pioneer, and a leader for social change for the disenfranchised, using her considerable intelligence and energy to advocate for those with severe developmental disabilities and social and behavioral challenges, helping them to live their lives as fully and independently as possible. Inspired by her teacher and mentor, Herbert G. Birch, M.D., she began the Herbert G. Birch School for Exceptional Children in 1975 with 28 students and 11 staff members, and she built that program into an agency that now operates educational, residential, adult day and other programs in 23 different sites throughout New York City, serving more than 1,300 people annually. (Our flagship school was re-named the Phyllis L. Susser School for Exceptional Children in April 2006.) Phyllis also was never afraid to serve the socially ostracized. Even when it was not widely accepted, Phyllis opened the doors of Birch's early childhood centers and residences to infants, toddlers and preschoolers affected by HIV/AIDS. She established one of the first camp programs for families living with HIV, staffed almost entirely by volunteers. She was relentless and selfless in her pursuits, and always persevered until she successfully accomplished her mission. No one worked harder or cared more deeply about the people she served. Without Phyllis's inspiration, vision, and determination, Birch Family Services, Inc. would not exist. The Board and Staff honor her memory and pledge to keep her legacy alive. We extend our deepest condolences to her daughter, Kim Susser and her husband, Jordan Cohen, grandsons Charlie and Ethan Cohen, her sister, Sherry Katz, nephew, Andrew Stern, and her family. She will be dearly missed. Robin E. Keller, Esq. Chairman Gerald F. Maurer, Ph.D., President, CEO"

She fervently supported Sunrise Florida Jewish Center, was active in National Hadassah and was past President of Sunrise Hadassah.

2013-10-02T00:00:00Z,"BLYTH--Jeffrey. March 20, 1926 - September 21, 2013. Jeffrey Blyth traveled the world for many years as a foreign correspondent for The London Daily Mail. For most of the time he was based in New York. Major stories he covered included the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, (and the subsequent shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of the Dallas Police headquarters), the killing of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles, Chappaquiddick, and Castro's takeover of Cuba. Before that he covered Grace Kelly's wedding, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution and the building of the Berlin Wall. His travels took him all over the world. In fact there were only two major countries he never visited: Australia and New Zealand. The reason, as he once explained to the Australian ambassador, was because neither country had experienced a revolution. But he did cover stories in virtually every country in South America, Europe, Africa and Asia--including Vietnam. He accompanied President Eisenhower to his ""peace trips"" to the Middle East and Asia. Blyth, born in 1926 in South Shields, started in journalism at the age of 16 as a ""cub reporter"" on the Shields Gazette. His salary, seven shillings a week. Later he worked in the Newcastle office of the Northern Echo. During WWII he was a soldier journalist, working for the British Army newspaper Union Jack in Italy. After the war he joined the now defunct News Chronicle, and then was appointed shipping correspondent for the Daily Mail in Southampton. It was there he scored his first big scoop--discovering the car in which the famous runaway spies Burgess and MacLean had fled London and then abandoned in the Southampton docks. It was the first clue to how the renegades had left Britain. Years later he discovered when he met Guy Burgess in Moscow that had even been with them in the bar of the ship in which they fled Britain without knowing it. His overseas years began when he was appointed the Daily Mail's European roving correspondent, based in Paris. He scooped the world with an exclusive interview with Prince Rainier just before his wedding to Grace Kelly. In 1957 he was sent to New York where he was the Chief US correspondent for almost 15 years. After the Mail he worked as a New York correspondent for the BBC and the South African Broadcasting Company, filing daily radio reports. At the same time he set up a company in New York, called Interpress, filing regular weekly reports on show business, media and travel for various British publications including Press Gazette for which he wrote a popular weekly column. He was one of the early members of the Overseas Press Club and a past president of the Foreign Press Association. He leaves his wife Myrna, his sons, Jonathan and Graham, and two grandchildren. He was a great journalist, an admired colleague and a much loved husband and father. Memorial service November 2nd at 3pm at the House of the Redeemer, 7 East 95th Street."

In the 1950s, under the stage name Monica Lane, June joined crooner Cass Franklin as a popular singing duo playing New York nightclubs such as The Latin Quarter, pioneer television variety shows such as The Colgate Comedy Hour, and Catskills resorts (Monica's publicity pin-up became the source material for Roy Lichtenstein's famous ""Girl With Ball,"" in NYC's MoMA). In 1953, June married John Springer, whose career as a film and theater public relations agent became legend. With John, she enjoyed the glamour of the New York and international entertainment, arts and journalism worlds, but she was far more devoted to family: children Gary, Alicia, and Cynthia; grandchildren Nicholas and Olivia Springer, Zachary Gilman, and Anthony and Zora Thomas; and her sister Marilyn and family.

2013-10-04T00:00:00Z,"SPRINGER--June Reimer, of New York City, died peacefully on September 27, 2013 in Chico, CA at the age of 85. Born in 1928 in Hackensack, NJ to Alice and Rudolph Reimer, she grew up in Bogota NJ. June became a professional singer at 18, appearing in several musicals on Broadway (including ""Kiss Me Kate"" for which she recalled auditioning before Cole Porter; Sigmund Romberg's ""My Romance;"" and ""Three Wishes For Jamie,"" among others); and on national tours including Romberg's ""The Student Prince"", in which she starred as the Princess. In the 1950s, under the stage name Monica Lane, June joined crooner Cass Franklin as a popular singing duo playing New York nightclubs such as The Latin Quarter, pioneer television variety shows such as The Colgate Comedy Hour, and Catskills resorts (Monica's publicity pin-up became the source material for Roy Lichtenstein's famous ""Girl With Ball,"" in NYC's MoMA). In 1953, June married John Springer, whose career as a film and theater public relations agent became legend. With John, she enjoyed the glamour of the New York and international entertainment, arts and journalism worlds, but she was far more devoted to family: children Gary, Alicia, and Cynthia; grandchildren Nicholas and Olivia Springer, Zachary Gilman, and Anthony and Zora Thomas; and her sister Marilyn and family. Warm, funny, beautiful, and generous, June was beloved by loyal friends and family. A Memorial will be held later in October in New York City at the Players Club."

Suzy was a rare woman. She was a vibrant wife, mother, grandmother and friend whose limitless enthusiasm, infinite energy, and genuine interest in others was a truly extraordinary gift to all who knew her. She was 100% engaged in anything and everything that mattered to everyone she loved. She made every single person she knew whether for a few minutes or for a lifetime feel like they mattered. For Suzy, they genuinely did, as she sincerely wanted happiness and good fortune for all in her orbit. The ultimate fan and supporter, she never missed a chance to cheer on her children, and later her grandchildren. She created homes that were the active center of her children and their friends' lives. Her door was always opened, her refrigerator always stocked, and there always was room for another to join the dinner table. Suzy was fun, deeply loyal, and always positive. She was competitive and relentlessly curious. Suzy was a knock-out, both inside and out. But most important of all, Suzy had fierce and boundless love for her family and many friends. It was matched only by theirs for her. She is survived by Tony, her husband of 47 years; her children Collins (Sam) Baker, Sally, and Mark (Carolyn) Whaling, and her five grandchildren: Will and Jake Baker, Caden, Lilly and Beau Whaling, her beloved Reilly and pre-deceased by her son Tyler. In honor of Suzy's life, donations may be made to the Tyler Whaling Colgate University Scholarship Fund.

An avid sailor, he grew up in Kings Point, learning to sail when he was seven years old and spending much time as a teenager sailing and racing on Long Island Sound. After earning a BA from Bates College and MBA from the Harvard Business School, he served for three years as an officer in the US Army Finance Corps and embarked on a career that culminated in founding, with his colleague Ira Sahlman, a chain of retail fabric stores and a highly successful textile converting business, the Tussah Company. He retired in 1992 to be able to spend more time travelling during school vacations with his wife, Evy, then Head of the Brearley School, and to pursue a vast array of shared interests and experiences among them tennis and sailing with family and friends, theater, opera, ballet, museum-going and chamber music (he began studying the cello in his late twenties and attained a modest level of competence which enabled him to enjoy playing slow movements of Mozart and Beethoven trios and quartets with far more accomplished amateurs). He was a Fellow for Life of the Metropolitan Museum (thanks to a gift his family made to the Costume Institute in memory of his father, the US manufacturer for Jacques Fath), and early in his career he was President of the Wiltwyck School for Boys, a residential treatment center for troubled, delinquent, court-referred teenagers.

In 1985, together with Father John Andrew (XI Rector 1972-1996), the Wardens and Vestry, and architect Harold Buttrick, Mr. Clem played a key role in planning and executing the move of the Choir School from West 55th Street to its present location to a new building designed and built for the purpose on West 58th Street; the move was accomplished in 1987. The new building was named ""Gordon Clem House;"" Mr. Clem's name is carved on the cornerstone. Mr. Clem retired as Headmaster in 1995. There will be a memorial service for Mr. Clem on Sunday, October 13 at 4pm at Saint Thomas Church, 5th Ave. and 53rd Street. Rector Wardens Vestry Headmaster Saint Thomas Church and Choir School"

During her time at Yachting she traveled the world extensively as a journalist and sailor and crewed on several boats competing in the New York to Bermuda regatta. Following retirement, like Grandma Moses, she became an avid painter and beloved figure at the Students' Art League. Her travels continued and took her above the Arctic Circle twice, to Antarctica, the Galapagos Islands, Europe, Scandinavia, Egypt and heli-hiking in British Columbia at age 88. She was an active member of the New York Yacht Club and served on the membership committee for many years. Her active mind, keen interest in art and politics, generosity, loyalty, independence and kindness were in evidence until the end and appreciated by all who knew her.

2013-10-07T00:00:00Z,"HALPERT--Edward R.,Died September 29 in New York City of complications of Parkinson's Disease. He was 80 years old. Gracious, competent, sensible, generous and kind, Ed had a long and notably happy life, enriched by his extraordinary gift for friendship and by his devotion to his wife and to their children and grandchildren, sources of enormous pride and joy to him. An avid sailor, he grew up in Kings Point, learning to sail when he was seven years old and spending much time as a teenager sailing and racing on Long Island Sound. After earning a BA from Bates College and MBA from the Harvard Business School, he served for three years as an officer in the US Army Finance Corps and embarked on a career that culminated in founding, with his colleague Ira Sahlman, a chain of retail fabric stores and a highly successful textile converting business, the Tussah Company. He retired in 1992 to be able to spend more time travelling during school vacations with his wife, Evy, then Head of the Brearley School, and to pursue a vast array of shared interests and experiences among them tennis and sailing with family and friends, theater, opera, ballet, museum-going and chamber music (he began studying the cello in his late twenties and attained a modest level of competence which enabled him to enjoy playing slow movements of Mozart and Beethoven trios and quartets with far more accomplished amateurs). He was a Fellow for Life of the Metropolitan Museum (thanks to a gift his family made to the Costume Institute in memory of his father, the US manufacturer for Jacques Fath), and early in his career he was President of the Wiltwyck School for Boys, a residential treatment center for troubled, delinquent, court-referred teenagers. He later served on the Board of the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (now renamed the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation) and on the Board of Prep for Prep, an academic program which prepares minority students for admission to independent schools. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Evelyn J. Halpert, their two sons, James J. Halpert of Washington, DC and David C. Halpert of Singapore, and four grandsons, Sam, Daniel, Rustam and Ramsey, all of whom miss him terribly. A celebration in his memory will be held at the Century Association, 7 West 43rd St, at 5:30pm on Thursday, October 17.

2013-10-08T00:00:00Z,"SIMMONS--Christopher. Christopher DeWitt Simmons, of Alexandria, Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts died on October 3, 2013, in his sleep. He is survived by his wife, Laura McIntosh Simmons, children Tucker McIntosh Simmons and Charlotte Bleecker Simmons, all of Alexandria, Virginia; his father, Richard DeLacey Simmons, former President of the Washington Post Company, also of Alexandria; his sister Robin Simmons Turner (Eric), niece Merrill and nephews Brooks and Griffin of Arlington, Virginia. Born on April 19, 1963, in Huntington, New York, Christopher was the son of Richard and the late Mary Bleecker Simmons. A gifted athlete, at Deerfield Academy, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, he was a member of the school's football and lacrosse teams. Christopher attended Duke University and received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in fine arts and art history from Tufts University. He also held a degree with a concentration in painting and drawing from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, receiving its highest artistic prize, The Boit Award, in his first year. Christopher was an inveterate traveler, visiting all seven of the world's continents. He was one of the first Americans to travel to China after Nixon's historic visit and to Vietnam in 1994. An accomplished artist, his travels were reflected in his art. Christopher's signature mixed media technique merged photography and painting, documenting the monochromatic landscape of Antarctica as poetically as the Soviet Pacific fleet in Vladivostok and the desert refuge of WWII American planes in Arizona. Galleries in Washington, DC, Los Angeles, New Jersey and New York City showed his work. Christopher was intimately involved in his children's lives much to their benefit. He was active in their sporting activities; including coaching his daughter's youth lacrosse team and expanding his son's winning club swim team. Christopher devoted a significant effort to fundraising for Saint Stephens and St. Agnes School, Alexandria, Virginia and Washington DC's St. John's College High School. He was a member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Belle Haven Country Club, Farmington Country Club and the Mill Reef Club.

She is survived by her husband Paul, daughter Corey, son Zachary, grandson Dylan, mom Betty, and brother, Scott. Denny's children and grandson were the pride and joy of her life. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she received her undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland and her M.S. from Barry College. She and her husband Paul, co-founder of FMSbonds, Inc., met in Maryland. They married a year after graduation and settled in Florida, where they resided for more than 40 years. Although family meant everything to Denny, she always made time for ""giving back"" and worked tirelessly to comfort those in need. She was active in The Greater Miami Jewish Federation and a founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art but her true passion, even before contracting breast cancer, was supporting cancer research at The University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Denny was a founding member of ""Friends for Sylvester"" and sat on the Sylvester Board of Governors, as well as co-chairing the Board of the Founder's Society. Her proudest achievement, which will become her legacy, was the creation of ""Coupons for a Cure,"" a program that facilitated donations to Sylvester in honor of a person or event. This overwhelmingly successful program raises a significant amount of money annually to combat cancer, and will do so well into the future. Denny was an inspiration to all who knew her. Right up until the end, other cancer patients continually looked to Denny for support, marveling at her unceasing optimism and positive mental attitude. Denny died peacefully at home, surrounded by her loving family. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, October 9, at 11:30am, at Temple Beth Sholom, 4144 Chase Avenue, in Miami Beach, Florida.

2013-10-13T00:00:00Z,"KEHRL--Howard Harmon. Former General Motors Vice Chairman, age 90, passed away peacefully on October 1, 2013 at his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Born February 2, 1923 in Detroit, he was raised by his mother Martha, who had emigrated from Germany. The Great Depression was a very challenging time for the family. Fortunately, Howard was an excellent student and earned a scholarship to Wayne State University. At Wayne State, he met the love of his life, Mary Katherine Maloney. Howard and Mary were happily married for 67 years and raised four children. An affinity for cars and all things mechanical distinguished Howard from an early age. He enjoyed fast cars in his teens and supported himself in school by selling cars he rebuilt. His career at General Motors began in the Research Laboratories in 1948. Positions at Cadillac, Chevrolet and Oldsmobile eventually led to his appointment as Chief Engineer and then General Manager of Oldsmobile. Later, he became Executive Vice President in charge of the General Motors technical and planning staffs and responsible for the company's international operations, before assuming the Vice Chairman post from 1981 to 1986. Howard was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in recognition of his contributions to automotive science and engineering. Howard left Wayne State to enlist in the Navy during World War II. Commissioned an Ensign after completing the Naval Officers Training Program, he taught engineering courses in the Notre Dame Midshipmen's School. He earned engineering degrees from Illinois Institute of Technology (Bachelors) and the University of Notre Dame (Masters). Later, General Motors sponsored him as a Sloan Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he achieved his Master's degree in industrial management. Boards on which Howard served included the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, General Motors, the GM Cancer Research Foundation (where he served as Vice Chairman), Target Corporation (lead outside director), and the United Negro College Fund (Chairman of the Board). Howard and his wife Mary created an endowed scholarship fund at Wayne State for undergraduate science and engineering students, and have been active supporters of Bravo, a theatre support group, and other charitable organizations. Many of Howard's happiest times involved his family and the outdoors. His favorite places included Michigan's Walloon Lake; the mountains of Colorado and the Pacific Coast in California. Memorable vacations included cross country treks in the family car. He is fondly remembered for his use of the principles of torque and other engineering concepts in teaching his family to ski. Another vehicle for sharing his love of the outdoors was what his grandchildren called Camp Grandpa Bud (a family nickname), time alone with their grandfather including wilderness camping adventures. Howard and Mary particularly loved the grandeur of the mountains, and spent their early retirement years in Aspen, Colorado before settling in California. Howard is survived by his wife Mary; his children Dr. John Kehrl (Dr. Claudia Cicala), Dr. Howard Kehrl (Pamela Moore), David Kehrl (Alida) and Kathy Blenko (David); his grandchildren Tom, Brian, Jason, Ryan, Laura, Jenny, Peter and Matthew and six great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by two sisters, Dorothy and Judy. The memorial service will be held at Wayfarer's Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, California at 5:30pm on Sunday, October 13, 2013. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Wayne State University (c/o Wayne State University Fund Office, 5475 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, MI 48202)."

2013-10-13T00:00:00Z,"HENTZEN--Robert K. Robert K. ""Bob"" Hentzen, president and co-founder of Christian Foundation for Children and Aging (CFCA), the largest charitable organization in Kansas, died on Tuesday in Guatemala. He was 77. Hentzen, his siblings and a family friend started CFCA, an international sponsorship organization, in his basement in 1981. They began their adventure with a Christmas card list and a calling to serve the poor. Today, CFCA works in 21 developing countries around the world and is one of the 200 largest nonprofits in the United States. It serves more than 300,000 children and aging people and their families. More than $1 billion in direct aid has been distributed to benefit families in CFCA programs. ""Bob walked right into the hearts of people in poverty all over the world,"" said CFCA CEO Paco Wertin. ""He built bridges across divides."" In 1996, Hentzen set out on foot from CFCA headquarters in Kansas City, KS., and walked to Guatemala as an act of solidarity with the poor. It was in Guatemala that he and his wife, Cristina, settled. ""He fell in love with the poor through personal encounters,"" said CFCA Global Strategy Director Paul Pearce. ""He could never be the same after that."" In 2009, Hentzen embarked on his second walk, an even bigger challenge. He walked more than 8,000 miles from Guatemala to Chile through 12 countries. Thousands of families and supporters joined him during the 18-month trek. ""Society has told them all along that they are not capable,"" Hentzen said during the walk, in a reference to families living in poverty. ""We are here to tell them they are quite capable. 'You are not alone. We are walking with you.' "" Hentzen died unexpectedly October 8, 2013, of natural causes. He was the last surviving member of CFCA's five founders. But the mission and work of CFCA will continue. Bob is survived by his wife, Cristina, six children, 11 grandchildren, seven sponsored children, many nieces and nephews and an international circle of friends that numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Hentzen will be laid to rest in San Lucas Toliman, Guatemala, on Saturday, October 12, 2013. A memorial Mass will be held later in the church where Hentzen grew up in Kansas City, MO.

Doerfler, Hearst Corporation director, trustee and senior vice president, finance and administration, died Friday, October 11, in Brick, N.J. after a brief hospitalization. He was 72. Doerfler, whose career at Hearst Corporation spanned 15 years, had responsibility for Hearst's finance and accounting activities, and also oversaw Hearst's New York real estate holdings. He was elected to Hearst's Board of Directors in June 2002 and was a testamentary trustee under the will of William Randolph Hearst since 2008. Doerfler represented Hearst on the board of directors of A+E Networks during virtually his entire tenure at Hearst. ""The passing of Ron Doerfler is not only a loss to Hearst, but to associates across the media community,"" said Steven R. Swartz, president & CEO of Hearst Corporation. ""He was an outstanding executive, providing our management team with valuable strategic and transactional guidance throughout his career. He will be greatly missed."" ""Ron was a part of Hearst for more than 15 years and our partner before that in his roles at Cap Cities, ABC and Disney,"" said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman, Hearst Corporation. ""His financial expertise stretched across nearly every line of business Hearst is engaged in, and he was an integral part of Hearst's major transactions since 1998, including: the Pulitzer broadcasting group acquisition, creation of Hearst Television, the A+E Networks and Lifetime merger, the Mark Burnett partnership and the addition of Lagardere's magazine titles. Most importantly though, Ron was a close friend. Those of us in the Hearst family who had the privilege to work with Ron will miss him greatly."" Doerfler joined Hearst as vice president and chief financial officer in 1998 and was elected senior vice president in March 2000. Prior to Hearst, he was senior vice president and chief financial officer at ABC, Inc., and at its predecessor Capital Cities/ABC. Doerfler joined Capital Cities Communications in 1969 as assistant controller and was appointed treasurer in 1977, and senior vice president and chief financial officer in 1980. He played a major role in Capital Cities' acquisition of ABC, Inc., in 1986 and again in the 1996 Capital Cities/ABC merger with The Walt Disney Company.

He was a former chairman of the board of the Broadcast Cable Financial Management Association and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Doerfler sat on the board of trustees of Fairleigh Dickinson University, his alma mater, and the Museum of the Moving Image, and served on the board of directors of the Arts & Business Council. In 2007, he was awarded Fairleigh Dickinson's Charter Day Award, which honors individuals who have distinguished themselves as outstanding leaders in their professions and their communities. Doerfler was a member of the board of directors for Lazard, the financial advisory and asset management firm, from 2006 to 2011. He was also instrumental in the planning and construction of Hearst Corporation's award-winning Hearst Tower, which opened in 2006. Doerfler, born in Jersey City, N.J., graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University with a degree in accounting and became a CPA in 1967. He received an MBA, magna cum laude, from Fairleigh Dickinson in 1972. He is survived by his wife, Krystyna, daughter Stephanie and granddaughter Alexandra Casteele. Funeral services are private.

2013-10-20T00:00:00Z,"SCHWEBEL--Milton, a psychologist at the forefront of postwar educational reform and peace psychology, died October 3 in Tucson, Ariz. He was 99. For over a half century Professor Schwebel examined how the public school as an institution shaped expectations about children's capacity to learn. His best-known book, ""Who Can Be Educated?,"" was published in 1968, when much of the country was resisting court-ordered school desegregation and believed integration would erode school quality. His most recent book, ""Remaking America's Three School Systems: Now Separate and Unequal,"" published in the aftermath of No Child Left Behind, examines how United States schools continue to shortchange children, especially disadvantaged youth. Schwebel also co-edited, with Jane Raph, the influential book, ""Piaget in the Classroom."" Schwebel was among the pioneer researchers to investigate children's anxiety about nuclear war. He spearheaded efforts to create the American Psychological Association's ""Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence: Peace Psychology"" and was the founding editor of the association's journal Peace and Conflict. Throughout his career, the cause of education, social justice, and peace were linked. He argued in his first academic article, published in 1940, that to be strong, a nation needed more than a powerful army; it needed to provide youth with opportunities for education and economic security. Schwebel came of age during the Great Depression. He entered Union College at age 16, majoring in Philosophy. He earned an MA in Human Development and American Civilization from SUNY-Albany. After his marriage to Bernice Davison, he served as a cottage parent at the Hebrew Orphan Asylum and worked for the National Youth Administration. He served in the European Theater during World War II. After earning his Ph.D. from Columbia, he taught at several institutions, including New York University and Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education (Dean).

2013-10-20T00:00:00Z,"SCHEIMER--Louis ""Lou"" (October 19, 1928 - October 17, 2013) Los Angeles, CA - Louis Scheimer, the renowned and much loved animation pioneer has died at his home at age 84, just two days shy of his 85th birthday, from Parkinson's Disease. Lou is survived by his beloved daughter Erika Scheimer and his son Lane Scheimer. At his side over these final days were Erika, who worked with her father for decades at Filmation, the company founded by Lou, Norm Prescott, and Hal Sutherland in the early sixties. Also on hand throughout Lou's final days were his devoted daughter-in-law, Amy Rosenberg, and sundry close friends, former employees and relations. Lou's wife Jay Scheimer, had passed in 2009. Lou often said that Jay was truly the woman behind the man, and she was greatly instrumental in making Filmation a reality. He often said that he could never have survived the early years without Jay's support. They were a most colorful couple; back in the day, some referred to them as the ""George and Gracie"" of the animation crowd. Lou graduated from Carnegie-Tech in 1952, married in 1953 and moved to Los Angeles in 1955 to work in the animation industry. In 1962, Filmation Studios was created and became one of the world's premiere animation houses. During this early period, the studio produced TV commercials and documentaries. In 1965, the studio unveiled its first Saturday morning series, ""Superman"", a solid hit which ran for three years on CBS. Soon to follow were a string of shows, including the arrival of ""Aquaman"", ""Batman"" and the phenomenally rated ""Archies"" show. Lou was widely credited with starting Saturday morning cartoons. From the ""Archies"" cartoons came the number one hit song ""Sugar, Sugar"", which has been re-recorded through the years some 29 times and counting! It was also the number two song of the 1960's, second only to the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"". A number one song from a cartoon? This was the first animated show to include original songs with each episode. This was one of many ""firsts"" achieved throughout the life of Filmation. The praise from critics and viewers alike was even more enthusiastic for Filmation's proudest animation achievement, ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"". In its twelve year run, ""Fat Albert"" was acclaimed by parents, educators and children everywhere. It received countless honors, including a number of Emmy nominations and the prestigious Peabody Award. It was the show that Lou was most proud of. From then on, he made it his life's mission to produce children's shows that not only were entertaining, but also contained pro-social values and messages. After ""Fat Albert"" aired in the early seventies, Filmation had truly come into its own as a giant in the field of animation. Shows broadcast on CBS, NBC and ABC in that time period include ""Groovie Ghoulies"", ""The Brady Kids"", ""Mission Magic"", ""Jerry Lewis"", the ""Fabulous Funnies"", ""Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle"", ""Tom and Jerry"", ""Space Sentinels"", ""Lassie"", and ""Gilligans Island"". Subsequently, Lou ventured into live-action shows with such hits as ""Shazam-Isis Hour"", the original ""Ghostbusters"", ""Ark II"", ""Space Academy"" and ""Jason of Star Command"". In addition, Filmation made a triumphant foray into theatrical feature production with ""Journey Back to Oz"" in 1973. That year also marked the first of many prime time specials, including ""Oliver Twist"", ""Treasure Island"", ""Fat Albert"" and ""A Snow White Christmas"". In 1981, Filmation unveiled ""Blackstarr"", a sword and sorcery fantasy that rocketed to the top of the Saturday morning ratings. This was not surprising considering Filmation's acknowledged leadership in producing quality animated adventure shows. Beginning with ""Fantastic Voyage"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" in 1967, the studio went on to produce the now classic, Emmy award winning animated ""Star Trek"" series, as well as animated versions of ""Tarzan"", ""Zorro"", ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Flash Gordon."" In 1983, Lou created the marketplace for first-run syndication of animated shows. Filmation took on its most ambitious project to date: the ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" series. Over the years Filmation produced 130 ""He-Man"" episodes directly for syndication. Once again, Lou made positive messages a hallmark of the show. The results: another winner, both in domestic ratings and in unprecedented international sales in thirty countries in the first year alone. Two years later, in 1985, Filmation brought He-Man's twin sister ""She-Ra, Princess of Power"" to the syndicated world. Lou always felt that little girls were underserved in the world of super heroes. He made it a cause to change that with She-Ra. It too was a huge success at home and abroad. After Filmation closed, the now legendary Lou Scheimer had grown to be one of the most loved men in the animation industry. He became known for trying to keep animation in the US, and he fought hard to do so. Additionally, it was of great importance to him that Filmation train the next generation of animators in America. Many of Lou's former employees can, to this day, be found working at Disney, DreamWorks, Pixar and more. Indeed, many will tell you that it was Lou who gave them their start in the business. Lou's legacy of shows saw a whole new life in recent years, as DVD collections of his many shows began to proliferate in the 1990's. The fact that a new generation of kids would be able to watch his Filmation shows gave Lou endless joy. Hundreds of fan mail letters and emails just keep on coming. Google the guy and read all about it. It is a great American rags-to-riches story you will much enjoy. In lieu of flowers, Lou and his family kindly request that donations to Parkinson's research be made in his honor."

Her father was the founder of the restaurant chain Howard Johnson's, recognized as the largest restaurant chain in the world throughout the 1960's and 1970's. Mr. Johnson started the business with single soda fountain in 1925. Mrs. Henry was educated at the Dana Hall School in Wellesley, MA before continuing on to Briarcliffe Junior College and the New York School of Interior Design. Mrs. Henry's greatest passion was her family. Her two sons, William and Joshua were her greatest sources of pride and devotion. Throughout her life she served on many boards and committees, including the Boys and Girls Club of Greenwich and the board of Tabor Academy. She also served as the director of the Howard Johnson Foundation for many years. She loved to socialize, and was a hostess without equal. She will be remembered as a woman who held her door open for friends and family, as she delighted in bringing people together. She enjoyed memberships of the Jupiter Island Club, the Field Club of Greenwich, the Colony Club of New York City, and perhaps her favorite, the Edgartown Yacht Club, where she organized dances and was formerly the head of senior entertainment and a member of the House Committee. Mrs. Henry was an avid traveler throughout her life, visiting countless countries while delighting in taking her growing family of children and grandchildren with her. Though a resident of Greenwich, CT, she shared a deep love for Martha's Vineyard, where she summered for over fifty years. She was a lover of culture, rare antiques, and beautiful interiors, with her taste greatly influenced by her travels and studies. Her attention to detail, gracious hospitality and devotion to style will be her legacy for many years to come. Mrs. Henry was deeply beloved and is survived by her brother, Howard Brennan Johnson and his family, her two sons, William and Joshua, her daughters-in-law, Olivia and Christine, her six grandchildren and one great-grandchild, though many more thought of ""Dottie"" as family as well.

2013-10-21T00:00:00Z,"EDELMAN--Ruth. Ruth Edelman, deputy chairman of DJE Holdings, parent company of her late husband's eponymous global public relations firm, Edelman, and recognized mental health advocate, died peacefully at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Mrs. Edelman was 84 years old. She was married to Daniel J. Edelman for 59 years prior to his death this past January. Mrs. Edelman is survived by her three children Richard and Renee of New York City and John of Chicago; as well as three granddaughters Margot, Victoria and Amanda Edelman, all of New York City. Throughout her life, Mrs. Edelman was a great supporter of numerous health organizations and nonprofits. She helped to significantly further the goals of the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association through her visibility as a patient advocate and philanthropist. In 1994, Mrs. Edelman became the first individual outside of the medical community to receive the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association's Jan Fawcett Humanitarian Award, which recognizes outstanding contributions to the understanding of depressive illness, commitment to research and sincere devotion to those suffering from depression. She was also an advocate for the Save the Children Foundation, Chicago Project for Violence Prevention and Committee for Economic Growth of Israel. In addition, Mrs. Edelman was active in Chicago's fine arts community, having raised funds for the Lyric Opera Company and the Chicago Art Institute. She worked for former US Senator Charles Percy, helping him organize community events for more than a decade. She would later become the special events chair for the state of Illinois under Governor Jim Thompson. However, Mrs. Edelman is best known as a driving force behind her late husband's success. ""Ruth was a part of Edelman from day one,"" said Richard Edelman. ""My parents created our business and established our culture. My mother had the poise and grace of a sought-after hostess, with the wit and wisdom of a savvy businesswoman. She charmed many a guest into becoming a client."" Ruth Edelman was born Ruth Rozumoff in Racine, Wisconsin in 1929. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an economics major, she moved to Chicago where she met her future husband on a blind date. ""I liked him,"" said Mrs. Edelman, as quoted in Edelman and the Rise of Public Relations by Franz Wisner. ""I liked him because he was smart, refined, a gentleman and hardworking. I wanted him (for my husband) from the first day."" From her marriage to Dan in 1953 until his death earlier this year, Mrs. Edelman nurtured her family as tirelessly as she helped support his company. With Dan often on the road, she oversaw the children's education with exacting standards of excellence. ""It's something that we looked forward to, that our children would live a better life if they got better grades. And they did,"" she said. In addition to her children and granddaughters, Mrs. Edelman is survived by her sister Rosalie Aronin, 86 years old, and her daughters-in-law, Roz Edelman and Susie Krohn. Shiva will be held at the at Casino Club in Chicago and the memorial service will be held at the Temple Sinai in Chicago. The funeral service will be private.

2013-10-22T00:00:00Z,"WYNN--Thomas Francis, III. On January 6, 1944, Thomas Francis Wynn III was born in St. Petersburg, Florida to Thomas and Catherine Wynn. Tom was the eldest of four children and he is survived by his brothers Jack and Bob and sister Kathy. Tom was raised in Fairlawn, New Jersey. His lifetime love for baseball started early with neighborhood games. And just like his idol Willie Mays, Tom ""The Jet"" played center field. Mr. Wynn was a graduate of Fordham University and Fordham Law School. He subsequently enlisted in the U.S. Army, served as Battalion Prosecutor and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1970 as Tom prepared to leave his station in Germany for the war in Vietnam, he received news that his wife of only one year, Linda Evelyn Gerbasi, had died following childbirth. Mr. Wynn was granted honorable discharge and he returned to the United States to find a job and care for his newborn twin girls Laura and Michele. Tom has always said that he was lucky enough to love two women in his life. On February 23, 1974, Ursula Claudina Loor married widower Tom Wynn; she adopted Tom's twin daughters and she gave birth to Thomas Loor Wynn IV and Ursula Mary Wynn. Ursula was the center of Tom's life for nearly 39 years of marriage whether on the dance floor or in the garden they were always together. On October 15, 2012 Ursula was called to the Kingdom of Heaven. Tom is survived by his children Thomas, Ursula and Laura. Michele predeceased both Tom and Ursula. Mr. Wynn is also survived by many friends and family members including his loving daughter-in-law Lysset Wynn and James Decker; and grandchildren Matthew, Thomas, Hank, Tammy and Luke. In 1970, Mr. Wynn joined the NASD Arbitration and Mediation Department (now part of FINRA) and most recently served as the Associate Director of Neutral Training and Development. Throughout his 34-year career, Mr. Wynn served in virtually every area of this department and, at various times, supervised the California, New York and Florida Offices. He was a frequent speaker at NASD and other seminars and developed training programs for Chairpersons. Tom was especially proud of his newsletter The Neutral Corner to which served as the Editor-in-Chief from its inception in 1995 until his retirement in 2004. With great humility, Tom described his role at the NASD as one that seemed to be ""created just for him."" At his core, Mr. Wynn was principled, fair and transparent; and his life's work, therefore, was an expression of himself. On Saturday, October 19, 2013, the Lord granted Tom entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven. Following cremation, we will celebrate Tom's life during a Memorial Mass on Friday, October 25, 2013 at 10:00am in St. Ann's Catholic Church located in Nyack, New York. Finally we ask that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made in the memory of Thomas Francis Wynn III to the Joe Raso Hospice Residence at 415 Buena Vista Road, New City, New York, 10956."

2013-10-23T00:00:00Z,"WYNN--Thomas Francis, III. On January 6, 1944, Thomas Francis Wynn III was born in St. Petersburg, Florida to Thomas and Catherine Wynn. Tom was the eldest of four children and he is survived by his brothers Jack and Bob and sister Kathy. Tom was raised in Fairlawn, New Jersey. His lifetime love for baseball started early with neighborhood games. And just like his idol Willie Mays, Tom ""The Jet"" played center field. Mr. Wynn was a graduate of Fordham University and Fordham Law School. He subsequently enlisted in the U.S. Army, served as Battalion Prosecutor and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1970 as Tom prepared to leave his station in Germany for the war in Vietnam, he received news that his wife of only one year, Linda Evelyn Gerbasi, had died following childbirth. Mr. Wynn was granted honorable discharge and he returned to the United States to find a job and care for his newborn twin girls Laura and Michele. Tom has always said that he was lucky enough to love two women in his life. On February 23, 1974, Ursula Claudina Loor married widower Tom Wynn; she adopted Tom's twin daughters and she gave birth to Thomas Loor Wynn IV and Ursula Mary Wynn. Ursula was the center of Tom's life for nearly 39 years of marriage whether on the dance floor or in the garden they were always together. On October 15, 2012 Ursula was called to the Kingdom of Heaven. Tom is survived by his children Thomas, Ursula and Laura. Michele predeceased both Tom and Ursula. Mr. Wynn is also survived by many friends and family members including his loving daughter-in-law Lysset Wynn and James Decker; and grandchildren Matthew, Thomas, Hank, Tammy and Luke. In 1970, Mr. Wynn joined the NASD Arbitration and Mediation Department (now part of FINRA) and most recently served as the Associate Director of Neutral Training and Development. Throughout his 34-year career, Mr. Wynn served in virtually every area of this department and, at various times, supervised the California, New York and Florida Offices. He was a frequent speaker at NASD and other seminars and developed training programs for Chairpersons. Tom was especially proud of his newsletter The Neutral Corner to which served as the Editor-in-Chief from its inception in 1995 until his retirement in 2004. With great humility, Tom described his role at the NASD as one that seemed to be ""created just for him."" At his core, Mr. Wynn was principled, fair and transparent; and his life's work, therefore, was an expression of himself. On Saturday, October 19, 2013, the Lord granted Tom entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven. Following cremation, we will celebrate Tom's life during a Memorial Mass on Friday, October 25, 2013 at 10:00am in St. Ann's Catholic Church located in Nyack, New York. Finally we ask that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made in the memory of Thomas Francis Wynn III to the Joe Raso Hospice Residence at 415 Buena Vista Road, New City, New York, 10956."

October 15, 1915 - October 18, 2013, died at home in Bedminster, New Jersey, following a brief illness on Friday, October 18, in the company of family and God. Blessed with a sharp mind, he lived to be 98 years strong! Walter was a humble, intelligent, undemanding and dignified man who loved his family, the Catholic Church, automobiles of any kind and the New York Yankees. Born in the Bronx, New York, Walter worked for the IRT System as a clerk and photographer before entering the New York City Police Department in 1943. Within the NYPD, he rose to the rank of Gold Shield Detective in the Photography Unit of the Homicide Division of the 48th Precinct, before retiring in 1969.

He is survived by his four children James Selkaitis, Joan Selkaitis, Karen Stanhope and Susan Hart, and his only grandchild, Caroline Hart, for whom he held a special place in his heart. He considered his daughter-in-law, Betty Selkaitis, and son-in-law, Bradford Hart, to be his own children, loving them with equal care. He left us with many words of wisdom as he departed this earth, and we hope we can live up to his high standards and strong beliefs as well as he did. The extended Selkaitis family would like to thank the many hospice and health care professionals who helped Walter and our family throughout his final days.

2013-10-24T00:00:00Z,"WYNN--Thomas Francis, III. On January 6, 1944, Thomas Francis Wynn III was born in St. Petersburg, Florida to Thomas and Catherine Wynn. Tom was the eldest of four children and he is survived by his brothers Jack and Bob and sister Kathy. Tom was raised in Fairlawn, New Jersey. His lifetime love for baseball started early with neighborhood games. And just like his idol Willie Mays, Tom ""The Jet"" played center field. Mr. Wynn was a graduate of Fordham University and Fordham Law School. He subsequently enlisted in the U.S. Army, served as Battalion Prosecutor and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1970 as Tom prepared to leave his station in Germany for the war in Vietnam, he received news that his wife of only one year, Linda Evelyn Gerbasi, had died following childbirth. Mr. Wynn was granted honorable discharge and he returned to the United States to find a job and care for his newborn twin girls Laura and Michele. Tom has always said that he was lucky enough to love two women in his life. On February 23, 1974, Ursula Claudina Loor married widower Tom Wynn; she adopted Tom's twin daughters and she gave birth to Thomas Loor Wynn IV and Ursula Mary Wynn. Ursula was the center of Tom's life for nearly 39 years of marriage whether on the dance floor or in the garden they were always together. On October 15, 2012 Ursula was called to the Kingdom of Heaven. Tom is survived by his children Thomas, Ursula and Laura. Michele predeceased both Tom and Ursula. Mr. Wynn is also survived by many friends and family members including his loving daughter-in-law Lysset Wynn and James Decker; and grandchildren Matthew, Thomas, Hank, Tammy and Luke. In 1970, Mr. Wynn joined the NASD Arbitration and Mediation Department (now part of FINRA) and most recently served as the Associate Director of Neutral Training and Development. Throughout his 34-year career, Mr. Wynn served in virtually every area of this department and, at various times, supervised the California, New York and Florida Offices. He was a frequent speaker at NASD and other seminars and developed training programs for Chairpersons. Tom was especially proud of his newsletter The Neutral Corner to which served as the Editor-in-Chief from its inception in 1995 until his retirement in 2004. With great humility, Tom described his role at the NASD as one that seemed to be ""created just for him."" At his core, Mr. Wynn was principled, fair and transparent; and his life's work, therefore, was an expression of himself. On Saturday, October 19, 2013, the Lord granted Tom entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven. Following cremation, we will celebrate Tom's life during a Memorial Mass on Friday, October 25, 2013 at 10:00am in St. Ann's Catholic Church located in Nyack, New York. Finally we ask that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made in the memory of Thomas Francis Wynn III to the Joe Raso Hospice Residence at 415 Buena Vista Road, New City, New York, 10956."

2013-10-24T00:00:00Z,"GOODMAN--Walter Flato, A world-renowned breeder-owner-handler of Skye Terriers and an American Kennel Club judge died October 6 in Miami, FL at 91. An enthusiastic traveler who traversed the globe nine times, Goodman was also a patron of the arts and a Life Trustee of Villa Vizcaya. Born to Maurice and Adele Goodman on August 15, 1922 in Rye NY, Goodman followed his father's advice to ""Live up to your name: ""Good-man."" After graduating from Rumsey Hall and the Hotchkiss School, Mr. Goodman attended Yale University ('44). He interrupted his studies in January 1943 to join the United States Army. By the end of WWII, Goodman was second in command of a U.S. P.O.W. camp on the outskirts of Antwerp, Belgium housing 1,700 German soldiers. Following the War, Mr. Goodman completed his bachelor's degree in International Relations at Yale and later earned a Masters in History at Columbia University. Although Goodman worked as a trust officer at the Bank of New York, an associate producer at NBC and at Mike Ellis Productions, his true life's work and passion was in the sport of purebred dogs. His mother Adele founded Glamoor Kennels in 1937 with Walter joining in soon after, and Glamoor Kennels became known as one of the top Skye Terrier kennels in the world, breeding American, Canadian, French and Italian champions. Goodman's dogs earned a record 300 Terrier Group Firsts and 99 Best-in-Shows including Westminster Kennel Club's, where he handled Ch. Glamoor Good News to a Best-in-Show in 1969. After retiring from the show ring in 1975 to become an AKC judge, Goodman judged dog shows worldwide for 36 years, including Best-In-Show at Westminster Kennel Club in 1994. As the Skye Terrier Club of America's delegate, Mr. Goodman was elected to the American Kennel Club Board of Directors in 1988 serving for an unprecedented 24 years to March 2012. Goodman was a long-standing member of Westminster Kennel Club, Westbury Kennel Club, The Kennel Club (UK), Morris & Essex Kennel Club, and Palm Beach Dog Fanciers. He was proudest of having served as President for 28 years at Montgomery County Kennel Club, the club that sponsors the largest, most celebrated all-terrier show in the world in Blue Bell, PA each October. Goodman's innumerable contributions to the world of purebred dogs included his being a founding member of the AKC Museum of the Dog and of the Canine Health Foundation. As a Member of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine Board of Overseers, he co-founded along with Robert A. Flanders the Walter Flato Goodman Center for Comparative Medical Genetics. Goodman's recent honors include the American Kennel Club's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and his induction into the Anne Rogers Clark Hall of Fame at the Show Dogs of the Year Awards in 2013. A resident of Miami, FL since 1973, Walter is survived by his son Robert A. Flanders, five nieces and nephews, three great-nieces, his many close friends, and his beloved Norfolk Terrier, Gypsy.

An enthusiastic traveler who traversed the globe nine times, Goodman was also a patron of the arts and a Life Trustee of Villa Vizcaya. Born to Maurice and Adele Goodman on August 15, 1922 in Rye NY, Goodman followed his father's advice to ""Live up to your name: ""Good-man."" After graduating from Rumsey Hall and the Hotchkiss School, Mr. Goodman attended Yale University ('44). He interrupted his studies in January 1943 to join the United States Army. By the end of WWII, Goodman was second in command of a U.S. P.O.W. camp on the outskirts of Antwerp, Belgium housing 1,700 German soldiers. Following the War, Mr. Goodman completed his bachelor's degree in International Relations at Yale and later earned a Masters in History at Columbia University. Although Goodman worked as a trust officer at the Bank of New York, an associate producer at NBC and at Mike Ellis Productions, his true life's work and passion was in the sport of purebred dogs. His mother Adele founded Glamoor Kennels in 1937 with Walter joining in soon after, and Glamoor Kennels became known as one of the top Skye Terrier kennels in the world, breeding American, Canadian, French and Italian champions. Goodman's dogs earned a record 300 Terrier Group Firsts and 99 Best-in-Shows including Westminster Kennel Club's, where he handled Ch. Glamoor Good News to a Best-in-Show in 1969. After retiring from the show ring in 1975 to become an AKC judge, Goodman judged dog shows worldwide for 36 years, including Best-In-Show at Westminster Kennel Club in 1994. As the Skye Terrier Club of America's delegate, Mr. Goodman was elected to the American Kennel Club Board of Directors in 1988 serving for an unprecedented 24 years to March 2012. Goodman was a long-standing member of Westminster Kennel Club, Westbury Kennel Club, The Kennel Club (UK), Morris & Essex Kennel Club, and Palm Beach Dog Fanciers. He was proudest of having served as President for 28 years at Montgomery County Kennel Club, the club that sponsors the largest, most celebrated all-terrier show in the world in Blue Bell, PA each October. Goodman's innumerable contributions to the world of purebred dogs included his being a founding member of the AKC Museum of the Dog and of the Canine Health Foundation. As a Member of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine Board of Overseers, he co-founded along with Robert A. Flanders the Walter Flato Goodman Center for Comparative Medical Genetics. Goodman's recent honors include the American Kennel Club's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and his induction into the Anne Rogers Clark Hall of Fame at the Show Dogs of the Year Awards in 2013.

A move to New York City earned a position at The St. Regis Hotel, in the development offices of Starwood Corporation, Director of Human Resources at The Palace and lastly, The Westin Hotel. She excelled in her work and won the respect and admiration of colleagues at all levels wherever she worked.

Peled, and her niece, Alma, all of Georgetown; her aunts and uncle, John and Elinor Butler of Potomac, MD, Ruth M. Power of Bedford and Janice Power of Norwood; numerous cousins and a host of friends.

Although she lived in Manhattan for over twenty years, she proudly drove her car with a New York license plate wrapped in a Boston Red Sox plate frame and just last week attended a playoff game at Fenway to see her much loved Red Sox win one last time; she loved her MG convertible; her time in Harwichport and Nantucket.

To insure the financial health of the hospital, he orchestrated the sale of Newark Beth Israel to St. Barnabas Healthcare Systems. The Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey was created with the assets derived from this sale. The Foundation has awarded over $100 million in grants since its inception, focusing its efforts on improving access to quality healthcare for the vulnerable populations in greater Newark, NJ and the Jewish community of MetroWest NJ. As a tribute to Lester Lieberman's commitment to humanism in medicine, the Foundation honors employees, students, and faculty in healthcare who demonstrate extraordinary compassion and kindness in their treatment of patients and families with the Lester Z.

Lester Lieberman was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. He graduated from Weequahic High School and received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology/NJIT). Money was scarce in his family and he worked several jobs to make his way through college, including janitor and shoe salesman. In 1960, Mr. Lieberman founded Atmos Engineering, designing air conditioning and heating systems for commercial properties. He subsequently sold Atmos Engineering to Clarkson Industries, a multinational engineering firm owned by the British conglomerate BTR, Inc. Mr. Lieberman became a director of BTR and President and CEO of Clarkson Industries, based in New York City and responsible for engineering work in 65 countries. Mr. Lieberman was also a founder of Dowel Realty, a real estate company located in Morristown, NJ, that built, owned and operated commercial properties in New Jersey.

2013-11-05T00:00:00Z,"KLEIN--Walter Charles. Born May 11, 1918 in New York City, died October 28, 2013 in New York City. A towering figure, both in stature and in personality, Walter led a very happy and accomplished life. Born to successful Austrian immigrants, he attended Horace Mann School, then attended a secondary school in Vienna (where he learned German for the first time), before returning to the United States to graduate from Harvard in three years. He married the former Mary Kennard Eddy (1921-92) of St. Louis, whom he met while he was at Harvard and she was at Wellesley. Walter was devoted to Mary and they had a 50-year partnership, including the raising of three children: Walter Charles Klein, Jr. (1943-2009); John Eddy Klein; and Margaret Kennedy Klein. Walter first worked for Swift & Company in Chicago and Buenos Aires and then, in 1947, joined Bunge Corporation in New York City, the North American arm of what is now Bunge, Ltd. Over the next 43 years, he transformed a small commodity business into a powerful integrated agribusiness operation in North America, with grain elevators, oilseed and grain processing plants, and river barges focused along the Mississippi River and tributaries south of St. Louis. He also was the force behind Bunge's international expansion in Asia, including Japan and China. Walter was a builder, and his entrepreneurial approach and risk-taking, his involvement in the business, and his dynamic personality were all important to his success. He was a long-time resident of Maplewood and then Short Hills, NJ, where he was a member of the Orange Lawn Tennis Club, Short Hills Club and Baltusrol Golf Club. In New York City, he was an enthusiastic member of the Knickerbocker Club. Walter was an entertaining story teller; a loyal Harvard alumnus and Wellesley supporter; an inveterate collector of artworks and early US stamps; an extensive traveler for business and pleasure; and a gifted linguist, speaking German, French and Spanish and studying Italian up until his death. Among many other gifts, Walter endowed a Harvard professorship and Harvard student scholarships and provided funding for a wing of Harvard's Barker Center for the Humanities, each bearing his name. He was also actively involved with the Fogg Museum at Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Public Library. After his first wife Mary died, Walter married the former Virgilia Heimsath Pancoast, with whom he had become friends in New York. They were happily married for 20 years, took many wonderful trips together, and shared a love of art. Walter enjoyed Virgie's children and grandchildren as well as his own. After Walter had a stroke, Virgie devoted her full attention to his well-being. Walter is survived by his wife Virgie Klein of New York City; his son John Klein of Washington DC; his daughter Margaret Klein of New York City; Virgie's son John Pancoast of New Haven, CT; Virgie's daughters Star Eonnet of Paris, France and Stacy Clark of Dallas, Texas; three grandchildren Jennifer Klein Seaman, Thomas Klein and Laurie Klein Shanahan; and Virgie's five grandchildren Robin and Claire Pancoast, Estelle and Eloise Eonnet, and Dylan Clark. A memorial service will be held at 3pm on Monday, December 2 at St. James Episcopal Church, 865 Madison Avenue at 71st Street. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts should be directed to Central Park Conservancy or Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan New Jersey."

During the week, I boil the florets in two inches of water, drain and add butter and salt.

The Palm Beach Country Club expresses its profound sorrow at the passing of its esteemed member and past President, Michael Stein, and extends sincere sympathy to his children, grandchildren and other members of his family. William L. Mack, President Alan Curtis, Secretary"
2013-11-08T00:00:00Z,"STEIN--Michael. Michael Stein was born in 1925 in New York City, graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy 1942 and from Harvard College 1946, married Louise Rosenberg in 1948 and, thus, began one of the most idyllic marriages ever known that lasted 64 years until Louise passed away on May 24, 2013. For Mike, life without Louise lost most of its meaning. In 1948, Mike joined the Bali company, a family business started by his mother and father, Sara and Sam Stein, became president in 1955, and later took the company public after considerably expanding its manufacturing base and international sales. Under Mike, Bali became the unquestioned leader in its industry. Even so, Mike delighted in telling audiences the ""Sara and Sam"" story, how they started the business with $39 on the front porch of a little bungalow on a dirt street in Brooklyn. Apart from business, Mike devoted himself with considerable passion to the fields of healthcare, public service and foreign policy, focusing on Israel and the Middle East. His first job as head of a philanthropic agency came when he was only 36 years old and was selected to become the founding president of the Gustave Hartman YM-YMHA. Eventually he became a Vice President of the Associated Y's of greater New York, the parent agency. In healthcare, Mike became the youngest trustee upon joining the board of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1963. There he rose quickly through the ranks, chairing major committees, and became the first Vice Chairman of the Medical Center. Mike was also a founding trustee of the Community Health Program of Queens and Nassau and served on the board of the Children's Medical Fund of New York. This led to the creation of its Children's Hospital. Mike chaired the committee that planned the Children's Hospital and helped oversee the process that led it to become one of the finest medical facilities for children in the country. After becoming a Florida resident in 1978, Mike became a founding trustee of the Morse Geriatric Center in West Palm Beach and of the Kramer Senior Resource Center. He was appointed a Medical Care Commissioner of the Town of Palm Beach and served in that capacity throughout the term of the commission. He continued working on health care for his community by chairing the Health Care Committee of the Palm Beach Civic Association where he also served on its executive committee. Mike's other communal activities in Florida included secretary-treasurer of the Palm Beach Police Foundation, president of the Palm Beach Country Club and chairman of the Palm Beach board of the Florida Philharmonic orchestra. Mike was perhaps best known in his community for his work on behalf of Israel and the United States/Israel relationship. The founding of the state of Israel in 1948 had great meaning for him. He was a leader in philanthropic fundraising for Israel both in his community and his industry. Mike became a national officer of AIPAC in 1973 after organizing support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war. He served in that capacity until 1985 when he and his dear friend and colleague, Barbie Weinberg, founded the Washington Institute for Near East policy. The Institute is an educational foundation dedicated to helping foreign service officers and others engaged in foreign policy to better understand the facts and realities of the Middle East and the importance of the US - Israel relationship in achieving American interests in that region. He served the Institute as its president for eight years, then chairman, and finally Chairman emeritus. Mike's interest in Israel also led him to become involved with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he served on its Board of Regents and was awarded an honorary Fellowship in 2008. The singular quality that drove Mike Stein was ""passion"" for a cause he deemed worthwhile. Now he has taken his passion with him in search of Louise, where they will lie side by side under a headstone that says ""together forever"". Mike said many times that he has had a long and very good life, the best possible 64 year marriage to Louise and no regrets except to leave his many works of passion, his colleagues whose friendships he cherished, and his wonderful family that demonstrated the ultimate in love and caring, especially during the final days of his and Louise's lives. He is survived by his children, Linda and Martin Waldman, and Robert Stein; his grandchildren, Jason Waldman, Jackie and Steve Berlowski, Alea Stein, Sylvie Stein and his great-grandchildren, Madison Waldman and Tyler Berlowski to whom he bequeaths a world full of wonders and his blessings for a good life in which they might occasionally think of mamaLouise and papaMike and the very special love they all shared.

2013-11-09T00:00:00Z,"STEIN--Michael. Michael Stein was born in 1925 in New York City, graduated from Valley Forge Military Academy 1942 and from Harvard College 1946, married Louise Rosenberg in 1948 and, thus, began one of the most idyllic marriages ever known that lasted 64 years until Louise passed away on May 24, 2013. For Mike, life without Louise lost most of its meaning. In 1948, Mike joined the Bali company, a family business started by his mother and father, Sara and Sam Stein, became president in 1955, and later took the company public after considerably expanding its manufacturing base and international sales. Under Mike, Bali became the unquestioned leader in its industry. Even so, Mike delighted in telling audiences the ""Sara and Sam"" story, how they started the business with $39 on the front porch of a little bungalow on a dirt street in Brooklyn. Apart from business, Mike devoted himself with considerable passion to the fields of healthcare, public service and foreign policy, focusing on Israel and the Middle East. His first job as head of a philanthropic agency came when he was only 36 years old and was selected to become the founding president of the Gustave Hartman YM-YMHA. Eventually he became a Vice President of the Associated Y's of greater New York, the parent agency. In healthcare, Mike became the youngest trustee upon joining the board of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1963. There he rose quickly through the ranks, chairing major committees, and became the first Vice Chairman of the Medical Center. Mike was also a founding trustee of the Community Health Program of Queens and Nassau and served on the board of the Children's Medical Fund of New York. This led to the creation of its Children's Hospital. Mike chaired the committee that planned the Children's Hospital and helped oversee the process that led it to become one of the finest medical facilities for children in the country. After becoming a Florida resident in 1978, Mike became a founding trustee of the Morse Geriatric Center in West Palm Beach and of the Kramer Senior Resource Center. He was appointed a Medical Care Commissioner of the Town of Palm Beach and served in that capacity throughout the term of the commission. He continued working on health care for his community by chairing the Health Care Committee of the Palm Beach Civic Association where he also served on its executive committee. Mike's other communal activities in Florida included secretary-treasurer of the Palm Beach Police Foundation, president of the Palm Beach Country Club and chairman of the Palm Beach board of the Florida Philharmonic orchestra. Mike was perhaps best known in his community for his work on behalf of Israel and the United States/Israel relationship. The founding of the state of Israel in 1948 had great meaning for him. He was a leader in philanthropic fundraising for Israel both in his community and his industry. Mike became a national officer of AIPAC in 1973 after organizing support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war. He served in that capacity until 1985 when he and his dear friend and colleague, Barbie Weinberg, founded the Washington Institute for Near East policy. The Institute is an educational foundation dedicated to helping foreign service officers and others engaged in foreign policy to better understand the facts and realities of the Middle East and the importance of the US - Israel relationship in achieving American interests in that region. He served the Institute as its president for eight years, then chairman, and finally Chairman emeritus. Mike's interest in Israel also led him to become involved with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he served on its Board of Regents and was awarded an honorary Fellowship in 2008. The singular quality that drove Mike Stein was ""passion"" for a cause he deemed worthwhile. Now he has taken his passion with him in search of Louise, where they will lie side by side under a headstone that says ""together forever"". Mike said many times that he has had a long and very good life, the best possible 64 year marriage to Louise and no regrets except to leave his many works of passion, his colleagues whose friendships he cherished, and his wonderful family that demonstrated the ultimate in love and caring, especially during the final days of his and Louise's lives. He is survived by his children, Linda and Martin Waldman, and Robert Stein; his grandchildren, Jason Waldman, Jackie and Steve Berlowski, Alea Stein, Sylvie Stein and his great-grandchildren, Madison Waldman and Tyler Berlowski to whom he bequeaths a world full of wonders and his blessings for a good life in which they might occasionally think of mamaLouise and papaMike and the very special love they all shared.
