Griffin, Princeton Class of 1955. Jim was elected president of The Ivy Club in 1982, and he led the Club for over three decades, overseeing changes including the admission of women and the establishment of the Foundation to further the Club's educational role. He conceived of and led the effort to build a splendid addition to Ivy's Clubhouse, named by the Board the Griffin Wing despite the reluctance born of Jim's characteristic modesty. He nurtured the undergraduate members in the Club's culture by his unassuming example in word and deed, and by his endearing sense of humor. Thanks to his irresistible charm and wisdom, Jim exercised his leadership through the creation of a willing consensus in the board and the membership as a whole. His vision advanced the quality of the Club's life and enhanced its educational mission. Jim's legacy, in spirit and in stone, will always be an important part of Ivy. Jim Griffin was a natural and complete gentleman, a loyal Princetonian and a man utterly devoted to his family and his friends. The values by which he lived, and the standards he set, inspired all those whose lives he touched. We shall miss him greatly. The Trustees of the Foundation join the Governors of Ivy in extending to Jim's wife, Barbie, and to his entire family, our heartfelt condolences. The Ivy Club Corbin R. Miller, Treasurer Robert A.

After prolonged complications with bone cancer, she passed away peacefully in her Santa Barbara home on May 1, 2015 with her beloved husband and three children present. Wendy grew up with her four siblings in Bernardsville, New Jersey. She attended Ethel Walkers boarding school (Class of '77) in Simsbury, Connecticut and subsequently Boston College (Class of '82) where she received a Bachelor of Arts in History. Later on, Wendy received a Master of Arts degree in Counseling from Pacifica Graduate Institute (Class of '04) in Carpinteria as well as a Health Coaching and Integrative Therapies certificate from the University of Minnesota (Class of '13). In 2007, Wendy founded Healers West with the mission to create a unified global network of healers and to provide an educational community resource for expanding public awareness of complementary and alternative therapies as related to integrative medicine. During her years at Boston College, Wendy met Titus Brenninkmeijer whom she married in 1986 and together they raised three children - Ian (25), Sophie (24) and Miles (21). Wendy lived in a number of countries with her family including Spain, Germany and Brazil. Wendy will be remembered by her closest family and friends as a person who lived to serve others. Following college, Wendy worked with refugees from El Salvador and Vietnam while serving as an in home trainer for the Refugee Women's Program in San Francisco. She also worked with North African and Romani refugees in Spain, rural development and family planning programs in Mexico and volunteered among the street children of Sao Paulo's infamous favelas in Brazil. It was while Wendy was living in Brazil that her husband's near death experience transformed her life, eventually leading to her training as a Flower Essence Practitioner/Reiki Master. She was a member of the Brazilian flower essence organization Gotas de Flor com Amor and prepared flower essences from her home for family and friends. Wendy cultivated a unique understanding and outlook on her medical situation and treatment. To her, personal healing was not defined by the outcome yet characterized as a spiritual journey and an opportunity to learn not only about herself but also the healing powers of alternative health practices with integrated medicine. A memorial service will be held on June 20th at 1:30pm in the Chapel at Ethel Walker School, 230 Bushy Hill Rd. Simsbury, CT 06070.

2015-06-14T00:00:00Z,"ROSENBERG--Professor Sheri P.,passed away on May 22, 2015 at her home in Philadelphia at the age of 48. Sheri was a loving mother to Markus, Maurice, and Margaux, and a wonderful wife to Gregg Kanter. She was devoted to her extended family, particularly her late sister Margot Pulitzer's children whom she loved and cared for as if they were her own. She treated others as if they were family, and many count her as a close friend. Sheri was committed to strengthening Jewish institutions in Philadelphia. She supported Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel by founding Bonim, a weekly program for young children, and serving on its Rabbi Search Committee. She initiated programs to improve the Perelman Jewish Day School, and served on the Board of HIAS Pennsylvania. Sheri was the founder and Director of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law's Human Rights and Atrocity Prevention Clinic. The Clinic won landmark victories, including persuading the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights that the Bosnian Constitution violated the European Convention of Human Rights by excluding ethnic minorities from Bosnia's Presidency. The Clinic partnered with the U.N. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide to assess early warning signs of genocide, and worked with the International Criminal Court's Trust for Victims to develop a field manual for identifying victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Sheri also founded and developed the Clinic's Refugee Representation Project for asylum seekers. Sheri was the Faculty Director of the Cardozo Law Institute in Holocaust and Human Rights, a leading global center dedicated to strengthening laws, norms, and institutions to prevent mass atrocities, and she co-founded its predecessor, Cardozo's Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights Program. As an Associate Clinical Professor at Cardozo, Sheri taught international human rights law and inspired students to pursue careers in genocide prevention. Sheri lectured worldwide. She served on the Board of the Auschwitz Institute for Peace and Reconciliation and regularly presented at its Raphael Lemkin Seminar for Genocide Prevention in Oswiecim, Poland. Sheri was a Consultant to the U.N. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and authored the genocide prevention chapter in the U.N. training manual. She produced an award-winning documentary, Nuremberg: Reflection and Resonance, which traced Nuremberg's influence on modern international tribunals. Sheri published extensively and is co- editor of the forthcoming book Reconstructing Atrocity Prevention. Cardozo presented Sheri with the Telford Taylor Award and the Inspire Award; Yeshiva University presented her with the Point of Light Award; The Center for Peacebuilding (CIM) named her a 2015 Peace Ambassador; and the Anne Frank Center USA announced that Sheri would receive its Outstanding Educator Award. Before joining the Faculty at Cardozo, Sheri worked in Sarajevo as the Panel-Registrar and Judicial Law Clerk for the Human Rights Chamber of Bosnia & Herzegovina. In every area of her life, when Sheri noticed an injustice or a person or institution in need of help, she acted and achieved results, without drawing attention to herself. She was generous, warm, talented and, above all, humble. She lived her dreams by doing the work she loved. By combining brilliance and intellectual honesty with a tenacious work ethic, Sheri made the world a better place and inspired international human rights students and colleagues. She has a place among the righteous. Sheri's devotion to family, Jewish institutions, and combating ethnicity-based injustice was influenced by her parents, Ann Pappenheim Rosenberg and the late Marcus Rosenberg. They cherished extended families and built the Dallas Jewish community by founding Congregation Shaare Tefilla and Akiba Academy of Dallas, the city's first Orthodox day school. Their childhood experiences during the Holocaust -- Ann escaped from Vienna in November 1939, and Marcus lived under Nazi occupation in Bardejov, Czechoslovakia, before being sent to Auschwitz -- motivated Sheri to become a leading scholar of international human rights and genocide prevention. Those wishing to honor Sheri's memory can support the institutions that were important to her: the Cardozo Law Institute in Holocaust and Human Rights, Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel, and Perelman Jewish Day School. 1/3"

He grew up on the Princeton University campus where his father was General Secretary of the Alumni Association. He was a graduate of the Gilman School of Baltimore, MD and earned an AB in history from Princeton University in 1955. After serving as Captain in the US Army, he began a 25 year career at First National City Bank where he rose to be a Vice President and Head of Personnel for Citibank's International Division.

Skaters of all ages joined with him to play fast and furious shinny hockey on the Griffin's pond.

Adrienne, the daughter of the late Mac and Sally Newman, was born in the Bronx on August 22, 1941. She grew up on Burnside Ave and graduated from Evander Child High School. In 1968 she moved to West 235th Street where she raised her three children Shari, Jolie and Erik. Adrienne will be dearly missed by her children and their spouses, Shari (Anne), Jolie (Murray), and Erik (Gabriella); grandchildren, Olivia, Ethan, Sabrina, Max, Sophie, Drew and Ella; her brother Robert (Debbie), and sister- in-law Roberta; as well as her numerous nieces and nephews. Adrienne's roots and heart remained in the Bronx as she worked for many years as the admissions and medical billing coordinator at the Jewish Home and Hospital on Kingsbridge Rd. While there, she was a true advocate for the residents, volunteering her time and energy beyond her work schedule, even adopting the Home's service dog ""Magic"" when he was retired from working on the Alzheimer's unit. She also routinely visited her mother-in-law Dorothy Siegel 3-5 times every week. After retirement, she continued to contribute to the fabric of her community by working part time at Riverdale Sports Physical Therapy. She eventually retired full time. She joined a knitting group and participated in the Friends and Family organization of the Jewish Home and Hospital. But most of her focus and energy was toward her seven grandchildren and their families. Adrienne loved showering them with gifts, hosting holiday dinners and sharing in all the accomplishments and activities of all those in her life. Adrienne was a great friend and neighbor to all those around her. Kind in her heart and generous in her ways. Donations in her memory can be made to Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, or to the Red Dog Fund. 1/3"

He lived frugally in a house in the woods near Spring Lake, NY. Through diligent self-study he became an expert mycologist, naturalist, photographer, and amateur astronomer. He was the most intellectually gifted man I have ever known and had the most acute scientific intelligence. Though reclusive, he had a great capacity for friendship. He did not have a college degree, having dropped out after a year to work as a court reporter for the First Army on Governor's Island. Neither of us, growing up in Astoria in the 1950s, had any money, yet he took ten exquisite photographs in Central Park of the woman I was engaged to marry, had them enlarged to 8x10 size, and sent them to me in Iowa where I was in graduate school. In 1959 he lent me $300, an enormous sum, to buy a suit to get married in. After he died, my daughter gave me a framed picture of him. I cannot look at it. Sidney Landau 1/3"

2015-06-19T00:00:00Z,"BLOCH--Judith, LCSW, pioneer and activist in the fields of special education and early childhood education, died on Monday, June 15, 2015. Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Preschooler's Workshop, later called the Variety Child Learning Center, from 1966 to 2008. She grew the institution from a single classroom to a full service agency providing special education, evaluation, early intervention, therapeutic services, recreational and enrichment programs to thousands of children with developmental disabilities and their families. An early advocate of early intervention, Bloch began working with three-year-old developmentally disabled children when such services were all but nonexistent. In the 1960's mothers were often blamed for their children's autism. By contrast, Bloch viewed mothers as part of the solution and enlisted their aid as part of her curriculum. She later elaborated this philosophy into the Home/School Collaborative Model. To help children, she became a teacher of teachers, a writer, filmmaker, innovator in early assessment, and tireless public advocate. Her many awards include the Thirteen/WNET NY & WLIW21's Community Hall of Fame, and the National Association of Social Workers NY Chapter Lifetime Achievement Award. She is survived by her husband, Dr. Milton Bloch; by daughters Deena Bloch Schaffert (and Stephan Cohen), Natalie Bloch Langner (and David Langner), and Susan Bloch Leach (and John Leach); by brother David Simon (and Suzanne Cohn Simon) and sister Miriam Forman (and John Koller); and by seven grandchildren, Emily, Nathan, Rebecca, Hannah, Sophia, Geoffrey and Levi. 1/3"

When Sam finds that someone has “sucked out the jamminess” of his doughnut — and really, what could be worse? — he puts ketchup inside to trap the culprit. Luckily the perpetrators are two “jampires,” batlike creatures more cute than scary. Even luckier, they fly him to a land of cake castles, tart flowers and an ice cream moon. With rounded shapes, soft colors and pops of jam-bright red, O’Connell’s art works delightfully with McIn­tyre’s supple rhymes to spread a silly, sweetly escapist mood."

As a child Sol was so drawn to music that although told to stay in the car when his father went to run an errand, he was compelled to follow the strains of gospel music spilling from a church. When found by police who asked why he ran away, young Sol said ""I thought I heard angels, and wanted to see them!"" His father said, ""We have music at home."" He responded ""Not like that!"" Sol received a BA in philosophy from William and Mary College and remained a life-long learner, reading biographies weekly. His father Irving died young. Sol and his brother Ivan needed to take over the family dry cleaning business in New Jersey. Their main goal was to provide for their mother Rose and younger sister Florence. They later expanded into real estate in New York and New Jersey. Sol lived with his partner, Ron Kane in New York and spent summers in the Hamptons. Every autumn they went to Paris. Sol and Ron were committed philanthropists whose donations live on at the Met, Gracie Mansion and the White House. They hosted classical concerts in their homes, and walked their German Shepherds in Central Park. Sol loved spending time with his nieces and nephews; he taught them to drive, took them to concerts and shared his passion for the arts and history. Sol had a massive stroke in 1982, but with tenacity and courage managed to recover and live a full life. As his condition worsened, he made Palm Desert his winter home, spending time with friends and family there. His superb caregivers Ray Lopez and Jason Marbella kept Sol healthy and strong for many years.

She was 92. Ms. Hicks, educated at Hunter College and an early Urban League member, worked for some time as an executive at the notable Harold L. Oram public relations firm, among the major fundraisers for the humanitarian and environmental causes of the time. Her notes to and from Mr. Oram with her ideas for innovative fundraising campaigns have been preserved among the Oram Papers in the Indiana University- Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) library. She went on to raise funds for the United Negro College Fund, especially Meharry Medical College. She was directly responsible, thereby, for giving many minority students the opportunity to get a college education. Before her retirement, she also raised funds for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Another of her outstanding accomplishments was helping an interested group form a fundraising LDF branch in Princeton, NJ. Ms. Hicks was born in Harrison, rural Georgia, on October 27, 1922 to the late Thomas Hicks and Lillie Hicks. Her family joined the South-to-North migration of those people of color who had the boldness and the means to avoid the cruelty of segregationist Jim Crow laws and so she grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens, and was educated there. She was a tireless supporter of the formal arts and would never fail to remind friends and associates with similar interests to meet her at performances on Broadway, or at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), St. Thomas (Episcopalian) Church, or the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and at exhibitions in favorite art galleries. She eventually succumbed to the usual circulatory problems of aging, but kept her ready sense of humor and her charming concern for the well-being of her friends and relatives as she struggled with failing health. She is survived by her cousin Viola Lena Doswell of Babylon, NY, and by the people she mentored, as well as by her close friends and her longtime caregivers. Kevin Rudisel, M.D. and Terry Carter 1/3"

2015-06-25T00:00:00Z,"LENNON--Jacques E. 92, died of pneumonia, on June 22, 2015. Born in Luxembourg on January 15, 1923, he began a career in business--spanning more than 70 years--at S.A. des Minerais. In 1939 he emigrated to the U.S. and joined Continental Ore Corporation (COC), the North American office of Minerais, making it possible for him to bring his parents and sisters out of harm's way during the war. He served with distinction in the U.S. Army in the Psychological Warfare Branch in North Africa, Italy, and Austria. Following his military service, he rejoined COC in 1946, becoming executive vice president in 1962. COC became one of the most highly respected international marketing companies of industrial raw materials, with over 30 offices and subsidiaries throughout the world. COC was acquired by International Minerals & Chemicals (IMC) in 1968. IMC (now Mosaic), the world's leading independent producer of fertilizers, acquired COC in order to broaden its international presence and diversify into some of COC's areas of expertise. In 1974, together with his two partners, Louis Lipton and Eric Lomnitz, he started Continental Resources Inc. (CRI), serving as president until the present day. Jacques is survived by his loving and devoted wife, Donatella, who took remarkable care of him during his last years; his cherished daughter, Linda, son-in-law Stuart Baskin, granddaughter Rebecca, and nephews Robert and Mark Wolff, and their families. His self-taught appreciation for art resulted in the eclectic collections in his homes in New York and Rome. His generous philanthropic endeavors characterize his diverse interests and humanistic approach to life. He never forgot his Luxembourg roots, serving as chairman of the Luxembourg America Chamber of Commerce for many years, as well as Luxembourg's Honorary Consul, in New York. Jacques was the family patriarch, never too busy to make himself available. His joie de vivre, irrepressible smile, and twinkling blue eyes can never be matched. He made it great for us all. A Memorial Service celebrating Jacques' life will be held at a later time. 1/3"

After getting her MSW from the University of Pittsburgh she spent the bulk of her career at JCC Association of North America, where she became an institution. Bessie, widowed at age 43, combined her career and brought up her young children at the same time. In 1990 she was awarded the Professional of the Year from the Association of Jewish Center Professionals where she said ""the vow I made to myself was to treat people the way I would like to be treated. Maintaining my integrity and credibility has been my ongoing effort and most important accomplishment on the job."" The Jewish communal workers in 1993 ran out of awards for Bessie, so they gave her a new one - Tikkun Olam. Our loss, unimaginable, unbelievable, and incredibly painful is heaven's gain where Bessie Pine is already treating people with warmth, generosity, objectivity, compassion, sensitivity and menschlichkeit - and she's just getting started. ""Too short time, not enough time, never enough time."" Funeral services will be held on Sunday, June 28 at 11:30am at Sherman's Flatbush Memorial Chapel, 1283 Coney Island Avenue, Brooklyn. 1/3"

Once married and with the support of her children, she went on to provide that same comfort and security to hundreds of rescued animals. Laura lived a life full of compassion and empathy for the suffering. She will be remembered as a devoted wife who unselfishly cared for her husband of 52- years, the late Captain Peter Kelman, as he battled with Lou Gehrig's disease (died 2005); as a loving and infinitely patient mother who raised six educated children who always pushed the boundaries; as a kind, gentle and loving grandmother to Laura, Eric, Lucie, Zach, Grace and Peter and step-grandmother to Jordan and Kristen.

He was born on New Years Eve 1928 in Charlottesville, VA. He was the first of five children born to Philip E Benton MD. and Orient (Nichols) Benton. Philip went to primary school in Wilton CT. and high school in Westport and Bridgeport, CT. When he was thirteen, during WWII, his mother sent him to boarding school at Tabor Academy, an all 'boys' prep school in Marion, MA. He had not been doing well at Bridgeport High school and tended to get into ""trouble as boys do"" so his mother saw to it that he went to boarding school. To this day it is clear that Philip appreciates his mother's foresight in sending him to Tabor Academy. With no money left in the family to pay for his college expenses, determined as he was to succeed, Philip joined the Marine Corps which paid for four years of his college tuition. He achieved the rank of corporal and was honorably discharged. He then entered Dartmouth College where he married Bernice Brennan and had his two oldest daughters. They had two more children together. Bernice died in 1975. Philip later married Mary Ann Ward and he adopted her two daughters. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa Magna Cum Laude. He went on to earn a Masters Degree from The Amos Tuck School of Business. Additionally, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Northwood University in Midland, MI. In 1953 he was hired by the Ford Motor Company as a cost analyst. From there he steadily rose through the ranks until he became the President and COO. He eventually retired in 1992 after nearly 40 years with the company. Philip's love of the water in general and his love of Cape Cod were never far from his heart. While enjoying retirement he could usually be found on or near the water. And you would usually find him with his two closest cousins Pat Patterson and Nick Nichols. Philip was a kind and generous man who touched many lives and is loved by many. He has become associated with the Cape Cod Healthcare Foundation which made great strides in promoting the excellence of Cape Cod Hospital. Additionally, he was involved with the Orleans Conservation Trust which purchases land to be preserved ad infinitum. Philip was preceded in death by his parents, mother Orient (Nichols) Benton and his father Philip E. Benton MD. His sister Carroll Cameron and his brothers Christopher West Benton and Thomas Hart Benton. Philip is survived by His best friend and soul mate, his wife, Mary Ann (Ward) Benton, his sister Ann Benton and his six children: Katharine Harris (David), Deborah Benton, Deborah Ward (Ben Marett), Cynthia Benton, Philip E.

Also ever present were Suzy's doting nieces, Keira and Deirdre Chassman, Deirdre's children Max and Jack Chassman-Silberman, and her grandchildren Savannah and Whittier Vaughan-Wasser. Suzy was the best grandma ever and will be buried with the necklace given her this year: ""Just knowing you're my grandma makes me smile.""

Devoted husband of the late Carol Schrier Gelles, loving father of Robert and Richard (Susan), nurturing grandfather of Andrew, Danny, Kevin and Thomas, loyal brother of the late Henry (Carol), Edith (Michael) and David (Pam), loving brother-in-law of the late Suzanne Schrier Heimerdinger and John (Marilyn) Heimerdinger, and caring uncle of 12 nephews and nieces. Walter treasured his wife, children and grandchildren. He was not just Carol's husband but also her best friend. During a magical 62 year marriage, he and Carol forged a wonderful partnership that deepened as the years went by. Walter celebrated all of his sons' accomplishments and was always available to provide them with advice and comfort. He got tremendous joy from the time that he spent with his grandchildren. Each grandchild was very precious to him. Walter also valued the friendships that he developed with other people across the many decades of his life. He was always a good and sympathetic listener to his friends, and he took the time to get to know each of them. He had a long and successful career as a real estate attorney. He was quite adept at analyzing legal issues, and he was a persuasive advocate for his clients. He was also a delightful colleague to the other members of his law firm. Walter had a keen interest in politics. He always kept himself well-informed by reading newspapers, magazines and books, and by watching political programs on TV, and he never tired of discussing politics with family and friends. He also enjoyed reading books on history. The history of Israel interested him in particular. Through the many books that he acquired on the subject, he mastered all of the details of the creation of Israel as well as its history since being founded. He got much pleasure from playing bridge, almost always with Carol as his partner. Walter loved classical music. Starting as a teenager, he began to purchase recordings of various symphonies and concertos, and he also developed an interest in opera. Among his favorite composers were Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Verdi. Walter was an avid golfer and a loyal fan of the New York Jets football team. He also did a lot of traveling. There were two extensive summer trips to the western U.S. and Canada with Carol and the two boys, and many later trips with Carol to Europe. Walter and his family also spent a number of summer and winter vacations in Lake Placid in the Adirondacks. Lake Placid was where Walter had grown up and where he had met Carol. Those of us who knew Walter will miss him very much. He was a very special man. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday, July 9 at 3pm at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 West Broad Street, Mount Vernon. 1/3"

2015-07-08T00:00:00Z,"LOOP--Floyd D.,M.D. Floyd D. Loop M.D. Former CEO and chairman of Cleveland Clinic, passed away June 11. Dr. Loop served as chairman and CEO of Cleveland Clinic from 1989 to 2004. He was a pioneering cardiac surgeon and former chairman of the Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. Under his leadership, Cleveland Clinic became an integrated regional healthcare delivery system, with an expanded main campus, hospital and clinic in Florida, and its own medical school program. He launched construction of what would become the Sydell and Arnold Miller Family Pavilion and Glickman Tower, and established a sound foundation for Cleveland Clinic's growth in the current century. ""The legacy of Dr. Loop is all around us,"" says Toby Cosgrove, MD, current president and CEO of Cleveland Clinic. ""We can never forget all he's done to make Cleveland Clinic one of the world's great medical centers."" Known to friends and colleagues as ""Fred"", Dr. Loop was the son of a country doctor from Lafayette, Indiana. He graduated from Purdue University, Indiana, and earned his medical degree at The George Washington University, Washington, D.C. After post-graduate training at The George Washington University, the US Air Force at Andrews Air Force Base, and Cleveland Clinic, he joined Cleveland Clinic as a cardiac surgeon in 1970. He performed more than 12,000 cardiac surgeries, and was the author of 350 papers on all aspects of cardiovascular surgery. He refined arterial grafting, improved reoperative techniques, and confirmed the superiority of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery. He led comprehensive follow-up studies of bypass patients, and helped establish the world's first computerized registry of cardiac surgery outcome. In 1975, he was named chairman of the Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular surgery. Over the next 14 years, he consolidated Cleveland Clinic's worldwide reputation for excellence in cardiac surgery, and assembled a team of expert surgeons who would go on to lead their specialty and set the pace for years to come. Dr. Loop was named CEO in 1989. His challenges included declining reimbursement, potential competition from private hospital systems, and the need to preserve Cleveland Clinic's specialty focus amid a growing demand for primary services. He stabilized finances, centralized authority, and streamlined reporting relationships. His strategy to improve regional access resulted in the construction of family health ambulatory centers across Northeast Ohio, and the acquisition of eight community hospitals through the 1990s. At the same time, he invested heavily in information technology, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive electronic medical records system. With a leadership gift of $100 million from Alfred Lerner and family, he launched a philanthropic campaign that enabled the construction of the Lerner Research Institute, Cole Eye Institute, Taussig Cancer Center, and the Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. He improved access and added new operating rooms through the Maria and Sam Miller Emergency Services building. He reaffirmed commitment to Cleveland Clinic Florida, and built a new integrated medical campus in Weston, Florida. Programs and facilities founded under his leadership include the Sherwin Research Building, Children's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic Innovations, the Surgery Center, Neurological Imaging Center, Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, and the purchase and renovation of Foundation House. In 2001, Dr. Loop announced plans for the current Miller Family Pavilion to consolidate heart and vascular services at a single location. With modifications and the addition of the Glickman Tower, the new facility was completed under the administration of Dr. Cosgrove in 2008. Dr. Loop was married to Bernadine Healy, MD, (1944-2011), who served as chairman of the Research Institute from 1985 to 1995. His awards and honors include the American Heart Association Citation for International Service, the American College of Cardiology Cummings Humanitarian Award, and Cleveland Clinic Lerner Humanitarian Award. Dr. Loop retired as CEO in 2004. He continued to advise and mentor and served on private and public corporate boards. His book, ""Leadership and Medicine"" was published in 2009. 1/3"

2015-07-08T00:00:00Z,"MARCUS--James S. Jim's passing is an irremediable loss for all of us who love Pianofest and its purpose of educating gifted young musicians. This is summer, when the music of nature flourishes. Jim's mother was a pianist and he often mentioned hearing her practice ""Rustle of Spring"" by Christian Sinding, a Norwegian composer. Thus, despite my sadness, I would like my comments about Jim to reflect the ongoing joys of the music he provided for us all. Jim is a classic example of a successful person. He had a wonderful career, he was financially successful, and he invested his considerable intellectual and material resources for the betterment of humanity. He focused on supporting music and musicians to help to ensure that they achieved their greatest potential and then presented their art for the enjoyment and inspiration of their audiences. Jim did what all truly great people do, in that he gained greatly and then gave even more, and in this way, gained in his giving. He often advised me on Pianofest matters, and it pleased me to see how the students enjoyed talking with Ellen and Jim and how they became very close to many Pianofest artists. His passing is a great loss and our condolences are with Ellen and all who knew and loved him. Paul Schenly, Director, Pianofest 1/3"
2015-07-08T00:00:00Z,"HARRISON--Helen Herre, died in the early morning of July 4, after fighting a mysterious and undiagnosed illness for five years. Helen was the author of The Premature Baby Book, a guide for parents that went through seventeen printings and was known as ""The Bible"" in neonatal intensive care nurseries. She went on to advocate for parents, insisting that they, rather than doctors, have the right to make life and death decisions in extreme cases. She insisted that doctors give parents a realistic prognosis for survivors of neonatal intensive care. She opposed doctors' tendencies to reassure parents that everything would turn out well, when studies showed the opposite. She was also in the forefront of the movement to ban unanesthetized infant surgery, a common practice until the 1980s, when research showed that it was not only inhumane but harmful to the baby's outcome. Helen was a benign force that changed infant care for the better. She is survived by her beloved children, preemie Edward Harrison and full-term Amy Harrison Sanchez, her son-in-law, Elliot Sanchez, brother Allen Herre of Panama, sister Joan Erwin of North Carolina, and her husband of forty-five years, Alfred Harrison. 1/3"

She went on to advocate for parents, insisting that they, rather than doctors, have the right to make life and death decisions in extreme cases. She insisted that doctors give parents a realistic prognosis for survivors of neonatal intensive care. She opposed doctors' tendencies to reassure parents that everything would turn out well, when studies showed the opposite. She was also in the forefront of the movement to ban unanesthetized infant surgery, a common practice until the 1980s, when research showed that it was not only inhumane but harmful to the baby's outcome. Helen was a benign force that changed infant care for the better.

He was a successful businessman for over 50 years running both his construction company, Bergen County Iron Works, and his real estate development firm, Kessel Associates. Buildings he built can be prominently seen all over northern New Jersey. He was a two-term president of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks; as well as president of the health club at the YM/YWHA in Hackensack. He served on the Board of Directors of Midlantic Bank, and was a trustee of Englewood Hospital. His greatest business achievement was being elected Developer of the Year by the NAIOP. George was extremely philanthropic giving to charities, too many to count. He founded the George Kessel Charitable Foundation over 40 years ago, which continues to give generously to many worthy causes. Funeral services will take place on Sunday July 12, 2015 at 1:15pm at the Sanctuary of Abraham and Sarah, 735 Forest Avenue, Paramus, NJ 07647.

Pardee, holding her hands and with her daughter-in-law, Sally Morris, at her bedside. She was a strong, caring, intelligent, passionate, courageous, hard-working, elegant, and accomplished woman. She was loving and generous to those around her and protective of those in her family circle. She cared deeply about people and wanted the people around her to succeed and be happy in life and to live joyfully in the moment while also preparing carefully for the future. She impressed on all who would listen the importance of family, education, hard work, and active, intellectual involvement in the world around us. She was quieter about discussing her faith, but shared it most with the people closest to her in hopes of guiding them to know the nearness of God. For her, all of these topics were very much intertwined. She was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to her adopted country with her marriage to Scott Pardee on January 29, 1966. They had two children, Alan, who survives her, and Cynthia Lynn Pardee. She was devoted to them and to her family. She was an international economist and worked for a number of years at Bankers Trust (long since merged into Deutsche Bank) and at Marine Midland Bank (which in the end of her time there was acquired by what was then still called Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corp, now known as HSBC). She represented her firms on four continents over her time working in the field. She became a citizen of the United States. She was a strong-willed woman and a survivor by nature, having lived through a war in her native country, deaths of family members, and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, diagonally across the street from where she and her husband lived. It is with sadness that her family reports that she did not survive her quiet battle with cancer. She is survived by a loving family here in New York, throughout the US, and in Santo Domingo who miss her and will cherish her memory. 1/3"

Her three surviving daughters; Ana Maria, Greta and Magda; and her grandchildren, Michael, Ivan and Chantal: were by her side as she took her last breaths. For the past thirty years Maria Luisa resided in Jackson Heights, Queens. She was born in Juan Montalvo, Los Rios, Ecuador and subsequently took residence in Guayaquil. Maria Luisa was the family trail-blazer for the Viteri's: she moved first by herself, to NYC approximately in 1975, for a better life opportunity for her family. She was followed to NYC by her beloved late husband Hugo Federico; her then four daughters including her beloved late daughter, Bella, and her grandson Michael. Maria Luisa's first line-of- work in NYC was within the garment industry. Whenever anyone would visit with her, they would talk and laugh for hours. They never wanted to leave! She was not a complainer; she influenced her four daughters who all made something of themselves, in this challenging world of ours. She was practical, family and education minded and a proud practicing Roman Catholic! She had a gift to make anyone laugh no matter how difficult the circumstances. She was also a fantastic cook, and mediator, (family squabbles). Maria Luisa had an unmistakable inviting smile and picked up Ivan and Chantal (during their formative years) from St. Joan of Arc on Wednesdays (1/2 days) for memorable lunches.

“One” can mean any number of numbers, as in one bunch of bananas (five) or one box of crayons (eight) — and, in this nimble counting book, one clan of any size. Gómez’s adorable digital illustrations of friendly, bobble-headed people in moments of homey togetherness include multiracial families and two men holding hands. It’s a clever way to show the variety between and within families, and Shannon concludes with an apt reminder: We’re all part of “one earth. One world. One family.”"

Pardee, holding her hands and with her daughter-in-law, Sally Morris, at her bedside. She was a strong, caring, intelligent, passionate, courageous, hard-working, elegant, and accomplished woman. She was loving and generous to those around her and protective of those in her family circle. She cared deeply about people and wanted the people around her to succeed and be happy in life and to live joyfully in the moment while also preparing carefully for the future. She impressed on all who would listen the importance of family, education, hard work, and active, intellectual involvement in the world around us. She was quieter about discussing her faith, but shared it most with the people closest to her in hopes of guiding them to know the nearness of God. For her, all of these topics were very much intertwined. She was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to her adopted country with her marriage to Scott Pardee on January 29, 1966. They had two children, Alan, who survives her, and Cynthia Lynn Pardee. She was devoted to them and to her family. She was an international economist and worked for a number of years at Bankers Trust (long since merged into Deutsche Bank) and at Marine Midland Bank (which in the end of her time there was acquired by what was then still called Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corp, now known as HSBC). She represented her firms on four continents over her time working in the field. She became a citizen of the United States. She was a strong-willed woman and a survivor by nature, having lived through a war in her native country, deaths of family members, and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, diagonally across the street from where she and her husband lived. It is with sadness that her family reports that she did not survive her quiet battle with cancer.

2015-07-13T00:00:00Z,"VASSILAROS--John A.,July 10, 2015. With grace and in peace, our beautiful and admired Johnny passed this evening in the soulful glowing love of his family at their home in Bridgehampton, NY. Born in Manhattan on July 26, 1945 to Anthony John Vassilaros and Irene Vassilaros, John was a devoted son, brother, adventurer, sailor, and pilot. He delighted in being a deeply loving father; a tender and absolutely wonderful husband; and an extraordinary, one-of-a-kind friend of friends. As a young man, Johnny served in the Green Beret Special Forces. Since 1964, he was President of Vassilaros & Sons, a third generation family coffee-roasting business that is still thriving today. John was an innately keen businessman who was dedicated to producing a consistently excellent cup of NYC coffee. His wife, Alexandra Frangos Gersten Vassilaros, was blessed to be his fourth cousin on her mother's side, and with their family they share an undying passion for the Greek Island of Ikaria, where their respective families were born and where they enjoyed a small home on the Aegean. Ikaria was their simple paradise, and a foundational part of their bond and continuity. Johnny's motto was ""Live hard, work hard, play hard, and love hard""--all of which he modeled with gusto, verve, and integrity. For those of us who knew and loved him he was a shining presence. He loved life purely, and that spirit radiated from him so powerfully that one couldn't help but be touched by it. In Greek we might describe him as: ""hrisos anthropos""--a selfless person who instinctively puts his loved ones ahead of himself. Vassilaros Coffee actively supports Greek charities, and John served as longtime board member of inner-city youth mentoring program, The 52nd Street Project. He leaves behind a legacy of exquisite love to his wife, Alexandra, and his three adored and big-hearted boys, Tonio John, Luka John, and Stefano John, each of whom adored him to the fullest for his love, generosity of spirit, sense of adventure, and joy. He is also survived by his mother, Irene; his sisters, Sophia, Ann, Irene, and Maria; his nephews and nieces, Stephanie Kasselakis Kyles, John Kasselakis, Zachary Vassilaros, Arianna Peterson, Paul Peterson, Anthony Boyer; and so many beloved cousins and best friends whom he held in his capable heart. A visitation will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel at 1:30pm and 6:30pm on Tuesday, July 14. A service will be held at Cathedral of Holy Trinity (East 74th Street) on Wednesday, July 15 at 11:00am. A memorial of Johnny's extraordinarily well-lived life will be forthcoming.

The funeral service will be held at Palms West Funeral Home, Royal Palm Beach, FL on Wednesday, July 15, 2015 at 10:00am with Stephen H. Pinsky, D.D., Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Beth Torah, Wellington, FL officiating. Interment will follow at The Eternal Light Memorial Gardens in Boynton Beach, FL. The Palms West Funeral Home is handling the services. Eleanor was born in New York City to Celia and Martin Brown on March 18, 1927. She graduated from the Highland Manner School, West Long Branch, NJ in 1943 and from the Russell Sage College, Troy, NY in 1947. She married Eugene Goldberg, who she had met at sleep-a-way camp when she was 14 years old, on June 28, 1947 in the Penthouse Ball Room of the Pierre Hotel, NYC and where they have resided for the past 25 years. Eleanor and Eugene's love and respect for each other evolved into a partnership that enabled them to build an extraordinary life for themselves and their family. Their support of each other, throughout the over 70 years that they were together, enabled them to individually and jointly achieve their goals and experience life to its fullest. Eugene and his brother Robert took a small domestic distributor of chinaware, flatware, and glassware to hotel and restaurant chains and built it into a differentiated multinational firm that serviced leading companies in the foodservice, restaurant, airline and hospitality industries, with Eleanor as a key partner in the endeavor. Later, Eleanor became a trustee of her alma mater, Russell Sage College of Troy, NY. Eleanor was known for her keen mind, sharp wit, beauty and elegant sense of style. She was a very active presence on the New York and Palm Beach social scenes. She and her husband were generous supporters of many causes, including the Central Park Conservancy, the Society of the Four Arts, Palm Beach Symphony, the Frick Museum, the Royal Academy, the United Jewish Federation and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, among countless others. She was also a devoted long-time member of Sands Point Golf Club, Congregation Emanu-El and the Harmonie Club of New York. Her other passions were traveling, wine, golf, the arts, and her family. She traveled extensively with her husband, golfing in Scotland, shopping in Paris, exploring new vistas in Asia and Africa, seeing all that the world had to offer, completing over thirty trips around the globe. When not traveling, she loved Central Park and spent many hours sitting with her husband on one of the benches she had donated in commemoration of her family, admiring the park's beauty and majesty. Eleanor is preceded in death by her husband, Eugene, her daughter Lauren Kessler, her sisters Joan Roberts and Barbara Brown, her brother-in- law, Robert Goldberg, her nephew James Roberts and her parents Celia and Martin Brown. Eleanor is survived by her daughter Celia Zahringer of Wellington, FL, her nephew Curtis Roberts of Tuxedo Park, NY and Berwyn, PA, her step brother Stephen Brown of NYC, her sister-in-law Joan Goldberg of Delray Beach, FL, her grandchildren James Kessler, M.D. of Great Neck, NY, Major Peter Marks, USMC of 29 Palms, CA, George Zahringer IV, Killian Zahringer and Lauren Zahringer of NYC, her great-grandchildren Benjamin Marks and Jackson Marks of Brandon, VT and her nephews Barry Goldberg of NYC, Ira Goldberg of Newport Beach, CA, James Goldberg of Lake Worth, FL and her niece Ellen Goldberg of Easthampton, NY. 1/3"

A long-time veteran in the home furnishings industry, Herb worked for almost 50 years for just three firms, Grosby Products, Tilbury Fabrics and Richloom Fabrics; and was known to everyone in the trade as a straight shooter. Herb was the original home-body who loved to fix whatever needed fixing and whose idea of heaven was an hour examining the Craftsman tools at Sears. If you look hard, you will see him now with a half-gallon of Breyers, the game on and the dog at least half-way in his lap. 1/3"

Sandra is remembered as a loving mother, adoring grandmother, inspiring mother-in-law, devoted sweetheart and loyal friend.

Responsible for a number of cases that fundamentally impacted the field of employment law from its inception, including the landmark case of Thoreson v. Penthouse Magazine & Robert Guccione, which held that a claim of sexual harassment can be established based on the victim's testimony alone. He was the lead trial lawyer in the case of McIntyre v. Manhattan Ford, Lincoln Mercury, a sexual harassment, retaliation and intentional infliction of emotional distress suit, where a Manhattan jury awarded the plaintiff $6.6 million, which was then one of the highest awards for sexual harassment in the entire nation.

Cohen, which confirmed the constitutionality of the NYC Human Rights Law, which has led to countless victims of discrimination finding protection under that statute. He was known as a tireless advocate and a wonderful mentor, whose contribution to the law will be remembered by the many people whose lives he touched. Born in Manhattan, raised in the Bronx and a veteran of WW2, in which he fought heroically in the South Pacific, he is survived by his beloved wife Paula, son Joshua, daughter Davida, and six grandchildren.

Sandi is survived by her three sons - or as she always referred to them her ""best friends"" - Mitchell, Steven and Kenneth; her grandchildren Ian, Carly, Samuel, Briella, Eliana, Gabriel, Harrison and Daniel; her daughters-in-law Lori, Charlene and Kim; her beau Mike; her dear SweetPea and so many lifelong friends, all of whom will feel her loss for many years to come. She is preceded in death by her beloved husband Morton. For those close to Sandi, a bright light has faded from the landscape. The memories of such a special woman will echo in the minds and hearts of all who loved her. The next time a funny risque story is shared or a shockingly honest statement is made, a smile will appear on the faces of the people that were fortunate enough to know Sandi as they find themselves lost in reverie. The funeral service is scheduled for 10am on Thursday, July 16 at Riverside Memorial Chapel at 180 West 76th Street in New York. 1/3"

Proud grandfather of Alex, George, Eliza, James, Adrienne, William, Max, Jake, and Lily. He is also survived by his sister, Celina, and her husband, Marvin Zborowski. Mark Sternlicht was born in Krakow, Poland on December 9, 1929, the son of the late Jacob and Lola. He spent the years of World War II in hiding and fighting with the partisans in and around the mountains of the Czech Republic. He was 9 years old when the war broke out and 15 years old when it ended. He traveled from Poland, to the hills of Czechoslovakia, to Hungary, where he was adopted by a Hungarian priest, and back to Czech where he was liberated. As his father, Jacob, was captured by the Russians and sent to a labor camp, Mark became the de facto head of the family during the war years, living in caves and bartering for food and other life necessities. More than a year after the war, Mark was miraculously reunited with his father whom he presumed had passed. Mark went on to complete his education earning an electrical engineering degree from the University of Brussels. Mark, his parents, sister and grandmother immigrated to the United States in 1951 and settled in the Bronx. In 1956, he met the love of his life, Harriet Guiterman, at a wedding in February. They married in August of 1956, first moving to Jackson Heights and then settling in Jericho, Long Island where Mark worked as an engineer for Bechtel. He then moved his young family to Stamford, CT in 1968 and after several careers, founded the United States division of Wonder Corporation serving as its U.S. CEO. The company's success earned him many awards, a seat on the Connecticut Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau and trips to China with Connecticut's then governor, Grasso. In his later years, he worked with the T.V.A. and at age 67, took the Series 7 exam and was offered a position at Smith Barney in Greenwich, where he joined his wife and spent another 10 years. Mark served as President of Congregation Agudath Sholom in his hometown, Stamford, on the Board of Bi-Cultural Day School, and on the Regional Board of the American Jewish Committee. Mark spoke more than eight languages. He loved the United States, its democracy, freedoms and ""can do"" anything attitude. He loved classical music, every car ever made, the opera, travel, his synagogue, his many friends and most of all, he loved his wife, his children, their families and especially his nine grandchildren with all his heart. Mark had a passion for all life had to offer and never took it for granted. He served as a mentor, consigliere, role model, fighter and a study in great character and resiliency to all who were blessed to know him. The family invites friends to the memorial service at Congregation Agudath Sholom, 301 Strawberry Hill Avenue in Stamford, CT on Thursday, July 16th at 10:00 am.

Known as Rosie, she was born in New York City on July 1, 1923, the oldest daughter of William Barclay Parsons, Jr. M.D., and Rose Peabody Parsons. Her grandparents were Endicott Peabody, founder of the Groton School, and his wife Fanny Peabody, and William Barclay Parsons, founder of an engineering firm that later became Parsons Brinkerhoff and chief engineer of the first subway in New York City and the Cape Cod Canal, and his wife Anna Reed Parsons.

At the time of her death, she was an Honorary Council member of the Women's Prison Association, on whose Board she served for 45 years from 1969-2014 and as President from 1976 to 1979. Later in life, she was equally devoted to Staying Put, serving as an enthusiastic volunteer for this wonderful organization based in New Canaan, which is dedicated to serving the needs of the community's senior citizens helping them to enjoy safer, healthier and more independent lives in their own homes. In everything she did, Rosie brought both a strong hand and an even stronger sense of humor, for which all who knew her will remember as her most endearing quality. She will be deeply missed by her children, Rose Peabody Lynch of Greenwich, CT and New York City, R. Vincent Lynch, Jr. of New York City and his wife Cynthia, and Alexander Parsons Lynch of Greenwich, CT and his wife Sally, as well as her eight grandchildren and six, soon-to-be seven, great grandchildren.

Marlene was best known as a trailblazing female journalist whose early success as a television correspondent - she was the first woman to anchor a prime time network newscast - helped pave the way for others who would come after her and change the face of television news forever.

A three- time Emmy Award winning correspondent, producer, writer, and former news executive, Marlene's illustrious career in journalism spanned more than three decades, including stints at ABC News, CBS News, and PBS. In addition to reporting assignments, she produced and narrated documentaries for HBO, public television, and others. When her journalism career was over Marlene remained active as an advocate for women in the news profession. She also contributed to the development of young journalists as adjunct professor at the NYU Journalism Institute. Marlene will be remembered as a warm, engaging, and undaunted individual who accomplished so much in her groundbreaking career and was incredibly generous with her time and resources.

2015-07-17T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Beverly Sher, died at home Monday two years after a diagnosis of late-stage ovarian cancer. She was 85. The last two years were her life in microcosm - fiercely independent; thrilled (and at times disappointed) by theater and travel; closely following the news, usually on her beloved iPad; sustained by old friends; still engaged and challenged by legal work. Above all, was her devotion to family - Stuart, her husband of nearly 60 years; her sons, Adam, Harlan and Noam; her daughter-in-law, Aviva Michaelov; and Nuli and Kika, her granddaughters. Even as illness weakened her body, her personality, drive and deep intelligence never flagged. Beverly was born Aug. 29, 1929, in Buffalo, and raised in the Bronx by her father, Julius, a dentist, and mother, Alta, a lawyer who worked for Zionist organizations. Her older sister, Harriett Shapiro, who taught college biology and was a civic leader in Amherst, Mass., died in 2005. Beverly graduated Christopher Columbus High School at 16 and earned a scholarship to Cornell. At NYU Law School, where she met Stuart, her life took shape. In 1976, Beverly was elected Civil Court judge. In nearly 25 years on the bench, much served as a State Supreme Court justice, she championed the rights of New Yorkers, from tenants facing wrongful eviction to homeless people returning bottles for deposits who were turned away by supermarkets. We will forever cherish her memory. Family and friends will gather from 1pm to 5pm Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the home of Stuart Cohen. 1/3"

2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,"MACE--Jeffrey Howard. The family, friends and colleagues of Jeffrey Mace deeply mourn his loss on July 16, 2015. Valued by his many law partners and clients alike as an extraordinarily wise and trusted advisor, Jeff was a partner in the New York Office and a member of the Executive Committee of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, where he headed the Lloyd's of London practice. The consummate lawyer, he served as principal counsel to Lloyd's in the U.S. for more than 25 years, and was personally singled out for recognition by then Chairman of Lloyd's Sir David Rowland for shepherding the venerable insurance market through Reconstruction & Renewal in the 1990s. He also represented Lloyd's in high level negotiations with the United States Treasury and matters before other state and federal regulators. Born in Brooklyn in 1956, Jeff graduated from the University of Arizona and Hofstra Law School and began his career as a CPA. He progressed to tax partner at the former LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae, and ultimately advised many of the leading insurers and reinsurers in the world on their most sensitive and significant tax, regulatory and corporate matters. More important to Jeff than his many triumphs for his clients was his beloved and loving family. He is survived by his devoted wife of 23 years, Rhonda Click Mace, whom he adored, and the children who were his pride and joy: Matthew Lawrence Mace and Leah Meredith Mace; his mother Beatrice Mace Weinberg; his sisters and brothers Barbara Mace Geller (Howard), Scott Mace (Carolyn), Bruce Weinberg (Geri), Mindy Weinberg Becker (Barry) and Richie Weinberg (Marilyn); and his loving nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his father, Donald Mace (d. 1968) and stepfather Morris Weinberg (d. 2009). Jeff played a leadership role in raising awareness and funding for scleroderma, serving as the President of the Board of Directors of The Scleroderma Foundation and a Board member of The Scleroderma Research Foundation, and he lobbied Congress to pass the Scleroderma Research and Awareness Act. In everything he did, including the simplest acts of his daily life, Jeff inspired and led by shining example, with the utmost integrity, grace, compassion, courage, humility and his towering intellect.

2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,"LYNCH--Rose Peabody Parsons, aged 92 and beloved mother, grandmother and great grandmother, died at her home in New Canaan, Connecticut this past Saturday, July 11 after a brief illness. Known as Rosie, she was born in New York City on July 1, 1923, the oldest daughter of William Barclay Parsons, Jr. M.D., and Rose Peabody Parsons. Her grandparents were Endicott Peabody, founder of the Groton School, and his wife Fanny Peabody, and William Barclay Parsons, founder of an engineering firm that later became Parsons Brinkerhoff and chief engineer of the first subway in New York City and the Cape Cod Canal, and his wife Anna Reed Parsons. Rosie was passionate about her extended family, the Groton School and, most of all, her grandchildren and great grandchildren. At the time of her death, she was an Honorary Council member of the Women's Prison Association, on whose Board she served for 45 years from 1969-2014 and as President from 1976 to 1979. Later in life, she was equally devoted to Staying Put, serving as an enthusiastic volunteer for this wonderful organization based in New Canaan, which is dedicated to serving the needs of the community's senior citizens helping them to enjoy safer, healthier and more independent lives in their own homes. In everything she did, Rosie brought both a strong hand and an even stronger sense of humor, for which all who knew her will remember as her most endearing quality. She will be deeply missed by her children, Rose Peabody Lynch of Greenwich, CT and New York City, R. Vincent Lynch, Jr. of New York City and his wife Cynthia, and Alexander Parsons Lynch of Greenwich, CT and his wife Sally, as well as her eight grandchildren and six, soon-to-be seven, great grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations would be gratefully received by Staying Put, 58 Pine Street, New Canaan, CT 06840. A memorial service will be held in her honor in New Canaan in September. 1/3"
2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,"MACE--Jeffrey Howard. The family, friends and colleagues of Jeffrey Mace deeply mourn his loss on July 16, 2015. Valued by his many law partners and clients alike as an extraordinarily wise and trusted advisor, Jeff was a partner in the New York Office and a member of the Executive Committee of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, where he headed the Lloyd's of London practice. The consummate lawyer, he served as principal counsel to Lloyd's in the U.S. for more than 25 years, and was personally singled out for recognition by then Chairman of Lloyd's Sir David Rowland for shepherding the venerable insurance market through Reconstruction & Renewal in the 1990s. He also represented Lloyd's in high level negotiations with the United States Treasury and matters before other state and federal regulators. Born in Brooklyn in 1956, Jeff graduated from the University of Arizona and Hofstra Law School and began his career as a CPA. He progressed to tax partner at the former LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae, and ultimately advised many of the leading insurers and reinsurers in the world on their most sensitive and significant tax, regulatory and corporate matters. More important to Jeff than his many triumphs for his clients was his beloved and loving family. He is survived by his devoted wife of 23 years, Rhonda Click Mace, whom he adored, and the children who were his pride and joy: Matthew Lawrence Mace and Leah Meredith Mace; his mother Beatrice Mace Weinberg; his sisters and brothers Barbara Mace Geller (Howard), Scott Mace (Carolyn), Bruce Weinberg (Geri), Mindy Weinberg Becker (Barry) and Richie Weinberg (Marilyn); and his loving nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his father, Donald Mace (d. 1968) and stepfather Morris Weinberg (d. 2009). Jeff played a leadership role in raising awareness and funding for scleroderma, serving as the President of the Board of Directors of The Scleroderma Foundation and a Board member of The Scleroderma Research Foundation, and he lobbied Congress to pass the Scleroderma Research and Awareness Act. In everything he did, including the simplest acts of his daily life, Jeff inspired and led by shining example, with the utmost integrity, grace, compassion, courage, humility and his towering intellect. He was a true hero, greatly respected and much loved. Funeral services will be on Sunday, July 19, at noon at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, in Manhattan.

Donald graduated Williams College (Phi Beta Kappa) and Harvard Law School before serving in the Korean War. For more than 60 years he had a distinguished career practicing law in New York City as the managing partner of Golenbock and Barell, a founding partner of Shack, Siegel, Katz & Flaherty, and a partner of Blank Rome. Donald was an indispensable adviser to his clients, many of whom became life-long friends. Actively involved for years in the New York Civil Liberties Union, Donald was a champion of the underdog. Born and raised in Brooklyn, he was heart-broken when his Dodgers moved west but quickly shifted his ""wait until next year"" brand of fandom to the Mets, who, like the bums before, rarely exceeded his expectations. Donald loved tennis, sailing, and swimming, lively conversation, theater, music, good books, good food, and good Scotch. Yet Donald was most of all devoted to his family. He lost his loving wife of 61 years, Barbara, barely a month ago. Donald was a rock in the lives of his children, David and Laura, a beacon for his grandchildren Nicole, Joseph, and Francesca, to whom he was affectionately known as Papa, and looked forward to providing direction to his great-grand-children, Emma and Olivia. We will miss his penetrating mind, his social conscience, his deep love for his family, and his loyalty to his friends. A memorial service will be held at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10024 on Sunday, July 26, 2015 at 4:00pm.

Marlene was best known as a trailblazing female journalist whose early success as a television correspondent - she was the first woman to anchor a prime time network newscast - helped pave the way for others who would come after her and change the face of television news forever. But she was also a great friend to CSS, having served for more than 20 years as the Chair of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), the organization's signature volunteer program, and as a former member until 2015 of the CSS Board of Trustees. A three- time Emmy Award winning correspondent, producer, writer, and former news executive, Marlene's illustrious career in journalism spanned more than three decades, including stints at ABC News, CBS News, and PBS. In addition to reporting assignments, she produced and narrated documentaries for HBO, public television, and others. When her journalism career was over Marlene remained active as an advocate for women in the news profession. She also contributed to the development of young journalists as adjunct professor at the NYU Journalism Institute. Marlene will be remembered as a warm, engaging, and undaunted individual who accomplished so much in her groundbreaking career and was incredibly generous with her time and resources. It is with sadness and a profound sense of loss that we mourn her death. 1/3"

2015-07-19T00:00:00Z,"MACE--Jeffrey Howard. The family, friends and colleagues of Jeffrey Mace deeply mourn his loss on July 16, 2015. Valued by his many law partners and clients alike as an extraordinarily wise and trusted advisor, Jeff was a partner in the New York Office and a member of the Executive Committee of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, where he headed the Lloyd's of London practice. The consummate lawyer, he served as principal counsel to Lloyd's in the U.S. for more than 25 years, and was personally singled out for recognition by then Chairman of Lloyd's Sir David Rowland for shepherding the venerable insurance market through Reconstruction & Renewal in the 1990s. He also represented Lloyd's in high level negotiations with the United States Treasury and matters before other state and federal regulators. Born in Brooklyn in 1956, Jeff graduated from the University of Arizona and Hofstra Law School and began his career as a CPA. He progressed to tax partner at the former LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae, and ultimately advised many of the leading insurers and reinsurers in the world on their most sensitive and significant tax, regulatory and corporate matters. More important to Jeff than his many triumphs for his clients was his beloved and loving family. He is survived by his devoted wife of 23 years, Rhonda Click Mace, whom he adored, and the children who were his pride and joy: Matthew Lawrence Mace and Leah Meredith Mace; his mother Beatrice Mace Weinberg; his sisters and brothers Barbara Mace Geller (Howard), Scott Mace (Carolyn), Bruce Weinberg (Geri), Mindy Weinberg Becker (Barry) and Richie Weinberg (Marilyn); and his loving nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his father, Donald Mace (d. 1968) and stepfather Morris Weinberg (d. 2009). Jeff played a leadership role in raising awareness and funding for scleroderma, serving as the President of the Board of Directors of The Scleroderma Foundation and a Board member of The Scleroderma Research Foundation, and he lobbied Congress to pass the Scleroderma Research and Awareness Act. In everything he did, including the simplest acts of his daily life, Jeff inspired and led by shining example, with the utmost integrity, grace, compassion, courage, humility and his towering intellect. He was a true hero, greatly respected and much loved. Funeral services will be on Sunday, July 19, at noon at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, in Manhattan. The family encourages donations in Jeff's memory to The Scleroderma Research Foundation and Scleroderma Foundation, Tri-State, Inc. 1/3"

2015-07-19T00:00:00Z,"PHILLIPS--Victor Duzerah, Jr Loving husband of seventy years to Grace (Frysinger), devoted father to Vic, Minta, and Stone, died peacefully July 11th in Greensboro, NC. He is remembered by family and friends for his kindness, generosity, humility and intellect. First and foremost, Victor was a family man, always providing loving care and encouragement. Deflecting attention from himself, he focused on others' pursuits. His introspective shyness and quiet thoughtful nature delighted in Grace's gregarious ways. A classic case of ""opposites attract"" sustained a long marriage. Known for his dry wit and cluttered desk, Victor was once asked by ""neatnik"" Grace why he never learned to ""clean up after his own mess,"" an early lesson taught to her kindergarten students. He replied, ""I never went to kindergarten."" Last year, as Grace's progressive dementia necessitated memory care in separate quarters, Victor visited her three times daily-- his life's purpose. Born on New Year's Day, 1919 to Victor and Annie Phillips, Victor Jr. grew up fourth of six children on a farm near Waxahachie, TX. A child of the Great Depression, he learned early lessons in self- sufficiency, discipline and empathy. Childhood years spent without electricity inspired his lifelong interest in electronics. Early on, Victor built his own crystal radio set, hi-fi stereo, even a television. His gifted mind thrilled at the beauty of calculus and the power of words. He enjoyed classic literature, daily crossword puzzles and e-mailing favorite wordlists to his grandchildren. At 63, he joined the new computer revolution. Well into his 80's, he was the go-to-man for all things cyber for his children and digitally-challenged friends. Following coronary by-pass surgery at age 70, he embraced exercise. He took diurnal walks, undeterred by inclement weather. With increasing age, he switched his daily routine to a NuStep machine, pedaling until the week he died. Victor was also an early champion of psychotherapy, talking openly of its life-enhancing benefits in managing his anxiety, helping to de-stigmatize mental health care for others. An Army Veteran of World War II, Victor sustained a shrapnel injury in the Battle of the Bulge resulting in lifelong paralysis of his right arm. He talked about this significant life change in a 1997 father-son interview on Dateline NBC. In a body cast, he married Grace, June 5th, 1945. Victor attended the University of Texas, Austin, Chemical Engineering, BS, and Chemistry, MA, 1951. He was a Monsanto chemical engineer, 1950-1982. In 1965, the family moved from Texas City, TX to suburban St. Louis, where Victor was a founding member of St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Ellisville, MO. Former rector Howard Park remembers him for his unfailing humor and unwavering gratitude for the gift of divine grace. Rev. Park noted Victor's formulation of a guiding spiritual principle, ""Grace is the solution in which faith can grow."" Victor is survived by his wife, Grace, three children, Victor D. Phillips, III, PhD of Milwaukee, WI (wife Mai), Minta Phillips, MD of Julian, NC and Stone Phillips of New York, NY, Broadcast Journalist (wife Debra), five grandchildren, Anisa Asakawa (husband Nick), Streeter, Catherine, Ben, Chiara, two cousins, five nieces and three nephews. A memorial service will be held at St. Martin's Church, 11am, August 29th, 2015.

My mom started the club's annual Hat Day, a tradition which carries on. My mom was the owner of The Arts Made Lively and spoke on the life and fashion of Coco Chanel. As a deputized San Francisco Commissioner, my mom officiated numerous weddings, including same sex marriages, long before the Supreme Court spoke.

She was 98. She received her Bachelor's degree from Rockford College, and graduated from the University of Chicago as a medical doctor in 1941, one of the first three women to get medical degrees from the university. She entered the Public Health Service, and served during WWII in Washington, DC and Kansas. Later, Dr. Johns was the first woman to graduate with a Masters of Public Health from Harvard. She married Dr. William A. Hall (deceased) and raised five children. The family moved to the west coast where she pursued her career in medicine. She led a life of service and accomplishment, always aspiring to improve public health. Her interest in progressive politics informed her work to help those in need. During her career in California, she worked as a pediatrician at UCLA at the Santa Clara County Health Department with migrant populations providing preventive health and maternal and child healthcare; with the mentally ill at Agnews State Hospital; as a volunteer at the United Farmworkers clinics in Salinas; and with the Flying Samaritans treating Native Americans on remote tribal lands. She retired from her position as Medical Director of the Home Care program at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Santa Clara, CA in 1982, where she also had served as Chief of Staff. Upon retirement she received a commendation from the State of California for her service to the community. After her retirement she enjoyed many years living among the redwoods near Watsonville, CA, and ultimately placed a conservation easement on her beloved property with the Santa Cruz Land Trust for preservation. She loved dogs and flowers, and enjoyed reading, collecting stamps, and music, remembering the songs of her childhood into old age. She spent the last 9 years of her life living with her daughter Marcia along the Umpqua River in Umpqua, OR. We will miss her sense of humor and her amazing memory for songs, poetry recitations, and all other items 'great and small' that she learned in her childhood. She is survived by daughters Diana Hall, (Tim) Mt.

2015-07-21T00:00:00Z,"WALLACE--Joanne C.,unexpectedly passed away, in her sleep, on July 19, 2015 at age 69. Born September 6, 1945 in New York City, Joanne was the only child of Joseph and Sophie Czechlewski. She was raised in Manhattan, and had an intense love for New York City her whole life. After attending Marymount School of New York on 5th Avenue, Marymount College, Tarrytown and Teachers College, Columbia University, Joanne taught music for many years in the New York City public schools. Joanne was loved by all who knew her, because she was smart, talented, witty, fun loving and extraordinary generous to her friends. Joanne loved being with people and people loved to be with her because she took a great interest in life. Joanne was devoted to her Catholic faith, friends and her family, especially her husband William (Bill), with whom she recently celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary. Joanne and Bill were each other's best friend, closest companion and biggest supporter. Rarely apart, they loved spending time with each other and everything they undertook was enhanced by being together. Joanne was a great advocate for her two children, working tirelessly to instill in them the values and morals needed to navigate life, teaching them through example unconditional love. Music was Joanne's passion. Blessed with a powerful mezzo-soprano voice, Joanne studied and sang opera professionally with Musica Reservata in New York, and later sang for many years with The Grace Notes in Greenwich, CT, and other groups, but most fun was when she could be coaxed into singing for family and friends, where she would light up the room. Joanne and Bill regularly attended the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and myriad cultural offerings in New York City, a city she truly loved. Beyond music, Joanne loved her gardens, enjoyed golf and bridge, and was a good sport about her family's love of sailing and being on the water, no matter how bad the weather. Joanne lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, Watermill, New York and Hobe Sound, Florida and was a member of the Colony Club in New York City, The Belle Haven Club in Greenwich, Connecticut and Loblolly in Hobe Sound, Florida. She will be missed desperately by her family and all the people she had contact with throughout her life. And they are certain that Joanne will be singing a heartfelt rendition of Sto lat as she is welcomed into heaven. Joanne is survived by her husband William, her daughter Joan, her son Andrew and her daughter-in-law Wistar. A wake will be held on Tuesday, July 21 and Wednesday, July 22 from 5pm to 8pm in Joanne's home. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held Thursday, July 23 at 10:30am at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola located at 980 Park Avenue in New York City, followed by interment at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx and a reception at the Belle Haven Club in Greenwich, CT.

She was 90 years old. Gloria was born on November 19, 1924 in Bayside, New York. She was married for 46 years to William Ray Pitt III, and they were the most graceful of dance partners until his death in 1992. She was also predeceased by her mother, Katherine Murphy Igoe, her father, Herbert ""Hype"" Igoe, (celebrated illustrator and sports writer for the New York American), her sister Jaunita Coon, her brother Jack Igoe, and her son William Ray Pitt IV. Gloria is survived by her son, David Pitt (Fred Goldstein) of Hollywood, California, her daughter, Janice Pitt Fitzgibbon (Timothy) of McLean, Virginia, and her grandchildren, Colin William Fitzgibbon and Cathryn Gloria Fitzgibbon. Gloria took great pride in her volunteer work at St. Francis Heart Hospital in Roslyn, New York. Over a period of more than 25 years, she logged nearly 13,000 volunteer hours and was fondly referred to as ""The General,"" due in large part to the 26 gold ""Volunteer Award Bars"" she wore pinned to her uniform. Even after her eyesight was diminished by macular degeneration, Gloria adeptly maneuvered the halls of the hospital guided by the different colors of the floor tiles, and she put thousands of patients at ease in the process. As the daughter of a sports writer, Gloria loved language in all of its forms, including political debates, the daily crossword puzzle, conversations with patients, and stories that improved in humor and detail with each retelling. She also loved to dance, which she continued to do regularly until shortly before her death. She never met a stranger, as could be attested by many of the fellow Amtrak passengers she encountered during her regular trips from New York to see her grandchildren before she moved from Port Washington to the Chesterbrook Residences in McLean, Virginia two years ago. There will be a graveside service at 11 a.m. on Friday, July 24, 2015 at Nassau Knolls Cemetery in Port Washington.

2015-07-22T00:00:00Z,"WALLACE--Joanne C.,unexpectedly passed away, in her sleep, on July 19, 2015 at age 69. Born September 6, 1945 in New York City, Joanne was the only child of Joseph and Sophie Czechlewski. She was raised in Manhattan, and had an intense love for New York City her whole life. After attending Marymount School of New York on 5th Avenue, Marymount College, Tarrytown and Teachers College, Columbia University, Joanne taught music for many years in the New York City public schools. Joanne was loved by all who knew her, because she was smart, talented, witty, fun loving and extraordinary generous to her friends. Joanne loved being with people and people loved to be with her because she took a great interest in life. Joanne was devoted to her Catholic faith, friends and her family, especially her husband William (Bill), with whom she recently celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary. Joanne and Bill were each other's best friend, closest companion and biggest supporter. Rarely apart, they loved spending time with each other and everything they undertook was enhanced by being together. Joanne was a great advocate for her two children, working tirelessly to instill in them the values and morals needed to navigate life, teaching them through example unconditional love. Music was Joanne's passion. Blessed with a powerful mezzo-soprano voice, Joanne studied and sang opera professionally with Musica Reservata in New York, and later sang for many years with The Grace Notes in Greenwich, CT, and other groups, but most fun was when she could be coaxed into singing for family and friends, where she would light up the room. Joanne and Bill regularly attended the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and myriad cultural offerings in New York City, a city she truly loved. Beyond music, Joanne loved her gardens, enjoyed golf and bridge, and was a good sport about her family's love of sailing and being on the water, no matter how bad the weather. Joanne lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, Watermill, New York and Hobe Sound, Florida and was a member of the Colony Club in New York City, The Belle Haven Club in Greenwich, Connecticut and Loblolly in Hobe Sound, Florida. She will be missed desperately by her family and all the people she had contact with throughout her life. And they are certain that Joanne will be singing a heartfelt rendition of Sto lat as she is welcomed into heaven. Joanne is survived by her husband William, her daughter Joan, her son Andrew and her daughter-in-law Wistar. A wake will be held on Tuesday, July 21 and Wednesday, July 22 from 5pm to 8pm in Joanne's home. A Mass of Christian Burial will be held Thursday, July 23 at 10:30am at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola located at 980 Park Avenue in New York City, followed by interment at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx and a reception at the Belle Haven Club in Greenwich, CT.

He attended schools in Aitos and Kotel, and Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, Bulgaria, the University of Vienna, and the New School for Social Research in New York. During World War II, he served as a medical corpsman in a Bulgarian Red Cross sanitary train operating across Europe; he was wounded twice and witnessed the firebombing of Dresden. During the war, in Poland, he met the late Helena Marzec. He returned to find her as hostilities were ending and in 1945, in Prague, they married and lived together for 70 years. After the war, he returned to Bulgaria with his wife. An opponent of the communist regime, he was imprisoned periodically and tortured; his family was persecuted; his father was executed in 1955. In 1957, he illegally left Bulgaria with his wife and children, a crime punishable by death. The family lived in a displaced persons camp in Vienna, Austria, and eventually came to the United States. They settled in Yonkers, New York. He worked for Radio Free Europe for many years and, after its New York offices were wound down, for financial institutions in Manhattan. He was a frequent visitor to New Suffolk, New York and Westerly, Rhode Island and, in retirement, to Menton, France and Cambridge, England. He traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Americas. He enjoyed reading, gardening, music, art, nature, swimming and skiing, and was a keen student of the political scene. He played an active role in raising his grandchildren. He was devoted to family and friends. Son of the late Jovi and Paraskeva Tenev, he is survived by a daughter Marie Pepper of Cambridge, England; a son Jovi Tenev and daughter-in- law Nancy Hingston of Princeton Junction, New Jersey; a granddaughter Tara Pepper Goldsmith and her husband Charles Goldsmith of Cambridge, England; a grandson Sean Pepper of New York; a grandson Liam Pepper and his wife Bic Hoang Leu of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; a grandson Nicholas Tenev of Madison, Wisconsin; grandchildren Christopher and Helena Tenev of Princeton Junction; and great grandsons Charles, Thomas, and Jonathan Goldsmith of Cambridge, England.

Carleton, 85, died at home in Larchmont, New York, on July 20, 2015 with his adored wife of 60 years, Mona Dukess, and his beloved daughters, Linda, Laura and Karen Dukess, at his side. The most loveable of men, he was treasured by his six grandchildren: Joanna and Sam Bernstein, Ben and Stephen Schwed, and Joseph and Johnny Liesman, and was a cherished father-in-law to Jody DiPerna, Roger Schwed and Steve Liesman. He loved his nieces and nephews, rejoiced in his friendships with people young and old, and was known as a great raconteur and a wise listener. Carleton was pre-deceased by his older brother, Joseph Dukess. A graduate of Syracuse University and Columbia University School of Law, Carleton had a distinguished career as a real estate attorney and developer. He drafted the documentation for the nation's first condominium development and lectured extensively on the then-novel form of ownership. His interest in the restoration of urban buildings for low and moderate income housing led to his co-founding of Continental Wingate Company, Inc., a housing and rehabilitation company. He was a president of the National Housing and Rehabilitation Association and served on the Citizens Housing & Planning Council of New York. He later was a partner in Castle Properties Co. and a director of Apple Bank for Savings in New York. Appreciative of his good fortune, Carleton devoted significant time and attention to charitable endeavors. He was a trustee of Barnard College, and a member of the boards of the New York Foundation, Community Resource Exchange, Castle Hill Center for the Arts and the Provincetown Art Association and Museum. Carleton loved Italian opera, the music of Benny Goodman, fishing, boating, single-malt Scotch and reading, but loved nothing more than spending time with his friends and family, especially in his favorite place, his home in Truro, Massachusetts. A memorial service will be held at 11am on Friday, July 24 at John J. Fox Funeral Home in Larchmont, New York.

2015-07-22T00:00:00Z,"MILLIMET--Erwin, 89, of New York City and Massachusetts, left us on July 20, 2015. Erwin was born in New York City, the son of Henrietta and Maurice Millimet, a well-known New York City lawyer and brother of Beatrice. He spent his young years on a dairy farm in Fitchville, Connecticut. He served in World War II in combat operations in Europe and the Philippine Islands. He escaped from a German prisoner of war camp to rejoin his regiment. Erwin was a graduate of Amherst College, Phi Beta Kappa, and of Harvard Law School C.L. He was the recipient of post graduate fellowship in political science and foreign relations. He worked with Dr. Karl Lowenstein on the drafting of the new constitution for West Germany. Erwin's prime interests after family were the law, education and national politics. His 40 year legal career was with the national law firm, Stroock and Stroock and Lavan for which he retired as the Chairman of the Executive Committee. He was known as an expert in corporate law, and represented major corporations and financial institutions and charities, with service on the boards of directors and trustees. He acted as special master for federal judges in New York and Massachusetts. On behalf of the National Venture Capital Association he was the co-author of the plan assets regulations of the Department of Labor which were essential for the development of venture capital. On specific assignments he represented the post-revolution government of Haiti and the government of Malaysia. He was a member of the corporate division of the senior lawyers committee of the American Bar Association, an arbitrator with the Arbitration Association and a consultant to the local offices of the district attorney and attorney general. Erwin's love of education led him to invitations for speaking and teaching at several post graduate schools on the east and west coast. He participated in the establishment of a paralegal program at UCLA and Elms College in Chicopee, MA. Erwin was active in national republican politics from the Eisenhower years, the Regan Administration, and the Administrations of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. He was a member of the Presidential Task Force. He was a co-founder of President Reagan's ""Citizens for America"" and Jack Kemp's ""Stand Up America"". He was a member of the United Nations Commission on African Development Strategies, and a member of the African National Support Group. He is survived by his wife Dr. Sharon Christie, his daughters Rachel and Sarah of Springfield, MA, their mother Mary, and his grandson, Lucas, of San Diego, CA. His sons, Robert and James, predeceased him in 2012 and 2010, and their mother, Renee predeceased him in 1988. Erwin was a religious man who believed in close family relationships and the one God of all people, regardless of culture, denomination or background. His departure leaves a large gap for all who loved him. Donations to celebrate Erwin's life may be made of any personal choice to an organization helping needy children receive education. A gathering to celebrate Erwin's life will be held Thursday, July 23rd, beginning at 4:00pm in Forastiere Smith Family Funeral Home, 220 North Main St., East Longmeadow, MA (413) 525-2800.

He grew up in Bayside, Queens along with his brother, Joel Messinger, and attended Bayside High School before earning his bachelor's degree from the University of Bridgeport and his juris doctorate from St. John's University School of Law. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1975. Marty began his remarkable 36-year career with Westinghouse Broadcasting and CBS in 1978.

He played a key role in the merger of CBS and Group W, the merger of CBS with Infinity Broadcasting and numerous other significant transactions. Prior to joining Group W in 1978, Marty practiced corporate law at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.

2015-07-24T00:00:00Z,"MESSINGER--Martin P.,age 66, of New York City and East Hampton, NY, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, July 19, 2015 at his home in East Hampton, New York. Marty was born in the Bronx, New York to Roslyn Cohen and Hyman Messinger. He grew up in Bayside, Queens along with his brother, Joel Messinger, and attended Bayside High School before earning his bachelor's degree from the University of Bridgeport and his juris doctorate from St. John's University School of Law. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1975. Marty began his remarkable 36-year career with Westinghouse Broadcasting and CBS in 1978. Prior to retiring in December 2014, he had served as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel for CBS since 1996; and chief legal officer for the CBS Television Stations group since the division was formed in 2000. Marty also served as CBS Corporation's first Chief Compliance Officer for four years, following the company's separation from Viacom in December 2005. He joined the CBS Law Department in 1996, following the merger of CBS and Westinghouse. Prior to that, he was Vice President and General Counsel of Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W). He played a key role in the merger of CBS and Group W, the merger of CBS with Infinity Broadcasting and numerous other significant transactions. Prior to joining Group W in 1978, Marty practiced corporate law at the Wall Street law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. The counseling and representation CBS's stations received under Marty's leadership was the best in the business. As much as his commitment to professional excellence, Marty was also revered for his deep commitment to being a friend and mentor to those around him and taking a genuine interest in the lives and careers of colleagues throughout the company. Marty's greatest pride and joy was his family. He was a devoted, involved and incredibly proud father to his children Nicole, Christopher and John, and a beaming grandfather to Nicole and her husband Bryn Harder's three daughters, Madelyn, Ruby and Layla. He is also survived by his lifelong friend, and the mother of his three children, Lupe Abuchaibe. Marty was a brilliant, intellectually curious and deeply funny man. His passion for books was evident to anyone who ever entered his home and his love for movies was also well known. He was a lifelong fan of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, the New York Giants, the Rangers and Knicks, and all things sports. Funeral services will be held at 2pm on Saturday, July 25 at Most Holy Trinity Church in East Hampton, NY. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital or Save the Children, two charities that were favorites of Marty. 1/3"

2015-07-24T00:00:00Z,"ROSE--Alan, aged 67, died at home in New York City on July 7 from lung cancer. He was born on April 27, 1948 in Regensberg, Germany to Herbert and Marjorie (Murrell) Rose. Alan's early years were spent living in Germany, Japan, Colorado and Mississippi. The family moved to Baltimore in Alan's teenage years and he became an ardent fan of both the city and its people. After three years at the Maryland Institute of Art Mr. Rose worked as an independent graphic designer for Harry, an underground newspaper and on John Waters' films. For a brief period he lived in San Francisco collaborating on artwork for albums put out by various bands including The Quicksilver Messenger Service. Moving to New York in the early 70's he joined the National Lampoon. Alan Rose earned acclaim with his 1980's World At Your Feet Books, a series of such landmarks as the Empire State Building. He married Anne (Spaulding) Rose in 1981 and moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. During the summers he transformed a simple Adirondack cabin into a magical mountaintop masterpiece, complete with birch bark wallpaper and a tree in the living room. No typical father figure he coached his stepdaughters on junk store shopping, culinary risk-taking as well as dirt bike riding on Cuttyhunk Island. Alan's unconventional, selfgoverning and thrifty nature generated countless adventures for himself and those around him. His ideas were as innovative as his humor was keen. He is survived by his wife, Anne, his brother Michael B. Rose (Jenny) of Plymouth, Massachusetts, his stepdaughters Hilary Diebold of West Springfield, Massachusetts, Anne Diebold (Dan Szenda) of Southwick, Massachusetts and two step-grandchildren. In addition he leaves an aunt, five cousins, three step-nieces, one step- nephew and one great step- nephew. There will be a private service at the Adirondack lake he loved and a memorial service at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made in Alan Rose's name to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and sent to the Office of Development, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Attn: Lauren Kelly, 633 Third Avenue, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10017. 1/3"

2015-07-26T00:00:00Z,"WOLLMAN--Anne Carolyn, died at the age of 82 on June 5, 2015. She was a prominent and discriminating collector of art works including ceramics, prints, and paintings; and was known for her impeccable taste in the clothing and jewelry she wore. The Vermont home that she and her husband designed was filled with works of art and antiques. Some of the ceramics and prints constituted the material for a show called Cross Currents in 20th Century Art, at the Currier Museum in Manchester, New Hampshire, during the summer of 2010. As an enthusiastic supporter of the arts and the artists who created them, she curated a number of ceramic shows on compelling intellectual and artistic themes, such as Vanitas and After Palissy. She served as a trustee of many organizations, including The Clay Studio of Philadelphia; Watershed Center for the Ceramic Arts, Newcastle, Maine; and The Vermont Arts Council. She is remembered by those who knew her for her comprehensive knowledge of the field of art, her unerring eye, and the gently mischievous teasing which was reserved for certain special friends. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College in 1954, and of the Harvard-Radcliffe Graduate Program in Business Administration in 1955. Her three daughters also graduated from Harvard College and are pursuing careers: Julie as President of Edinboro University of Pennsylvania; Emily as a Senior Director of Med Assets, a hospital management and consulting firm; and Diana in tax law as a partner in Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. The older of her two grandchildren, Sara, is starting a career in art therapy; and the younger, Rosa, is currently attending Harvard College. Anne Carolyn Wollman is survived by her husband of 58 years, Harry, who was a former Medical School Dean, and is now a partner in Alexander, Wollman and Stark, where he serves as an advisor to executives and developer of talent for academic medical centers. Memorial services will be held in Woodstock, VT on September 20, and in Philadelphia on October 17.

Born in Webster, New York in 1940, Dick Leone spent the bulk of his career in public service. A graduate of the University of Rochester, he earned a Masters degree and a PhD at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. A pragmatic progressive whose views were forged during the Kennedy era, Leone worked on many local and national campaigns. One of his proudest moments was working as an advance man on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign in Oregon. He also worked on presidential campaigns for George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis and Bill Bradley. In the '60s, he was executive director of the White House Task Force on The Cities. In addition, Leone managed Brendan Byrne's two successful campaigns for Governor of New Jersey, in 1973 and 1977. From 1974 to 1977, Leone was state treasurer of New Jersey.

He was a Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Education at Columbia University, Teachers College where he taught masters and doctoral students in psychology, counseling and education. Dr. Adkins was born in Beirut, Syria (now Lebanon) on October 25, 1932 to Dr. Leslie John Adkins and Mrs. Edith Sanderson who were missionaries serving in Turkey and Syria. He was a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy and of Princeton University, Class of 1955. He received his doctorate in Counseling Psychology from Columbia University, Teachers College in 1963 where he worked on the groundbreaking Career Pattern Study. This was followed by a year at Harvard University at the Center for Personality. He was associated with the US Navy for over twelve years, first as a member of the NROTC at Princeton and then as a Naval Officer on the USS Salem, from 1955 to 1958, the flagship of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. During that time he received training at the Naval Justice School. He became involved with the War on Poverty where he worked with the YMCA of Greater New York in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Project TRY, to develop a large training center for educationally and economically disadvantaged youth. In 1966 he became a founding faculty member of York College, City CUNY where he helped design the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge (SEEK) program, directed at helping low income students achieve college success. His work at Teachers College and at the Institute for Life Coping Skills for over thirty years, reflected his passionate interest in developing new methods for helping people learn the complex attitudes and behaviors they needed to cope with the predictable life tasks of career, marriage, parenting, dealing with family dynamics, confronting loss and other psychological issues. His design of multi-media counseling systems to reach larger numbers of people was a major focus of his work. He trained thousands of graduate students on how to develop psychological, behaviorally based interventions, using his methods and theory, for a variety of populations and problems. Dr. Adkins numerous professional research and writing focused on these issues and he was in the process of writing a book which summarized his theoretical models and ways to apply them in all these areas. The Adkins Life Skills Career Development Program (ALSP) was his most successful and nationally known program. The ALSP was originally published by The Psychological Corporation, a division of Harcourt, Brace, and Jovanovich. The program helped people learn to make short-term and long-term job and career choices, become self-directing and learn to navigate occupational systems. Most importantly it helped people learn about and believe in themselves. The ALSP was used in over 2,000 agencies including prisons, homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers, welfare-to-work programs, economic opportunity centers and community colleges, in 45 states. The Institute trained over 5000 staff members as Life Skills Educators who delivered the program in their own agencies. Over 1 million people graduated from this program. The impact of the program was well documented in numerous academic research studies. There is Spanish and an Italian version of the program. A Life Coping Skills curriculum, based on Dr. Adkin's theory and methods, was instituted in over 200 community colleges in India to help students from small villages learn how to psychologically navigate larger urban life. Over the years, Dr. Adkins served on many non-profit boards of directors, including the YMCA of Greater New York, the HOPE Program for the homeless, the NYS Advisory Group on Adult Education, the Greenwich Adult and Continuing Program and the Center for Insurance Research. He was also a founding board member of Princeton Project '55 Center for Civic Leadership, inspired by Ralph Nader, a classmate, which helped Princeton undergraduates become involved with the work of non-profit and non-governmental organizations nationwide. In recent years, together with his wife Dr. Caroline Manuele Adkins, he continued to direct the Institute for Life Coping Skills, revising its 3rd and international editions. In semi- retirement, Win as he was affectionately known became an enthusiastic member of the Retired Men's Association of Greenwich, CT where he served on the Program Committee and was a Co-Director of the Melody Men, a singing group that entertained in nursing homes throughout the local area. He was predeceased by his parents and his sister Beverly Wells.

Winthrop Adkins was an inspired and passionate teacher. He was concerned always with social and economic justice and with making a real difference in the world. He spent countless hours personally counseling people who were going through crises and transitions in living. He was a ""force of life"" who dignified everyone he met and made them feel special, no matter who they were. He was a loving husband, father, brother and uncle to all his family.

Alan's early years were spent living in Germany, Japan, Colorado and Mississippi. The family moved to Baltimore in Alan's teenage years and he became an ardent fan of both the city and its people. After three years at the Maryland Institute of Art Mr. Rose worked as an independent graphic designer for Harry, an underground newspaper and on John Waters' films. For a brief period he lived in San Francisco collaborating on artwork for albums put out by various bands including The Quicksilver Messenger Service.

He was a trustee of Barnard College, and a member of the boards of the New York Foundation, Community Resource Exchange, Castle Hill Center for the Arts and the Provincetown Art Association and Museum.

A memorial service was held at 11am on Friday, July 24 at John J. Fox Funeral Home in Larchmont, New York. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to Cancer Support Team of Purchase, New York, or the Provincetown Art Association and Museum. 1"

Bernard, beloved husband of Joyce Loewenthal West, adoring father of Jane West and Stacy West Clark, grandfather to Sara Lindsay Clark, Molly Addison Clark and Benjamin Luka Schmitt-West, passed away suddenly on Tuesday, July 28. He was a man of immeasurable generosity who doted on his family and friends with joy, love, birthday cards, gifts, visits and his time. Born in New York City to Lillian West and Milton West, Bernard was a brilliant thinker who adored reading books, watching classic movies from the 1930s and 1940s, skiing, golf and most of all his treasured NYC where he resided for over 50 years. A lover of all things NYC and Colorado and his wonderful house in Westchester, he loved and was a regular at the Ballet, NYC Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera, the NYC theatre scene and events in Beaver Creek CO. He was a member of Quaker Ridge Golf Club, The University Club, The Harmonie Club, The Cornell Club and The Beaver Creek Club. One of his greatest loves was Cornell University from which he obtained his undergraduate (1955) and law degrees (1955) and volunteered for numerous alumni activities over the years. A second love was American History. He was a brainiac about the Civil War and World War II and his second calling was to be a history teacher. He was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was deliriously happy whenever he was in a plane or flying one. Another of his loves was driving and he was darn great at it at 83! He grew up in Rockville Centre, NY and graduated from Cheshire Academy in 1949. In his professional life, he practiced real estate law for a number of years before joining his brother William in running Charles H. Greenthal and Co. -- a leading NYC real estate management firm. Once retired, he volunteered at Lenox Hill Hospital, read to the blind and doted on his wife of 59 years who he adored beyond words and was his absolute soulmate. A life-long Mets fan, he was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, brother, son and friend. He is also survived by his mother Lillian West and adored brother William West, and precious step- grandchildren Anna and JT Schmitt and many loved nieces and nephews. We love you dad and will treasure your memory forever. Family will receive friends at Frank Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue (81st Street) on Thursday, July 30, 6-8pm.
