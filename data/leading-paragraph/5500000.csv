The National Association of Securities Dealers reported yesterday that the number of shares sold short and not yet covered - or ''short interest'' - fell one-half of 1 percent for actively traded over-the-counter securities in its national market system for the four weeks that ended in mid-August. A total of 255.5 million shares were held short and not yet covered in mid-August, the association said, compared with a revised total of 256.9 million in the period that ended in mid-July. The August activity represents short selling in 2,335 stocks; in July the short selling was spread among 2,299 issues.

Under this reasoning, a large jump in the position would also be bearish."

1990-08-26T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: When it comes to antiques, whether they be furniture or textiles, their history bespeaks a world of fashion and a way of life that affected the owners as well as the makers.

WHILE big, flashy science projects get the bulk of public attention, small-scale science and the structure needed to support it have fallen into serious disrepair, prompting cries of alarm from researchers. Despite its name, small-scale basic research is the largest and most important part of the American scientific enterprise.

More so than big science, its discoveries lie at the heart of the scientific adventure, nourishing the nation's intellectual life and economy.

From the writings of Kay Thompson, who immortalized the Plaza and Eloise, its resident little girl, to the pages of Fodor's, thousands of words have been written about the hotels of New York. Affordable is rarely among them. Manhattan has more than 57,000 hotel rooms, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, many crammed into the densely packed blocks between 30th Street and 60th Street. The finest are splendid for a sensational view, an elegant meal or a weekend's escape. But the holiday ends abruptly with the bill. This fall, double rooms at the Carlyle start at $275 a night. The Pierre charges $310 for its smallest double rooms. And at the Plaza a deluxe double room with a Central Park view costs $485. That's without the little extras, like room service, tips, video rentals, minibar charges and, most painfully, city and state taxes. Autumn is arguably New York's most agreeable season, as most Manhattan hotels acknowledge by raising their prices and scaling back discounts until the dark days of midwinter. This year visitors looking for comfort but not luxury should prepare to pay $125 to $210 for a basic double room at a middle-range hotel with a good location.

Mindless of winter's approach and the protocols of dormancy, the dahlia and marigold, the tomato and basil make no provision for frost, which here in northwestern Connecticut might be a month away, or a day. The annuals in September practice none of the inward turning of the hardy perennials, which you can see slowing down, taking no chances, turning their attention from blossom and leaf to root and stashed starch. But instead of battening down the hatches, saving something for another day, the annuals throw themselves at the thinning sun, open-armed and ingenuous. On those early autumn days when frost hangs in the air like a sword of Damocles, evident as sunlight to the lowest creature, is there anything much more poignant than a dahlia's blithe, foolhardy bloom? When the mildest frost, one of those tentative breaths of winter September often brings, could blast it black overnight?"

In that short span Mozart managed to compose such a quantity of music that it takes a book of a thousand pages just to list it adequately (the ''Chronological-Thematic Catalogue'' by Ludwig Kochel, now in its sixth revised edition). And that quantity is of such a quality that the best of it is still our standard of perfection in music, never to be surpassed (since perfection, as a standard, has long since gone out of style). Mozart is the very earliest composer by whom works in practically every genre he cultivated have been maintained in an unbroken public performing tradition to our own time; except for Handel's oratorios, nothing earlier has lasted in this way. Haydn, Mozart's great contemporary, has survived only in part; his operas, for example, have perished irrevocably, as periodic attempts to revive them unfailingly prove.

James Graham Ballard, 59, looks a bit like a vacationing Oxbridge don with his long, thinning hair and a shirt whose open collar gives the impression of just having been released from the grip of a necktie.

His novels are complex, obsessive, frequently poetic and always disquieting chronicles of nature rebelling against humans, of the survival of barbarism in a world of mechanical efficiency, of entropy, anomie, breakdown, ruin. Yet his focus is always on the human - there are no extraterrestrials in his fiction - and the blasted landscapes that his characters inhabit are both external settings and states of mind."

Knowing the distinction has become even more important this season, when men's-wear styles from Armani to Brooks Brothers have featured the soft, slouchy silhouette that looks best with a hat.

1990-09-16T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Since 1980, a tide of films featuring, even starring Gabriel Byrne has washed ashore here. Playing opposite Jill Clayburgh in Costa Gavras's ''Hanna K.,'' he was an Israeli prosecutor with an accent appropriate to the venue; for ''Gothic,'' a Ken Russell surreal frenzy, he was Lord Byron, with bouffant hair and upper-class inflections; his speech emerged slightly and romantically Italianate in ''Julia and Julia,'' a Kathleen Turner vehicle, and a touch Hispanic in ''Siesta,'' an overnight failure redeemed by the presence of Ellen Barkin, whom he subsequently married."

1990-09-27T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: I always thought the division of Germany after 1945 was unnatural. The wartime allies, at Teheran and Yalta, were clearly thinking of Germany as a whole, even while demilitarizing and deindustrializing it to make sure that it could not start another war.
