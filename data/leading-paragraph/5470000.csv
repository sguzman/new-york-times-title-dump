Not ''clumsy'' or ''crude'' or ''dumb'' or ''messy,'' all of which can be compliments, depending on the kind of music and whether there is some passion behind the mess.

There is an undercurrent of unbridled sensuality in the dewily sweet ''Roses,'' which opened the program presented by the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Thursday at City Center. ''Runes'' is a dark, mysterious ritual whose urgency recalls one ancient root of the word that means both ''secret'' and ''cries."

This year, the debate will encompass many things, but a centerpiece will be the proposal by many leading figures in Congress to raise tax rates for the rich, starting with the infamous ''bubble.''

So nothing about ''Tales From the Darkside'' is likely to give anyone much of a scare. But thanks to casting that is savvier than the horror norm, and to direction by John Harrison that is workmanlike and sometimes even witty, at least it's fun. Spite plays an important role here, especially for the mummy in the film's first episode (''Lot 249,'' adapted from a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) who tries out certain embalming techniques on a spoiled, modern-day college boy. Christian Slater and Steve Buscemi play fellow students engaged in a battle of wits, with the mummy as a dangerously lively pawn.
