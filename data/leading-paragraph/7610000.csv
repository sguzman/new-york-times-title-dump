He was born in 1922, the son of Henry and Constance Brady Volk, and spent his early years in West Englewood, NJ. His college education at Cornell was interupted by World War II, when he joined the Navy and from there was appointed to the US Naval Academy. He graduated in 1946. After serving on a destroyer with the Sixth Fleet, he resigned his commission to study law. He graduated from Yale Law School with honors (Order of the Coif) in 1953. Volk joined the law firm Shearman, Sterling and Wright in New York City the year he graduated. In 1954, he married Joyce Geary, whose father was a prominent admiralty lawyer in San Francisco. Through his wife, he met several young maritime attorneys in the city, and envied their stories about their careers in a new and fascinating field to him. In 1956, he joined the firm of Burlingham, Hupper and Kennedy in the city, a firm specializing in the practice of maritime law. He spent the rest of his working life in admiralty law, participating in many of the most notable cases of the era. These included representing the Italian Line in connection with the Andrea Doria-Stockholm collision off Nantucket in July 1956, the Santa Rosa-Valchem collision off New Jersey in January 1957, and the Torrey Canyon grounding off England in 1967. Other cases were the Seawitch-Esso Brussels collison in New York harbor in 1973, and the Salem sinking off the west coast of Africa in 1980, one of the largest maritime fraud cases in history.

He was a life member of the American Bar Association. When he retired from the Burlingham firm in 1992, he and his wife moved to Portsmouth, NH, where he continued his practice of law as counsel to the firm of McLane, Graf, Raulerson & Middleton. One of the most interesting of the matters in which he was involved while there was the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.

But for Paul DelVecchio, the peacockish housemate otherwise known as Pauly D, the party is just getting started. ''THE PAULY D PROJECT,'' a spinoff to have its premiere Thursday at 10:30 p.m. on MTV, follows Mr. DelVecchio as he resurrects, with a little help from some childhood pals, the D.J. career that flagged when he joined the reality show. It's ''Entourage,'' Rhode Island style, with a cast featuring Ryan Labbe, Mr. DelVecchio's best friend and wingman; Gerard Gialanella, known as Big Jerry, his security force; and Michael Morgan (Biggie), his mentor, and the only man with a girlfriend.

He was born May 1, 1919 in Providence, Rhode Island to Harold Robinson and Beatrice Wright Shippee. He is survived by his adoring wife of 45 years, Patricia Morel Shippee. A graduate of Rhode Island State College, Mr. Shippee served in the US Army from 1941 to 1945, and was promoted to major and awarded the Bronze Star for his role in re-opening the port of Port du Bouc in Southern France, following previous landings in Casablanca and Anzio.

Though he had the résumé for a successful career in architecture -- he was an intern for Richard Neutra in the 1950s, and also worked for the architect Henry Hill and the landscape architect Robert Royston -- Mr. Bello chose to become a steward of the land. It happened after meeting the Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi. Mr. Bello asked Mr. Nervi if he thought his ferroconcrete curvilinear forms could be done in wood, and Mr. Nervi said: ''There is no wood in Italy. Go home and do it in California.'' So he did. In 1968, on 400 acres in the redwoods of Northern California, Mr. Bello and his wife, Vanna Rae, began to build what has become a handcrafted compound of structures, bridges, trails and houses. The newest building is the art gallery (right), which showcases Mr. Bello's wood sculptures, including one carved from a massive piece of redwood that was struck by lightning, and has a roof made of lattice and a translucent material that makes the light inside it glow.

2012-03-25T00:00:00Z,"BACK in 2008 the Swedish sister folk duo FIRST AID KIT first made a name for itself by retreating to the woods. In a forest near their home Johanna and Klara Soderberg recorded an intoxicating cover of Fleet Foxes' ''Tiger Mountain Peasant Song'' that became a YouTube hit, getting the attention of the Foxes themselves. A few years later First Aid Kit retreated again, this time to Omaha to work with Mike Mogis. He's a producer, studio owner and musician who was central to the rise of the influential Omaha indie-rock label Saddle Creek Records, home to Bright Eyes, Cursive and more. The Soderbergs met Mr. Mogis on tour -- they played alongside Bright Eyes, which Mr. Mogis had joined -- and he agreed to produce their second full-length album, ''The Lion's Roar'' (Wichita), which was released in January. Vigorous Saddle Creek pastoralism is the mood of the new album. The Soderbergs' vocals sound robust, and the music is more urgent and fuller bodied than the duo's previous work, which was winningly naïve. Now the songs are sturdy; they announce themselves loudly, hiding from nothing. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, websterhall.com; $20."

''But you like doing all that stuff,'' he blurted in his defense. I don't recall how the conversation ended (probably badly), but I thought of it while reading a new study about the more mundane responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 181 heterosexual college professors who had children 2 or younger to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, the pleasure they experienced from child care. On 16 out of 25 child-care tasks -- like changing diapers, taking a child to the doctor or getting up in the middle of a night to attend to a child -- women reported statistically significant higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. Over all, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's."

After graduating, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania Law School where he received his JD before beginning his career as a lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York, where he worked for two years. Transitioning away from law, Bob moved back to Cleveland with McKinsey & Co. in 1980, and in 1984 founded his own firm, Brantley Partners, above the garage of his home on Brantley Road in Shaker Heights. Focusing on venture capital and private equity investments, Bob built a successful portfolio of business over the following 25 years. He served on dozens of corporate boards nationwide, as well as the boards of The Cleveland Playhouse and Hathaway Brown School, and was a member of the Visiting Committee to the College of Harvard University. Bob had a strong commitment to education, which stemmed from his deep belief in giving back. At Harvard he established a professorship in Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as a scholarship program for financial aid students. Bob's passions and pride revolved around his family, which was always his priority. Bob lived a full and loving life. He was a devoted husband to Jane and a remarkable father to his five children, Robbie, Callie, Benny, Lissa and Katie. He is also survived by his older brother Morton A. Pierce, and nephews Matthew (Silvia) and Nicholas. The Pinkas family would like to sincerely acknowledge and thank The Cleveland Clinic's entire kidney and liver teams for their support these past two years, and especially recognize the unconditional guidance they received from Dr. Titte Srinivas. His burial was private, and a memorial service will be held Saturday, April 7, 2012 at 4:00pm at The Shaker Heights Country Club, 3300 Courtland Blvd, Shaker Heights, OH. For those who wish to honor his memory with a gift, his family would request donations to either the Robert Pinkas Scholarship Fund at Harvard University, c/o Harvard Recording Secretary, 124 Mount Auburn St., Cambridge, MA 02138, or The Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue Cleveland, OH 44195.

At the Equitable, he was president and chairman from 1967 to 1982 and was a founding member of VISA International. Owen married Marian Riggs Bailliere on November 17, 1950 in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to being the longest serving trustee of Gilman School, he was president of the Board from 1969 to 1975. He was a member of the Elkridge, Maryland, and Center Clubs.

She is the daughter of the late Oliver Russell Grace and Anne Inman and stepmother Lorraine Grace. She grew-up in Manhattan, East Hampton and Oyster Bay, New York. She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, Westover School in Middlebury, CT and Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. She was married to her first husband, Mr. Oliver Spencer, in 1956 until his untimely passing in 1958. On November 17, 1961 Helen Miller Grace Spencer married Ralph Manewal McDermid, Jr. at Saint Barnabus Church in Greenwich, CT with whom she had four children. She was a longtime resident of Greenwich and a member of the Greenwich Junior League. In the mid 1980's she found peaceful comfort and a spiritual connection with the Community of Jesus in Orleans, MA. She visited the community as often as she could, where members of the Community of Jesus seek to be instruments of the transforming love of Christ, that all may be brought to healing and wholeness in his name. She taught her family everything we know of compassion, generosity and kindness; her love was boundless and her heart would encompass the world. She was stylish, beautiful and elegant, and always surrounded by people who loved her dearly. Family was, hands-down, the most important thing in the world for her. She travelled constantly, visiting with her children and grandchildren, taking them on family trips all over the world, that over the years have kept her family together. She had a sense of humor that was sidesplitting, even when she didn't mean to be. She loved and wrote eloquent poetry and was fluent in French. There are no words to express our deepest sorrow at losing the warmest light in our lives. She created new memories for us everyday, and we found guidance in her unique views on every way to live in this world. She gained strength through faith and knows that her journey into the light of our Lord is a greatness to celebrate! Helen taught unconditional love everyday to her four children Ralph Grace and his wife Margaret, Alice Chilton (Jill) and her husband Erik, Mark Grace, Helen Frances (Fran) and her partner Sylvia. She loved very deeply her five grandchildren Gray, William, Maisie, Noah, and Sorijah. Her mother, Anne Inman, her stepmother Lorraine Grace and her siblings Anne Kelly, Ruth Jervis, Oliver Grace, John Grace, Lori Grace, Wendy Grace, Dr. Edward Kendall, Donna Kendall and cousin Natalie Dejoux, survive her.

2012-03-25T00:00:00Z,"SPRING weather usually tosses a lot of bad fashion trends onto the city's sidewalks. But this year, with our strangely early spring, the journey between my house and Bergdorf's is absolutely perilous. I worry -- I do! -- about those late-middle-aged women in super-high platforms and skinny J Brand jeans. A ballerina in toe shoes would have more contact with the pavement than these babes do. Women love platform shoes, for their sense of superiority and comfort (relative to other high heels); I love platforms. For 20 years I had a favorite pair of Lagerfeld black suede platforms -- from the era of Karl Lagerfeld's high-fashion label, with crisscross ankle straps -- that almost every year I left at Shoe Service on West 55th Street for a perk-up. As men know, good shoes can be repaired and worn for a long time, and the Lagerfeld platforms, aside from being well made, were a classic sin trap style -- sexy and shapely but rather modest in height."

Freeman and Nanette Carter; and devoted grandfather to Eva Freeman, Nina Hanlon and Leah Haskin, Matthew Carter's success as a public official stemmed from his strong faith in humanity and in Christianity.

2012-03-25T00:00:00Z,"A shining era is captured in ''ORDINARY MIRACLES: THE PHOTO LEAGUE'S NEW YORK,'' a documentary account of the Photo League, a cooperative that in the 1930s and '40s exerted a pivotal influence on American photography. Its prevailing aesthetic, a byproduct of the Great Depression, combined ambitious composition with a social-minded agenda. Created by two City College dropouts, Sol Libsohn and the passionate, imposing Sid Grossman, the league attracted luminaries like Dorothea Lange, Weegee and Lisette Model. Its school and exhibitions drew guests like Margaret Bourke-White, Henri Cartier Bresson and Ansel Adams. The league encouraged its members to roam the city and direct an intimate eye at urban subjects, and its newsletter addressed the role of photography in the political climate. But its progressive sensibility made it a victim of the cold war: in 1949 a government informer accused Grossman of being a Communist, and by 1951 the league collapsed. But its spirit endures in this record, narrated by the actor Campbell Scott and featuring 350 wondrous images spanning 15 years. A conversation with the directors, Nina Rosenblum and Daniel Allentuck, follows.

Now Democrats seem to be embracing the term, launching a Twitter campaign that seeks to build positive associations for it."

(13, 49) FRONTLINE The phone hacking and police bribery investigations enveloping British tabloids owned by News Corporation have placed Rupert Murdoch, right, the company's 81-year-old chief executive, under increased scrutiny. He testified before a parliamentary panel in the matter and shuttered one disgraced property, the 168-year-old News of the World. In this edition of ''Frontline'' Lowell Bergman examines the scandal that has rocked Mr. Murdoch's media empire. 5:20 P.M. (Showtime 2) THE PERFECT HOST (2011) While putting the finishing touches on dinner party preparations, Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce) answers his door to find a man named John Taylor (Clayne Crawford), who is not a guest but rather a bank robber, looking for a place to hide. This man talks his way inside but becomes a threat once his cover is blown. Warwick plies the thief with strong wine to knock him out, and once he has taken back control of the situation, he reveals his own dark side. ''Like Warwick himself, the movie begins to run amok after a taut and tantalizing first act,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''Not even Mr. Hyde Pierce's best efforts can make sense of a character who by the end of the film seems to be a completely different person with the same name.''"

2012-03-27T00:00:00Z,"SPENCER--Edson White, age 85, passed away peacefully at home in Wayzata, MN on March 25, 2012 after a valiant battle with PSP. He was surrounded by his wife of 62 years Harriet, and their four children, Linda Spencer Murchison, Edson W. Spencer Jr., Douglas Stuart Spencer and James McClure Spencer. Born June 4, 1926, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Spencer served in the U.S. Navy and was honorably discharged in 1946. A graduate of Williams College, he went on to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, earning an M.A. in 1950. He and Harriet McClure Stuart married in August 1950. He worked for Sears Roebuck in Sioux City, IA, La Crosse, WI, and in Venezuela before settling in Minneapolis in 1954. Ed began his 32 year career at Honeywell as an aeronautical engineer, then as Regional Manager for Honeywell Asia based in Tokyo, Japan from 1959 to 1964. He ultimately served as Chairman and CEO of Honeywell from 1973-1987. During that time he served on the boards of Norwest Corporation, CBS, and American Express Mutual Funds Group, and the international advisory boards of NEC, Chase Manhattan Bank, and Robert Bosch, Gmbh. Ed's personal interests were many and varied and he brought passion, insight and intellectual curiosity to everything he took on. He was most proud of his service on the boards of the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Mayo Foundation and the Minneapolis Foundation. Throughout his career he pursued his interest in US Japan relations with membership on the U.S. Japan Business Council and the Trilateral Commission. Additionally, he served on Governor Perpich's Blue Ribbon Commission on the University of Minnesota, Governor Carlson's Roundtable on Higher Education, and the Board of Carleton College. Ed was actively engaged in the Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota and a dedicated advisor to the Center for Victims of Torture. Between many a trip to interesting places around the world you could find Ed (and Harriet) casting a line in the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone in Northwestern Wyoming. Deeply committed to the national treasure that is Yellowstone National Park, he and Harriet were founders of the Yellowstone Park Foundation, and served on the Advisory Board of the National Parks and Conservation Association. Spencer was accomplished athlete who enjoyed competition throughout his life. He was an excellent college hockey and tennis player; later in life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, fly fishing and hiking. These many professional accomplishments never masked what was most important to him, which was spending time with family and friends. He is survived by his wife Harriet; children Linda (Reid) Murchison, Ed (Val) Spencer, Doug (Kathleen Parrish) Spencer and Jim (Polly) Spencer, and nine wonderful grandchildren, Sarah (Andy), Clare, Emily, Julia, Katie, Alison, Teddy, James, and Michael. The family would like to express special appreciation to Becky Fredericks and her team of nurses for their gracious and wonderful care, and to Allina Hospice Care. A memorial service will be held at the Wayzata Community Church on Tuesday, April 3rd at 3pm. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts can be made to Cure PSP, 30 E. Padonia Road, Suite 201, Timonium, MD 21093; www.curepsp.org; The Center for Victims of Torture, 649 Dayton Avenue St. Paul, MN 55104; www.cvt.org; or The Mayo Foundation: www.mayoclinic.org."

The Mexican War of Independence, not the Mexican revolution, started in 1810 in the mining area of Guanajuato, the heart of Catholic Mexico where the pope spoke at an outdoor Mass on Sunday. The group at the center of a sexual abuse scandal that has angered Mexican Catholics is the Legionaries of Christ or the Legion of Christ, but not the Legions of Christ. And it was Benedict who removed the Legionaries's founder, the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, in 2006 after Father Maciel was accused of being a drug addict who abused teenage seminarians and fathered several children. He did not remove Father Maciel when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. (He became pope in 2005.)"

Rock the Vote, a national organization that encourages young people to vote, began an effort last week to register high school students around the nation -- but not in Florida, over fears that teachers could face fines. And on college campuses, the once-ubiquitous folding tables piled high with voter registration forms are now a rarer sight."

2012-03-28T00:00:00Z,"In today's ramped-up bar culture, the sweetness of Curaçao or Triple Sec, the orange liqueurs used in many classic cocktails, did not satisfy David Wondrich, the drinks historian and expert. So he worked with Alexandre Gabriel, the president of Cognac Ferrand in France, to develop a drier bitter orange Curaçao, like the kind made back in the 1800s. They researched 19th-century recipes, and the result is Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao Ancienne Méthod, made with an infusion of the dried skins of Seville oranges in unaged, clear brandy. The spirit is redistilled and blended with Cognac, seasonings like anise and grilled sugar, and more orange peels. It is then barrel-aged and emerges smooth, veiled with orange, kissed with sweetness and hinting of juniper, almonds and vanilla. Mr. Wondrich wrote the tasting and historic notes on the label."

The state's new elections law -- which requires groups that register voters to turn in completed forms within 48 hours or risk fines, among other things -- has led the state's League of Women Voters to halt its efforts this year. Rock the Vote, a national organization that encourages young people to vote, began an effort last week to register high school students around the nation -- but not in Florida, over fears that teachers could face fines. And on college campuses, the once-ubiquitous folding tables piled high with voter registration forms are now a rarer sight."

2012-03-28T00:00:00Z,"FINERMAN--Jane, born April 23, 1937, passed away on Sunday, March 25, 2012. She was the daughter of Dr. Irvin and Dorothy Stein of Philadelphia. She attended the Friends' Select School in Philadelphia and cherished her summers spent at Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Maine. In 1959, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where she met her first husband, Dr. Gerald Finerman. The Finermans raised their children in Beverly Hills, California. Jane taught elementary school, specializing in bilingual education, in the Los Angeles Unified School District for many years. While teaching, she also earned a Master's Degree in Education from California State University, Northridge. After raising her children, Jane relocated to Boca Raton, Florida, where she continued to teach and eventually remarried Carl Hutman, to whom she was married for the last 14 years of her life. In recent years, Jane and Carl divided their time between Boca Raton and New York City, to be closer to their children and grandchildren. Beloved by her large family and legions of friends, Jane was, by all accounts, a force of nature opinionated and strong-willed, never afraid to speak her mind. She was deeply compassionate and concerned for others. She possessed a sharp mind and was known for her quick wit. Above all else, Jane had a passion for early childhood education and children's literacy. She was dedicated to her children's and grandchildren's educations and was immensely proud of their successes in life. A devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and sister, Jane is survived by her husband, Carl Hutman; her daughter, Wendy (David); son, Mark (Lisa); daughter, Karen (Lawrence); daughter, Leslie (Sean); and daughter, Stacey, as well as two step-daughters, Debbie Meisenzahl (Bill) and Susan Arndt (Daniel). She was predeceased by her son, Scott. Jane leaves behind thirteen grandchildren, whom she adored: Dorothy, Henry, James, Grace, Lucy, Jack, Alex, Drew, Kate, William, Tess, Lars, and Ellis. She is also survived by her sisters, Kathy Sachs and Margery Schab. Services Wednesday, March 28, 3pm at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65 Street.

But this year, Marvel's superhero team ''The Avengers'' will be the final act of the annual gathering, on April 28. ''The Avengers,'' starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson, was directed by Joss Whedon, best known for the television series ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' The comic, first published in 1963, unites Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Captain America to battle evildoers. The movie, which will be released nationally on May 4, is expected to be one of the biggest box-office draws this summer. As part of the publicity extravaganza, the festival is inviting what it calls ''everyday heroes'' from uniformed agencies and the military to attend the screening and meet the cast. ''Marvel's 'The Avengers' is an exciting ride that absolutely transports audiences,'' Jane Rosenthal, one of the founders of the festival, said in a statement. ''It is the perfect way to end our 11th Festival.'' More information can be found on the festival Web site."

2012-03-29T00:00:00Z,"WILSON--Isabel Brown. The staff and Board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, acknowledge with great sorrow the death, on March 27, of MFAH Life Trustee and former Chairman Isabel Brown Wilson, at 80. Mrs. Wilson's philanthropy had a transformative impact not only on the MFAH but also on the arts, culture and civic life of Houston. She was extraordinarily generous with her time, energy, opinion and resources. Following the tradition of leadership of her legendary family, and in particular that of her mother, Alice Pratt Brown, Mrs. Wilson became an MFAH Trustee in 1979 and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2001. She was the second woman to hold this position; her mother was the first, in 1973, having spearheaded the building of the museum's Brown Pavilion, which was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and opened in 1974. During Mrs. Wilson's six-year tenure as Chairman, the MFAH collections and programs grew dramatically, with nearly 16,000 works of art acquired and more than 200 exhibitions presented. Over the course of 30 years, she and her husband, Wallace Wilson; and The Brown Foundation, Inc., made possible the acquisition of major works of art by Rembrandt, Jean-Simeon Chardin, J.M.W. Turner, Georgia O'Keeffe and James Turrell, as well as significant antiquities. In the 1980s and 1990s, the museum's endowment grew at an unprecedented rate, largely as the result of a Brown Foundation challenge grant that Mrs. Wilson initiated. The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, has lost a treasured family member and extends deepest condolences to Mrs. Wilson's husband, Wallace Wilson; and to her family."

2012-03-29T00:00:00Z,"It has been nine years since a rather futile protest brought the issue of Augusta National's lack of female members to the fore, but this year it has risen again -- in a much thornier form for the club that hosts the Masters. In 2003, it was Martha Burk, then the chairwoman of the National Council of Women's Organizations, who decided to press the issue of Augusta's all-male membership, but now, it stems from I.B.M.'s decision last year to name Virginia M. Rometty as its chief executive. Traditionally, I.B.M. chief executives are invited to join Augusta, which isn't a tradition that would get shoved aside lightly because I.B.M. remains one of only three main sponsors of the Masters. But Augusta has not only never had a female member, its former chairman Hootie Johnson famously responded to Burk's challenge with his declaration that he wouldn't be forced ''at the point of a bayonet'' to admit women."
2012-03-29T00:00:00Z,"Ernest Hemingway first met Gianfranco Ivancich in 1949 at a bar in Venice, where the two struck up a conversation about their war experiences. It was the beginning of a epistolary friendship. Hemingway remained close to Mr. Ivancich, a member of a noble Venetian family, and his sister, Adriana, whom Hemingway credited with inspiring his 1952 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ''The Old Man and the Sea'' during her visit to Cuba in 1950. Now the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation is making available 15 letters it bought from Mr. Ivancich, now in his early 80s, that Hemingway wrote between 1953 and 1960 as he wandered through Cuba; Ketchum, Idaho; Kilimanjaro; Nairobi; Paris; and Madrid. The library also acquired a manuscript of ''The Faithful Bull,'' a tale that Hemingway wrote for Mr. Ivancich's nephew. The letters -- at turns chatty, amusing and touching -- offer a glimpse into Hemingway's more private self. In one, above, dated Feb. 22, 1953, from Cuba, he describes having to shoot his beloved cat Willie after he was hit by a car. Someone else offered to do the job, but Hemingway writes that he could not risk ''a chance of Will knowing anybody was killing him.'' He goes on to say that a group of tourists unexpectedly drove up: ''I still had the rifle, and I explained to them they had come at a bad time and to please understand and go away. But the rich Cadillac psycho said: 'We have come at a most interesting time. Just in time to see the great Hemingway cry because he has to kill a cat.' '' In response, he writes, ''I humiliated him as he should be humiliated, omit details.''"

2012-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His book, ''The Behavior Gap,'' was published earlier this year. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog. We live relatively short lives. Most of us last less than 100 years, so it's no surprise that we often get caught in the trap of small sample sizes. Imagine, for instance, if you go to Seattle for two days, and it's sunny both days. You may start to think all these stories of rain are just a trick by the locals to keep you from moving there. But it's only two days. What about the other 363 (or 364) days?"

Ms. Lohan, 25, remains on informal probation for taking a necklace without permission last year, but she no longer must report to a probation officer, limit her travel or show up for weekly cleaning shifts at a morgue.

2012-03-31T00:00:00Z,"The Metropolitan Opera has announced that concurrent with its final live presentation of the Robert Lepage production of Wagner's ''Ring des Nibelungen'' this spring (May 5-12), it will begin broadcasting the complete ''Ring'' cycle to movie theaters around the world, recycling the HD transmissions of the individual operas as they appeared over the last two seasons. On May 7, in the United States, Canada and some other countries, the Met will present ''Wagner's Dream,'' a documentary on the production by Susan Froemke. The opera screenings will take place in the United States on May 9 (''Das Rheingold''), May 14 (''Die Walküre''), May 16 (''Siegfried'') and May 19 (''Götterdämmerung''). Screenings abroad will take place at various times, extending in some cases into summer and, in Japan, through August. This is said by the Met to be the first time a ''Ring'' cycle has been presented on a big screen, though the production will not be entirely unified, since the first two operas were recorded with James Levine conducting, the last two with Fabio Luisi. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-03-31T00:00:00Z,"Just five months before he died, Louis Armstrong gave a performance at the National Press Club in Washington, singing and playing the trumpet for nearly a half-hour at a party for the club's newly elected president. That concert was recorded by CBS newsmen who attended the event, and the press club later pressed about 300 vinyl copies and distributed them to journalists who had attended. It was never released as a commercial album, even though it was one of the last times the jazz trumpeter performed before his death in July 1971. Now Smithsonian Folkways Recordings has gotten permission from the Armstrong estate to release the recordings on a new album, ''Satchmo at the National Press Club: Red Beans and Rice-ly Yours,'' which will come out April 24 as part of the Smithsonian's annual Jazz Appreciation Month, the label and the press club announced on Thursday."

2012-03-31T00:00:00Z,"When a German art conservator recently sought to authenticate an early painting by Robert Motherwell that she had inherited, the director of the artist's New York foundation told her there was both good news and bad news. The work, ''Figuration,'' a charming 1947 oil on masonite, was real. But, the art conservator was told, the painting was stolen. On Friday the Motherwell, along with three other paintings that were stolen from a Madison Avenue gallery in 1988 and now valued at $1 million, were recovered by police in Cologne, Germany, and turned over to the Art Loss Register, a private database of lost and stolen art. The works were part of a batch of a half dozen contemporary paintings that were swiped from the now-defunct Solomon Gallery during a weekend theft. One, a painting by Karel Appel, was recovered in 2003 when the owner, a German dealer, tried to get it authenticated. According to Christopher A. Marinello, executive director and general counsel of the register, the dealer said he had bought the painting during a trip to New York City but refused to reveal the seller's identity. A lawyer handled all the negotiations, so the German dealer's name was never disclosed to law enforcement."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"It's a strangely moving experience to flip through ''Woodcut'' (Princeton Architectural Press, $30), a book of Bryan Nash Gill's relief prints of tree-trunk cross sections, which the artist harvests from felled trees, cedar telephone poles and discarded fence posts in his native Connecticut. One is struck by how Gill's method - cutting blocks with a chain saw, sanding them down, burning them and sealing them with shellac - amplifies the events in the life of a tree: lightning strikes, burgeoning burls, insect holes and, of course, the aging process, evidence of which radiates out in transfixing patterns. Verlyn Klinkenborg, who also writes for The New York Times, describes these cross sections in the book's preface as ''the death mask of a plant, the sustained rigor mortis'' of maple, spruce and locust. They remind us, he says, that every biological form ''possesses a unique footprint.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"THANKS in large part to Alexa Chung, the tomboy look has been enjoying unprecedented appeal of late. But Ms. Chung was preceded by a long line of women who made stealing from the boys seem like the most stylish thing in the world, notably Katharine Hepburn, Françoise Hardy, Patti Smith, Jane Birkin and Ms. Birkin's two younger daughters, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon. ''Tomboy Style: Beyond the Boundaries of Fashion'' (Rizzoli, $32.50), a compact coffee-table tome, celebrates these style icons and their countless lesser-known sisters via dozens of vintage and contemporary photographs. ''It's become acceptable, even fashionable, to describe yourself as a tomboy,'' said Lizzie Garrett Mettler, the book's author and the creator of the Tomboy Style blog from which it sprang. ''It doesn't have butch connotations anymore.'' Her favorite image is one of Steve McQueen and his first wife, Neile Adams, shooting pistols in the desert. McQueen is something of a unifying thread in the book and a man with an evident weakness for tomboys: His second wife, Ali MacGraw, is pictured just a few pages later in a photo by William Claxton. It's one that is especially meaningful to Ms. Mettler. When they married, she said, McQueen ''bought her a house in Beachwood Canyon in L.A.,'' she said. ''Neighborhood legend has it that it's the house across the street from mine. I like to think the photo was taken there.'' NANCY MacDONELL"
2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"After Franco, the deluge! Or so it would seem from Anthology Film Archives' fascinating series, SPANISH CINEMA OF THE EARLY POST-FRANCO ERA (1975-83), which considers the flowering of film after his death in 1975. This was something of a coming-out party for all things underground and repressed: drugs, raucous experimentation and, of course, sex. A gay sensibility flourished, not only in the films of Pedro Almodóvar, represented here by ''Pepi, Luci, Bom y Otras Chicas del Montón'' and ''Laberinto de Pasiones,'' but also in movies like Ventura Pons's ''Ocaña,'' a 1978 documentary portrait of José Pérez Ocaña, an artist who walked around Barcelona in a peek-a-boo dress. The series, beginning Friday, features 10 films, most rarely seen in America, including Iván Zulueta's ''Arrebato'' (''Rapture''), a genre bender that is itself giddily enraptured by cinema. As one of its two filmmaker heroes says, ''It isn't me who loves film, but film who loves me.'' And beware an enthusiastic lover. Cinema, it seems, eats its young -- or at least its acolytes. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village; (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"There's one house in Bentonville, Ark., that looks nothing like the others. It was designed in 1954 by Cecil Stanfield, a Modernist architect who helped give Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., (two hours west) its ''Jetsons''-esque appearance. The house's large windows are the kind that people in small towns tend to associate with storefronts. That meant the lives of its owners would be displayed as surely as the merchandise in Sam Walton's first five-and-dime, just a few blocks away. Which made it, paradoxically, the right house for Don Bacigalupi, Dan Feder and their 6-year-old son, Guston. ''We live our lives very openly,'' says Feder, a graphic designer and stay-at-home dad, who has been with Bacigalupi, a respected museum director, since the early 1990s. Still, even Alice Walton, the Walmart scion who grew up in Bentonville, wasn't sure the couple would be happy raising their child there. After offering Bacigalupi the job of director of her Crystal Bridges Museum, in 2009, Walton insisted he get to know people in the Ozarks town before deciding. She even went ahead and found potential friends for the two men, via a gay employees group at Walmart. ''After knowing that Don was the right fit for us,'' Walton wrote in an e-mail, ''I wanted to be certain the community was the right fit for him and his family. That was my No. 1 priority.''"

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The interior designer Marco Pasanella is now enjoying a robust second act as a vintner, but first he had to triple his mortgage, max out his credit cards and risk his marriage. He details his metamorphosis in a new memoir, ''Uncorked'' (Clarkson Potter, $24). File this under perfect pairings: The psychedelic dot enthusiast Yayoi Kusama illustrates a new edition of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (Penguin Global, $35). It appears at the same time as her big Tate Modern museum show, which moves to the Whitney in June. Mona Talbott's ''Zuppe'' (The Little Book Room, $19) is as much a collection of inspiring Italian soup recipes - like puréed pea with mint - as it is a window into the eco-conscious, seasonal kitchen of the American Academy in Rome. And ''The Uninvited Guests'' (Harper, $25), a devilish comic novel by Sadie Jones, is set inside ''a strange, shallow red-brick manor house'' in ''Downton Abbey''-era England. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

His own home -- an Anglo-Italianate town house in downtown Manhattan -- showcases his aesthetic roots (''I grew up in Connecticut in the '70s, with that WASPy 'Ice Storm' sort of décor,'' he says) and contains works by his favorite artists and furniture designers (Joe Colombo and Vico Magistretti, to name two).

Wild boar roam free up here, rattlesnakes are routine, and the soil, what there is of it, soaks in high-perching water in the winter, dries out in the summer and rests on layers of oil-impregnated asphalt rock and chalky mudstone. It's a land where poison oak, burr clover and thistles thrive. All in all, not the most obvious spot for a garden, but that's what Stephanie Mills saw when she and her husband, David, bought this 372-acre ocean-view aerie, which they named Laguna Ranch, in 1991. From 1993 to 1995, Mills worked with the grass guru John Greenlee to help tame the invasive weeds that had taken hold after a failed brussels sprouts farm and years of ranching created optimum conditions for these opportunistic pests. ''The idea was to control the thistles and poison oak with grasses,'' she recalls. ''If you plant something, a thistle can't grow in its place.''"

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"''I'm hopelessly opinionated,'' says the designer Harriet Anstruther as she walks through the rooms of the mid-19th-century house in London that she shares with her husband, the photographer Henry Bourne, and her teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Indeed, this is not the home of someone who's wishy-washy on design and decorating. Anstruther - who has designed everything from scarves (two of which are in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum) to hotel rooms, and who consults for fashion and lifestyle companies, and for British institutions like the Design Museum - restored the elegant late-Georgian architecture of the house (which had been divided into three apartments) while making sure that the rooms weren't slaves to it. Wherever you look, traditional is engaged in conversation with modern, old furniture and art with new, and bold colors with white walls. The white walls, needless to say, aren't the product of indecision. ''Clarity keeps me calm,'' Anstruther explains. ''I like the architecture to be the story,'' she says, adding that white allows you to ''see the silhouette.'' On the main floor of the house, white emphasizes the modernity of the skylit, open kitchen-dining area, which is a new addition. (A glass insert in the dining-area floor sends light down to Bourne's basement-level studio, which opens onto a garden courtyard.) The kitchen's white marble counters, Anstruther acknowledges, are highly impractical, but she doesn't care. ''I dreamt about unlacquered brass and white marble,'' she recalls."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Ward Bennett (1917-2003) was one of design's great American success stories. He left home at 13, created dresses and window displays, met Brancusi and studied painting with Hans Hofmann - before he was 30. When he turned to design, his clients included David Rockefeller, Gianni Agnelli and Jann and Jane Wenner. Bennett used industrial materials before they were chic and insisted that his furniture be comfortable. Many of his designs went out of production, leaving aficionados to hunt the secondhand market. But now Herman Miller is adding several Bennett pieces (including the Scissor chair and I-Beam table shown here) to its Herman Miller Collection, a portfolio of products for home and office that also includes classics by the Eameses, Nelson and Noguchi; contemporary designers like Sam Hecht, Leon Ransmeier and Ayse Birsel; and the Italian brands Magis and Mattiazzi.

He was the master of the High-Low (poker) and the high-low (life), an American original, which he didn't get from his voracious intelligence or savvy, but rather from his eye and ear and heart.

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The cover of Mark Dion's Phaidon monograph describes him as a ''celebrated artist/explorer/archeologist.'' Not three vocations that ordinarily inhere in one man (though some improbable combination of Audubon and Indiana Jones might cover it) and not the full tally of Dion's occupations, either. To them can be added: teacher, naturalist, advocate, author, designer, collector (that is to say, hoarder), curator and probably six or seven other things I don't have room for here. Dion is one of those curious characters the world produces every so often; men and women who combine making things with intervening in the institutions that show them - in museums and schools, in cities and far-flung sites, disrupting the flow and structure of our picture of the world just enough to make us wonder why we give it that structure and flow in the first place. Dion's a collector of collections, especially the hundreds or thousands (or more - who knows how many?) hidden in forgotten buildings in small cities around the world: Cabinets of Wonder, specimen museums, obscure archives, as well as the complex and uncataloged collections of things, both manufactured and natural, one might find in, say, a patch of the rain forest or a bank of the Thames. In February, he was in New York working on ''Phantoms of the Clark Expedition,'' an exhibition that explores, among other things, the Explorers Club - the venerable members-only institution. The installation, which runs from May 9 to Aug. 3, is part critical, part fond, and is intended to show, through artist-made objects, what such endeavors don't reveal about themselves. Dion is an owlish man with an Encyclopedia Brown air about him, who lives in an apartment in Washington Heights with his wife, their dog and a kind of controlled clutter of books, knickknacks, souvenirs and the like. When I visited him there, a fishbowl on the living room table seemed to be filled with matchbooks and old receipts; a few minutes later, it stirred, alarmingly. ''That's the mouse,'' he said casually, and then we went back to our conversation, which roamed all over the world, back millenniums and up to the present again. Endangered species, Renaissance customs, a periscope contraption that Freud had installed in his office in Vienna (whence Dion had just returned) so that he could spy on patients sitting in his waiting room. A very good artist can do a lot; surprisingly few of them know a lot, at least outside of their immediate concerns. Dion is one of the exceptions, perhaps because his immediate concern is . . . everything."

A son of Daniel Redmond and the former Mildred Phelan, Jack was born in Berwyn, PA on December 1st, 1930. After graduation from Villanova University with a BS in Civil Engineering in 1953, he was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy as a Chief Engineer on the USS Robert L. Wilson (DDE847), retiring as a Lieutenant in 1958. Upon discharge from the Navy, Jack joined the Wilbur B. Driver Company, a family owned manufacturer of alloys, and earned his M.S. in Metallurgy at Stevens Institute of Technology in 1960. After the subsequent sale of the Wilbur B.

In 1970, he became a general partner of Fowler, Rosenau & Company, the NYSE Specialist firm. He retired in 1995 as the firm's senior partner. Mr Redmond lived in Llewellyn Park, West Orange for many years where, with his former wife Claire Driver Redmond, who passed away in 2003, he raised six children, John Jr. (Nancy), Robert (Elise), Suzanne Anderson (Robert), Richard (Jane), Paul (Donna), and Ruth Bloom (William). He also maintained former residences in Longboat Key, Florida; Bondville, Vermont; and Convent Station, New Jersey. He was an important Benefactor to his beloved Villanova University, and was recognized as a Distinguished Alumni in 1988 and became a member of the President's Forum in 1995.

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"For many Bostonians, the beauty of spring means the installation of the 20-foot-long scarlet nasturtium vines in the flower-filled courtyard of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The process suggests a ballet, much like the dancing figures on the sarcophagus above, as workers carry the vines through the 50-foot glass tunnel connecting the new wing to the original Venetian-palace-style museum. Stan Kozak, who grows the vines and directs the process, hung the vines over balustrades. Elsewhere, women seem to be taking cues from the museum's Renaissance portraits, experimenting with elaborate hairstyles decorated with jewels. Not since the '30s have we seen such imaginative, intricate styling, a departure from ironed flat hair."

A framed, somewhat faded dinosaur mural reigns over the space; herds of small plastic animals roam the shelf above her worktable. Sometimes it's hard to tell the found objects from the art. The question of what is real and what is not is at the heart of Garofalo's work. Her spiky, surreal porcelain pieces are neither plant nor animal. She is most drawn, she says, to things that look familiar but are sui generis: ''The idea of species intermingling intrigues me, and it's boring to make something that already exists.''"

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"MILLER--Dr. Arthur Dr. Arthur Miller, 93, a practicing physician in New York for 70 years, passed away from natural causes surrounded by family and friends on Monday evening, March 19th. After attending NYU and NYU Medical School, he and his brother, Dr. Julius Miller joined the US Navy as medical officers. He served with distinction in the Pacific Theater during WWII and, was present during the battles of Iwo Jima (witnessed the raising of the flag), Okinawa and Guam in the Philippines. After 4++ years of service to his country, Dr. Miller recommitted himself to the profession of medicine specializing in Obstetrics/Gynecology and ultimately Fertility/Sterility and Cancer. In collaboration with fellow physicians from the Soviet Union, in the early 1960's he was responsible for introducing into the US the 'cervical sling', allowing for successful outcomes to very difficult pregnancies. In private practice he became one of New York City's most highly respected fertility and cancer specialists. Dr. Miller's attending privileges included: New York Infirmary Hospital, Bellevue Hospital, Beth Israel Medical Center, New York University Langone Hospital, and the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn Medical Center. Starting in 1952, Dr. Miller's passion for medicine and teaching led him to establish a post-graduate relationship with NYU Medical School as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. A pioneer in the advocacy of women's access to health care and reproductive rights, in 1953 Dr. Miller began donating part of his time to what became a life-long commitment to providing health care to members' families of the Mens' Clothing Workers Union at the Hillman Center in Manhattan. In the late 1960's Dr. Miller opened his 3rd office in New York across the hall from the joint practice of his father and brother (Dr. I. William Miller and Dr. Julius Miller). In 1972, following the US Supreme Court's Decision 'Roe v Wade', in partnership with Dr. Mansoor Day and Dr. Roy Gold, Dr Miller founded VIP Medical Associates in association with Beth Israel Medical Center, the first clinical practice to open in New York State devoted to providing abortion services to women of limited financial means. Continuing in private practice though his 90th birthday, his many honors and recognition included: Diplomate, American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Fellow, American College of Surgeons; Fellow, International College of Surgeons; Fellow, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Chairman, Committee on Admissions, NY Academy of Medicine; Fellow, Pan American Medical Association; Fellow, American Fertility Society. In a statement made shortly after Dr. Miller's death, Dr. Anthony Greco, Associate Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, said of Dr. Miller he set the bar. His was a large life defined by more than his career. He was Arthur in his private life and found equal joy in his roles as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, father-in-law, and friend. He loved traveling with his family, ocean swimming, winning rounds of golf, telling (and retelling!) bawdy jokes, attending the symphony and the opera in a tuxedo and cape with red lining, wearing a finely cut suit set off by the perfectly selected tie, and sharing good meals and fine wine with those he loved. More than anything, he loved seeing the transformation of his lovely granddaughter Ruth into a fine young woman A well lived life cannot help but leave a large absence when it ends. Dr. Arthur Miller will long be remembered and missed deeply by all who knew and loved him. A member of the Town and Village Synagogue, he is survived by his wife of 63 years Hope Simon, sons Lane (of Seattle, WA) and Lloyd (of Anchorage, Alaska), daughters-in-law Anne and Heather, and granddaughter Ruth. He was preceded in death by his son Scott."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"The corner of McGuinness and Kent, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, has undergone a minor face-lift in the seven years since my aunt Liz was struck and killed there. The Budget Rental Center that occupied the east corner is now an Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and there's a new BP service station across the street from it, in what used to be a vacant lot. You can no longer park on the east side of McGuinness, because the gas station's driveway flows out into the street there. Seven years ago, before the gas station, a row of parked trucks lined the curb, and it is for that reason that the driver of the Budget rental van, turning left onto Kent, was unable to see Liz as she rode her bike from the sidewalk to the street. A few months later, a group of activists chained a white-painted bicycle to a signpost across the street from the site of the accident. Above it, a plaque states her name and the day she died, and how: ''killed by truck.'' You can see these ''ghost bikes'' all around the city, wherever cyclists lost their lives."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Sophie Aschauer has been fascinated by puzzles since she was a child. But it wasn't until she picked up a book of sailor's knots last year on a trip to Nantucket, Mass., that she put this interest to any practical use. ''I was mesmerized,'' says Aschauer, a New York-based, Austrian-born graduate of Central Saint Martins, who designs under the label SerpentSea. ''Right away, I knew I was going to make them into mats.'' Each of her small but weighty rugs incorporates about 150 feet of repurposed nautical and mountaineering rope, which she coaxes into intricate patterns that loop and twine like baroque infinity symbols. The hands-on process takes about four hours per rug; devising the patterns can take considerably longer. She has three models available, all named for famous pirates - Drake, Bonny and Morgan - and a larger area rug is in the works. ''People love them as bathmats,'' Aschauer says. ''They feel very nice under bare feet.''"
2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"WEINSCHENK--Fritz. An American hero is no longer with us. The members of the board of directors of the Otto and Fran Walter Foundation mourn the passing on March 23, 2012, of their esteemed fellow director and treasurer of the Foundation, our dear friend Dr. jur. Fritz Weinschenk. Driven from his German homeland by Nazi hatred, he made a new life for himself in the United States. He volunteered for the U.S. Army immediately after Pearl Harbor and underwent training in South and North Carolina, in the course of which he was naturalized as a citizen. He liked to say that he considered himself a Rebel, since he became an American citizen in the South. He came ashore under Eisenhower at Omaha Beach on D-Day, where he incurred a leg wound that would plague him the rest of his life; he refused being sent to a field hospital, because that would have separated him from his unit. That unit was trained in beachhead communications, so after two months in France it was transferred to the Pacific. There, after participating in landings at Port Moresby, Hollandia (now Jayapura) and Sansapor in New Guinea, Fritz came ashore with MacArthur in the Philippines, first at Lingayen Gulf and later at Malapascua Island/Mt. Mayon. His unit was preparing for the invasion of Japan when the war ended. ""The atomic bomb,"" he later said, ""saved my life."" His military honors include the American Campaign Medal, European--African--Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star and an arrowhead, Presidential Unit Citation (for the Normandy invasion), Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two battle stars and an arrowhead, World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal and Good Conduct Medal; and foreign honors, the Philippine Liberation Medal and the Medaille de la Debarquement (French Liberation Medal). After his discharge he served as a civilian in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps in Germany, in the course of which he worked with the U.S. prosecution team in the trial of German war criminals at Nuremberg. Returning to the U.S., he took up the study of law, graduating from New York University School of Law in 1953, and then devoted the greater part of his long professional career to the pursuit of justice on behalf of those who, like himself, had suffered under Hitler's brutal regime. He interviewed hundreds of witnesses whose testimony was critical for the prosecution of war criminals in German courts, and served as counsel for Nazi victims in hundreds of restitution and indemnification claims. For his humanitarian service the German government bestowed upon him the Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande (Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit) and the Bundesverdienstkreuz erster Klasse (Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit). Late in life he again took up the study of law and earned the degree of Doktor juris, summa cum laude, from the University of Mainz the city from which he had been ostracized half a century earlier. He served in many capacities in numerous philanthropic and professional organizations, but the one that means the most to us is our own. We will miss his insight and wise counsel, as well as his unfailing courtesy and sly humor, at our board meetings. Otto and Fran Walter Foundation, Inc Frank G. Helman, President Martha H. Peak, Vice President and Grants Director"

The Blue Lagoon is near the capital on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The Svartsengi thermal power station nearby heats the sea water in ''hot pots'' underground. By the time it reaches the lagoon, it cools to 38 degrees Celsius. It is surrounded by rough lava fields covered with a delicate moss. The contrast between the landscape and the baths was spectacular. We had no idea that it would be so strange. SUSAN STAVA, New City, N.Y."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Most of us don't think of craft as holy. But it certainly was for cloistered nuns of the 17th through 19th centuries, who made reliquaries of rolled or ''quilled'' paper that was adorned with beads, shells, coral, fabric and other materials. Nearly 150 of these pieces will be on view in ''Quilling: Devotional Creations From Cloistered Orders'' at the Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli in Turin, Italy, from April 5 through Sept. 2. A number of works in the show are owned by the photographer Nan Goldin, who shot some of the pieces in the exhibition.

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"BEFORE brands were brands, they were just companies with stories and nice carpeting. I remember going into the Mark Cross store on Fifth Avenue with my parents. (This was in the late '60s.) There was an unfussy elegance to that store, just as there was to the main floor of Tiffany up the street, and it's not hard to picture guys in sack suits and skinny ties, maybe a rumpled khaki raincoat, going to check out the desk blotters. I was looking at the photo in The New Yorker this week that accompanies Robert A. Caro's article about Lyndon B. Johnson on the day of the Kennedy assassination -- it shows the president and a group of men, including reporters, leaving a Fort Worth hotel. Their uniformity (''Johnson hastily snatched off his hat,'' Mr. Caro noted), their desire for uniformity, is something that ''Mad Men'' fails to capture. But, of course, it is interested in entertainment, not in subtle differences of taste and body types."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Almost immediately after the so-called grand bargain between President Obama and the Republican speaker of the house, John Boehner, unraveled last July, the two sides quickly settled into dueling, self-serving narratives of what transpired behind closed doors. In the months that followed, some of Washington's most connected Democrats and Republicans told me in casual conversations that they didn't know whose story to believe, or even what, exactly, had been on the table during the negotiations. A few mentioned, independently of one another, that the entire affair reminded them of ''Rashomon,'' the classic Kurosawa film in which four characters filter the same murder plot through their different perspectives. Over time, the whole debacle became the perfect metaphor for a city in which the two parties seem more and more to occupy not just opposing places on the political spectrum, but distinct realities altogether. There is a practical reason for this. Both sides knew that if the most crucial and contested details of their deliberations became public, it would complicate relationships with some of their most important constituencies in Washington -- or worse. It's one thing for a Democratic president to embrace painful cuts in Medicare and Social Security benefits, or for a Republican speaker to contemplate raising taxes, if they can ultimately claim that they've joined together to make the hard decisions necessary for the country; it's quite another thing to shatter the trust of your most ideological allies and come away with nothing to show for it. Obama and Boehner have clung to their separate realities not just because it's useful to blame each other for the political dysfunction in Washington, but because neither wants to talk about just how far he was willing to go."

Part bird, part snake, Quetzalcoatl was the region's founding father and benefactor. A new exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art argues that he was also a lasting political and economic phenomenon, allowing the southern kingdoms to resist conquest by the Aztecs and, later, the Spanish. Some indigenous Mexicans still call themselves descendants of Quetzalcoatl. Opening Sunday, ''CHILDREN OF THE PLUMED SERPENT: THE LEGACY OF QUETZALCOATL IN ANCIENT MEXICO'' connects Quetzalcoatl to the development of vast trade routes that reached from central Mexico out to the Yucatán Peninsula and the American Southeast. It also credits him with inspiring the simplified International Style in art, which helped to knit together a group of ethnically diverse and multilingual communities. The show's more than 200 art objects date from the postclassic to the early colonial periods (roughly 900 to 1521), and include gold, textiles, turquoise mosaics, fresco fragments, painted codices and feather work.

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"IT'S not true that David Auburn vanished after the blockbuster success of ''Proof'' around a dozen years ago. But to some theater people waiting for another Pulitzer Prize-winning play it can feel that way. He's actually been very busy, working on screenplays, adaptations, one-acts and an HBO pilot about a surgeon starring Kevin Kline. But in terms of completely original new drama -- a scarce resource on Broadway this spring -- ''THE COLUMNIST,'' which begins previews this week, represents a major return for Mr. Auburn and a good sign for audiences. This play features John Lithgow as Joseph Alsop, the powerful columnist and critic of Communism, who in the 1950s discovered that the K.G.B. had photos of him having sex with a Russian man in a Moscow hotel room. With political events like the Kennedy assassination as the backdrop, Mr. Auburn tracks Alsop's life in the '50s and '60s. In interviews the playwright said he wanted to give a complicated portrait of this fascinating figure who has been largely forgotten. The prolific Daniel Sullivan, who earned (surprisingly) his only Tony Award for ''Proof,'' is directing. Performances begin Wednesday at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan; (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"BOGART--Vincent L. Vincent L. Bogart was born on the family farm near Kirwin, KS, on June 8, 1922. Vince died on Monday, March 26, in his home surrounded by loved ones. After high school and one year of college, he traveled to Washington, D.C., and became a Federal Reserve Board page. He attended George Washington University at night, joined Sigma Nu, and enlisted in the Army Air Force Cadets in August 1942. Vince was commissioned as a 1st Lieutenant fighter pilot, was assigned to the Aleutians and later trained combat pilots before his inactivation. With the GI Bill running out, he began at Kansas State University and met his future wife, Julia R. Henry, in April 1951, on a blind date. They both loved acting and appeared in plays together and each received a best actor Oscar. After marriage in August 1952, he entered Washburn Law School. Graduated in 1955 with a LLB, he was hired by a large Wichita law firm, served one term in the Kansas state legislature, was elected president of the West Side Democratic Club and Chairman for Sedgwick County Democratic Committee. In 1960, John Kennedy appealed to Vince for support with the Kansas delegation to win the nomination in July and the election in November. Vince hosted Kennedy's first visit to Wichita and drove Ted Sorensen and Larry O'Brien to campaign speeches. Sorensen and O'Brien joked in the car that Kennedy was such a speech deviant. Ted Kennedy also came to Wichita to promote his brother's candidacy. Vince started his own law firm and was elected to the Wichita City Commission in 1963-67 and as Mayor in 1964-65. He represented Wichita at Orleans Joan d' Arc festival and gave a speech in perfect French. Judy and Vince were invited with other Mayors to meet President Johnson at the White House. The mayors discussed the Vietnam War with the President. Afterwards, the couple dined and joined others dancing in the foyer. President Johnson cut-in to dance with Judy and drawled ""Are you having a good time?"" During Vince's tenure, he supported Johnson's war on poverty, passed a fair housing law, and signed a contract to construct Century II. He became Chairman State Democratic Platform Committee in 1966-67, was appointed WSU Board trustee, and then Governor Docking chose him as legislative representative. He was later appointed to the State Board of Regents. In 1968 Vince served on National Democratic Platform Committee and attended the Chicago National Convention as delegate. The Chicago convention was interrupted with a show of force between demonstrators and Mayor Daley's police. The joke among the delegates was to nominate Hubert Humphrey as President and Vince as Vice-President so the ticket would read Humphrey Bogart. In 1972-74 and 1976-77, he was special assistant to the Attorney General, State of Kansas. Vince served on the local, state and national Bar Associations, was a member of the state and local Trial Lawyers Association and was recognized in Who's Who in American Politics and Who's Who in American Lawyers. Vince served under Governor Sebelius as Judge of the Workmen's Compensation Court and ended his career as of counsel with a local law firm. Survivors include his much loved wife of nearly 60 years, Judy, their lovely children Candace Miller, Lee Bogart, Celeste Racette, and Cynthia Sandin, and their spouses. ""Oompa"" was the name affectionately given to him by his grandchildren; Renee, Matthew and Robert Racette, Janelle and Andrea Bogart, and Caitlin and Anders Miller. Private services held at the Bogart cemetery in Kirwin, KS, on Wednesday, March 28, 2012."

The lineup looks different depending on where and when he's playing; this 14-piece one is full of first-call New Yorkers.

''I'd cut out images of Kate Moss and Nadja Auermann for the covers,'' she says. An alumna of Paris Vogue and Interview, the Franco-Vietnamese Pellissier was named T's senior art director in 2011. For design stories like the one on Doug Aitken's herbaceous house (Page 78), she says, ''layouts have to explain a certain specificity of the architecture.'' As for fashion stories, ''It's all instinct.''"

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"Edith Minturn Stokes and Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes are best known today as the patrician subjects of this 1897 portrait by John Singer Sargent, which hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Banking and shipping heirs, Newton and Edith were at once wealthy globe-trotters and reform-minded New York liberals whose good deeds have endured even as the couple themselves drifted into obscurity. In a brisk, admiring dual biography, ''Love, Fiercely'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $26), Jean Zimmerman argues that theirs was perhaps ''the greatest love story never told.'' Sargent painted Edith in street clothes as the so-called New Woman who represented ''hot-button developments such as bloomers and bicycles.'' The straw boater hat Edith holds in the painting, Zimmerman says, could be interpreted as ''obscuring if not downright obliterating her husband's manhood.'' In life, Edith was, if not emasculating, at least tough. Nicknamed ''Fiercely,'' she flouted upper-crust norms: not marrying until an overripe 28, adopting a child openly and bringing kindergarten, then a radical concept, to the United States."

2012-04-01T00:00:00Z,"With one foot in Modernist cool and the other in vibrant Pop Art, Jonas Wood gives breathing room to densely patterned paintings of domestic interiors that celebrate the logic of incongruity. ''I think painting's fun,'' Wood says in ''Interiors,'' the catalog accompanying his exhibition, on view from Mar. 31 through May 12 at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles, where Wood lives. Austere his work is not. The bold parrot-and-leaf print on a bedspread that nearly consumes a guest room fairly shrieks at the unperturbed Bertoia wire chairs that face it. The Keith Haring figures on a bathroom shower curtain dance to the visual music of intersecting, overlapping grids of colored tile. As the son of art-inclined parents, Wood grew up in such environments, exaggerating them in paintings that pack multiple viewpoints, labyrinthine spaces and iconic images by Picasso, Matisse, Calder, Warhol and others into kicky cabinets of curiosities that feel just like home. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Done in India ink and watercolor, her work depicts creatures in fanciful scenarios: a goat rides his bicycle by lunar light; a tutu-wearing bird skips rope on the back of a ballet-slippered goat. Prints come in frames made of driftwood by a man who gathers the wood by canoe in Key West, Fla. With each vignette, ''the child has an opportunity to make his or her own story,'' Ms. Nicholas Williams said. Her own son ''lets it be known what I should add or take away. I was working on a picture of a rabbit sleeping underground beneath a garden, and Tavo told me: 'You really need a door. How else will she get in?' '' ''Radish Moon'' limited-edition prints; $250.

But that would no doubt come as a compliment to Bless, Boudicca and Sandra Backlund, the unconventional and fiercely independent designers who were selected by the show's curator, Zoë Ryan, because their work ''challenges the fashion system and speaks to the time in which it is made.'' Three immersive environments highlight behind-the-scenes aspects of the creative process. The Boudicca designers Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby have provided 25 to 30 of their conceptual short films. The Bless component will feature Desiree Heiss and Ines Kaag's signature look books - using friends as models and distributed in publications like Monthly Vampire Magazine - and surreal hybrid objects like the ''Hairbrush.'' And Backlund will be represented by light-infused abstractions of her sculptural, handmade knits printed on 11-foot scrims, which underscore her emotional connection to her work. Says Ryan: ''I'm curious to see what people will make of it.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

''It is really about letting go, being wild and creating a space that someone can be free in,'' said Ms. Bird, pictured above with some of the women who model in the book (from left, Diane Russo, Cherlyn Russo, Julia Res, Ms. Bird and Khara Gilvey).

I would be in a wheelchair, too weak to walk. In Paris, the doctors had struggled to make sense of my symptoms - anemia, fatigue and persistent infections. They ran test after test - I was even hospitalized for a week - but the results were inconclusive. I was just 22, but the doctors released me with a diagnosis of ''burnout syndrome'' and orders to rest for a month."

The six remaining contestants get clothes to fit their slimmer waistlines when the fashion professional Jeannie Mai and the stylist Ken Paves join the show in this makeover episode. All dressed up, the contestants just need somewhere to go. That problem is solved when they receive an invitation to visit the White House and meet with the first lady, Michelle Obama. The contestants travel to Washington, where they reunite with their families and show the payoff from their hard work. In the second part of the episode, appearing next week, Mrs. Obama works out with them and discusses the benefits of an active lifestyle. Above, a scene from the show. 10:15 A.M.

But then he falls for one of his colleagues at work, the bright and self-possessed Asha (Ayesha Dharker), and he learns to embrace India and recognize the benefits of change. Reviewing this movie for The New York Times, Matt Zoller Seitz called it ''a wonderful surprise'' and said ''the filmmakers treat Todd's story as a springboard for a smart look at the effect of cultural difference on work, friendship and love, and the global economy's impact on national and personal identity.''"

Lupus Foundation and the lupus patient and scientific communities across the nation mourn the death of our Foundation's beloved founder Morrie Golick (1911-2012) at the age of 101. Born of a father's love, the S.L.E. Lupus Foundation was forged by his devotion to his daughter Susan and his determination to find answers when she was diagnosed at 24 with the devastating autoimmune disease lupus. Celebrating the Foundation's 40th anniversary and his 100th birthday in 2010, Morrie reflected, ""I wanted to find a way others could benefit from our family's difficult experience with lupus."" Morrie Golick made the difference for lupus patients, families, researchers and physicians, launching the lupus movement in New York City and leading its evolution across America. He and Susan worked tirelessly to create much-needed patient services, awareness and advocacy, while always supporting lupus research. Their leadership in nurturing promising scientists and building the laboratories of New York helped their city become the world's foremost center for lupus care and research. Convinced that a cure is within reach, Morrie worked to create the Lupus Research Institute in 2000, now the world's leading supporter of innovative research in lupus. Because of that steadfast conviction, Morrie saw many pivotal scientific discoveries, including the first lupus treatment in 50 years, come to fruition during his lifetime. Morrie Golick has given us a lasting legacy - generosity of spirit, a loving heart that went out to all who struggle with this disease every day, and the unflagging determination to pursue a cure for lupus. We honor and remember Morrie with love and will miss him very much."

2012-04-04T00:00:00Z,"HERRMANN--Edmund. Edmund Herrmann passed away on Thursday, March 29, 2012, at Mease Continuing Care in Dunedin, Florida. He was 94. Ed was born in Brooklyn, NY and lived in Mount Vernon, NY for many years where he raised his family with his first wife, the former Beatrice Wertheim. He married Janis G. Thomas in 1976. They retired to Dunedin, FL in 1992. Janis died in 2003. Ed worked as a compositor for The New York Times at its Times Square, New York facility and retired in 1983, just as computers were starting to make his profession obsolete. Besides being a member of The New York Times Credit Union Board, when not at work, he volunteered his time and energies to local organizations. As a member of the Ethical Culture Society of Westchester (NY), Ed provided administrative and leadership support to the Society's outreach programs. After working with Boy Scout groups for many years, Ed became the Scoutmaster for a troop that was organized in a local orphanage in Mount Vernon. As a volunteer with the Visiting Nurse Services in Westchester, Inc., Ed began what would be many years of Hospice service in both Westchester County, NY and then Pinellas County, FL with Suncoast Hospice. Ed's fifteen plus years of volunteer work with the City of Dunedin Library system resulted in a public citation and Certificate of Appreciation presented by the mayor. As a life insurance salesman in the 1950's, Ed saw a lot of the country by car and train. He also had worked in New York City as a counselor with the Jewish War Veterans. Ed was a 1st Lieutenant in U.S. Army during WWII. Before suffering from a series of debilitating strokes that restricted his mobility, Ed attended weekly services with the Unitarian Universalists of Clearwater; enjoyed traveling by cruise ship with Janis; and hosted weekly meetings in Dunedin's Hale Senior Activity Center where current affairs would be discussed. As an avid reader, he would always have a book within reach as well as the daily New York Times. Survivors include a daughter Judy; sons Barry, Jeffrey and Walter; stepdaughter Susan Thomas and stepson Peter Thomas; and grandchildren Mico Hassert, Beth Herrmann, Joshua Herrmann, Jason Thomas and Ryan Thomas. A Memorial Service is not planned. Contributions, if desired, may be made in Ed's memory to a favorite charity."

The three-day event, the Firefly Music Festival, is scheduled for July 20 to 22 at the Woodlands of Dover International Speedway. Organizers say more than 40 bands and solo artists will play, ranging from the R&B singer John Legend to the indie band Death Cab for Cutie. The rappers Tinie Tempah and Lupe Fiasco are also expected to perform. The festival is being produced by Red Frog Events, a five-year-old Chicago company that has had success promoting extreme foot races under the name Warrior Dash, as well as pub crawls, but has never put together a large music event. Meghan Roman, a spokeswoman for the company, said the vision of the owners -- Joe Reynolds and Ryan Kunkel -- was an open-air festival on the East Coast with plenty of outdoor camping, much like the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee. A three-day pass costs $178. Attractions will include an air-conditioned brewery, a wine garden and hot-air balloon rides above the speedway, she said."

Sean Penn is a federal agent sent to protect her and investigate.

Morrie Golick made the difference for lupus patients, families, researchers and physicians, launching the lupus movement in New York City and leading its evolution across America. He and Susan worked tirelessly to create much-needed patient services, awareness and advocacy, while always supporting lupus research. Their leadership in nurturing promising scientists and building the laboratories of New York helped their city become the world's foremost center for lupus care and research. Convinced that a cure is within reach, Morrie worked to create the Lupus Research Institute in 2000, now the world's leading supporter of innovative research in lupus. Because of that steadfast conviction, Morrie saw many pivotal scientific discoveries, including the first lupus treatment in 50 years, come to fruition during his lifetime. Morrie Golick has given us a lasting legacy - generosity of spirit, a loving heart that went out to all who struggle with this disease every day, and the unflagging determination to pursue a cure for lupus. We honor and remember Morrie with love and will miss him very much."

This desert-hue print from Gretchen Jones, the fairly innocuous ''Project Runway'' winner from Season 8, mashes up a medley of inspirations: Patti Smith's ''Horses'' album; Castaneda's ''Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge''; and Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome. ''The result was this kaleidoscopic horse stampede,'' Ms. Jones said. However she got there, the print is eye-catching, and this silk shirt or skirt, worn with denim, would put a new spin on country chic.

I don't want to say they are slow, but it's just not the same Augusta. It's wet around the greens, and there's no fear of the course. You've got to attack it this week.

He lived in Neuilly initially and then in Manhattan for the rest of his life. He was the son of the late Frederic and Julia Goldschmidt Lunzer of Vienna, both noted artists who regarded their brilliant son as the most talented of their family of three. He is survived by the love of his life, his wife of 27 years, Lynn Torgerson of Manhattan. He also leaves behind his dearly beloved cats, Buddy and Slinky. Francis was impeccably educated formally at Horace Mann Prep School followed by Columbia College, but was an autodidact of astonishing scope. His musical ability, both as a drummer from which he made a living, and the piano was innate. He was supremely musical, possessing a keen ear and solid sense of rhythm. He was deeply erudite on a broad range of subjects with deep wells of knowledge of jazz, automobiles, fine art, literature, superior cuisine, in addition to being a scholar of the Second World War and the Holocaust. He amassed an immense and rare group of collections of African art, books, classic scale model cars, and all manner of notable objets d'art. His collection of true friends was equally as impressive. Francis was a polymath of the highest order. One's initial impression upon meeting Francis was the realization that one was in the presence of a man of fierce wit and an easy, wicked sense of humor. He was fully engaged with his life, savoring every moment. His memory will live long in the hearts of all who knew and loved him.

Well, I'd like to see Paul Weller or Jimmy Jam put that to the test. Advertising aside, Fellowes's newest consumer model does address some practical issues. Start with that jam-proof technology: What the 79Ci does is try to head off a jam before it happens. It accomplishes this by measuring how much paper is being inserted before it cranks up its jaws of death. If you try to pull a Full Enron (that's shredder-speak for overloading the machine), a green-to-yellow-to-red indicator will tell you if you've exceeded the shredder's capacity, requiring you to reload in more moderate amounts."

That comedy tells the story of Brian Cohen, a young Jewish man born on the same day and in the next stable as Jesus who spends his life being mistaken for the Messiah. A dramatization of the debate, ''Circus,'' directed by Owen Harris and written by Tony Roche, chronicles the build-up to the face-off and the controversy surrounding ''Brian,'' which resulted in nuns and rabbis picketing movie theaters and some British authorities, as well as countries like Ireland and Norway, banning it outright. The cast is rounded out by Rufus Jones as Terry Jones, Tom Fisher as Graham Chapman, Phil Nichol as Terry Gilliam, Ben Crispin as Jesus and Stephen Fry as God.

His fascination with the murals slathered on the walls of the abandoned buildings on the neighborhood's post-industrial waterfront satisfied his longing for adventure, looking like tags written by phantom giants.

He got that soon enough when he started writing and warning against the influx of artists and other trendsetters who were slowly colonizing the area in the early 1990s. Where others saw a brick and mortar change for the better, Mr. Farr was alarmed that these newcomers would push out members of the area's long-established Puerto Rican community."

Born in Berlin, Ms. Hertling exudes reserve and discretion (though usually not in the eye makeup department), perhaps exaggerated by the fact that she is a practicing restitution lawyer. What ties it all together, loosely enough, is that she moonlights as a curator.

2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"A French-cuffed shirt requires cuff links; it seems pretty obvious to me now. However, 10 years ago, when I first removed the pins and packaging from a dress shirt and threaded my arms through the sleeves, I was that most hapless class of human being -- a college intern. It was my first morning in New York; I had just woken up on my friend Dan's couch in Murray Hill; and I had one hour to go before the scheduled start of my professional life. I was to be an investment banker, if I could just get dressed. The bank's dress code was business casual. I figured that meant something sharp, like a pair of Dockers. Or since I didn't own any khakis, how about my tan, five-pocket corduroys? One of the belt loops had come loose, and yes, the cuffs had begun to fray. But these were not jeans and thus were dress pants, perfectly acceptable for Sunday church back in Iowa and therefore equally appropriate for one of Manhattan's revered financial institutions. Dan had already left for work, or else, presumably, he would have questioned some aspects of this logic."

Sandra is survived by her son, Gerald Seroy, her grandchildren Jack and Lila Seroy and her husband Frank Crivello. Over the span of a forty-six year career in the fashion industry, Sandra worked together with her late husband Michael, to build the Michael Seroy label. Then starting in the early nineties she went on to become a top U.S. senior executive for a number of leading European fashion brands such as Max Mara, Genny, Gianfranco Ferre and Brioni. She was highly recruited by European fashion houses for her incredible knowledge of the U.S. market and her relationships with the top executives at the largest retailers. Her accomplishments are matched by the wonderful friends, family and business colleagues that she leaves behind and will never forget her.

2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"ARE alarm bells going off at the 59E59 Theaters? They should be, since the playwright David Harrower has left a man and a woman alone on a stage there. The last time Mr. Harrower did this, in his Olivier Award-winning ''Blackbird'' (staged by the Manhattan Theater Club in 2007), the chemistry between his characters was so toxic that many of us who saw it still feel the burn. His current offering, opening on Thursday, has the ominous title ''A SLOW AIR.'' It is ostensibly a portrait of a relationship between a long-estranged brother and sister, played by Lewis Howden and Susan Vidler. But the play's scope turns out to range far beyond matters domestic. (The 2007 terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport is a fulcrum of the plot.) Mr. Harrower has referred to ''A Slow Air'' as ''a Scotland play,'' which considers ''how the certainties with which people grew up have been challenged.'' The production is part of 59E59 Theaters' Scotland Week celebration, which also includes Gerda Stevenson's ''Federer Versus Murray.'' (And it is not, for the record, exclusively about tennis.) 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org; $35 (''A Slow Air'') and $25 (''Federer versus Murray'')."

I think people are doubly hostile to pop-music snobbery because there's something elemental to our lives about music that makes it easier to be defensive if someone knows more about it than you do, particularly if it's something you like. I've definitely felt the anguish of looking like a rube next to someone more knowledgeable about something I like, and the initial reaction can be anger and rejection.

''Accelerando'' (ACT), released last month, takes that preoccupation to its logical extreme: the album is about how music articulates human motion. That might sound like an academic premise -- and it has been, for the band's namesake pianist. But this isn't chin-stroking music; its aim and effect are visceral. Mr. Iyer has a percussive attack at the piano, along with a habit of digging in, kneading the keys. Stephan Crump lays a strong undertow on bass, his notes ringing purposefully plump. And Marcus Gilmore uses his drums and cymbals ingeniously, swarming the beat while laying back. He's one of the most excitingly kinetic drummers in jazz, and this is his best outlet so far. ''Accelerando'' came about after extensive touring in support of ''Historicity,'' the trio's previous album on the same label."

He was tended lovingly throughout his illness by his beloved wife Soony. He is survived by his brother Howard and his family. A memorial service will be held at 3:30pm on Sunday, April 22, 2012 at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue (81st Street). Born in the Bronx, NY on October 18, 1932, he graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science in 1948, the University of Pennsylvania in 1953, and the New York University School of Medicine in 1957. He was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Board of Cardiovascular Disease. From 1959 to 1961, he served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force in Evreux France, where he honed a taste for gourmet food and fine wines. After leaving the Air Force, he was closely associated with Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, initially as director of geriatric medicine at the Gouverneur Clinic from 1966 to 1972. Gouverneur, on the Lower East Side, where Beth Israel had its origins, was a renowned and innovative clinic. He mentored scores of health professionals in that setting, providing a unique and humane practice of health care delivery to the poor and underserved. In 1978, he initiated a private practice of internal medicine and cardiology at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street. Participating fully in the cultural life of New York's theater, music and arts, the Grossmans also traveled extensively in the United States, Asia, Europe and Africa. Will was an accomplished photographer and birder, and he often made these activities the center of their travels. Over the years, he acquired a notable collection of U.S. duck decoy and shore bird carvings and was well recognized at Eastern shore auctions as a knowledgeable and perceptive collector. The gentle art of good listening made him a beloved friend and companion and enhanced his skills as a physician. He was a devoted husband and loving friend, a man with a great zest for life, a gift for friendship and a compassionate and caring nature. Beloved by colleagues and friends, his true genius showed in his relationship with his patients. He instilled in them a remarkable level of confidence and trust inspired by his warmth, compassion, attentiveness and wisdom. Scores of colleagues, friends, and patients made their way to the Grossman home over the course of his illness to pay him tribute. People of widely diverse backgrounds including notables like Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Milton Glaser, the celebrated and pre-eminent graphics designer, and Dr. Howard Gray, renowned immunologist and president of the Scripps Institute of La Jolla came to praise a good man. In this day of hyperbole, Will Grossman was the essence of goodness. He will be sorely missed by the multitude of friends, patients and colleagues whose lives he touched deeply. May his name be a blessing for us all."

And given airport procedures, flying isn't such a shortcut. Surf Air (surfair.com), an airline starting this summer, has designs on that short-haul sweet spot. Its concept: eight-seater, first-class planes fly daily loops through uncongested regional airports (inaugural route: Van Nuys-Palo Alto-Monterey/Pebble Beach-Santa Barbara). For a $3,000 membership fee during the initial three-month trial -- and for up to $1,500 each month thereafter -- members can fly as many times as they wish along that route, subject to availability. They can drive to the airport, hand their car keys to a valet, wheel their bags up to the pilot, and board."

2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Things that might have happened long ago and far away come back to happen here and now in ''LAST TOUCH FIRST,'' by Jiri Kylian, the Czech-born former director of Nederlands Dans Theater, and Michael Schumacher, an American dancer based in Europe. They might even have called it ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' except for the stumbling block of Proust. Even so, this hourlong 2008 creation does evoke a sense of vanished times. The setting is a manor-house drawing room with furniture shrouded by immense dust covers; the lighting is sepia toned, as if to evoke old photographs; and the performers might well be ghosts, dancing to a score by the German composer Dirk P. Haubrich that includes sounds of a seemingly far-off piano. Everyone moves with unusual slowness, when they move at all. But this near motionlessness is occasionally broken by sudden acts suggesting that emotions still survive in these specters, passions that can haunt the present. 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 p.m. on April 15, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $39."
2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"When last we saw Showtime's blond bombshells of a certain age -- Jackie Peyton, the self-medicating emergency room nurse portrayed by Edie Falco in ''NURSE JACKIE,'' and Cathy Jamison, the cancer patient played by Laura Linney in ''THE BIG C'' -- they were discovering that what goes around comes around. As the seasons wrapped, Cathy confronted not her own mortality but rather that of her husband, Paul (Oliver Platt); she crossed the finish line of a marathon just as he succumbed to a heart attack. And the philandering, pill-popping Jackie sent her spouse, Kevin (Dominic Fumusa), packing after he confessed to having an affair. On Sunday at 9 ''Nurse Jackie'' will admit its tart-tongued protagonist into rehab when a drug-fueled encounter with a stranger results in his death. And at 9:30 ''The Big C'' will begin a new round of gallows humor, as Cathy downs her third martini at a bar and christens the drink a Thirsty Widow. The plot twists could lead to another Emmy Award face-off this year between the consistently stellar Ms. Falco and Ms. Linney -- and prove to women everywhere that 40-something doesn't have to be the new anything. When embodied by these actresses the number is pretty terrific on its own merits."

2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"SOMETIMES, though not often, there is immediate chemistry between a conductor and the players of a major orchestra. This happened when the wiry, kinetic Dutch conductor JAAP VAN ZWEDEN first conducted the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 2006. Soon afterward the organization courted him as music director, and Mr. van Zweden began his tenure there in 2008. He was impressive, if not a knockout, in a 2009 program I heard in Dallas that season. From all reports the musicians and the community are fully behind him. It will be interesting to see if chemistry ignites when Mr. van Zweden makes his debut with the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC this week. The unadventurous program offers familiar pieces, with the Mahler First as the main work. Prokofiev's exciting Piano Concerto No. 3 features the dazzling young Chinese pianist Yuja Wang.

2012-04-08T00:00:00Z,"AFTER the success of its one-night-only presentation of the singer-artist Antony Hegarty at Radio City Music Hall, the Museum of Modern Art offers an eight-day-only retrospective of the German group KRAFTWERK, starting Tuesday. Kraftwerk -- ''powers station'' in German -- began as a two-man project in Düsseldorf in 1970. Its creators, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider, working with multitrack tapes, synthesizers and, increasingly, with digital technology, composed scores that sounded at once spacey and robotic, and had a big impact on early electronic dance music and hip-hop. In the past decade the group has complemented its act with extravagant sets and videos, making it a natural candidate for the museum's current performance art initiative. Over the eight nights, inside the museum itself, the group will cover what is advertised as its complete repertory, from 1974 through 2003. Could it be that the Modern's relentlessly maligned atrium will finally have found its proper use, as a kind of intergalactic sound-and-light machine? Tuesday through April 17, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; sold out. (An exhibition of Kraftwerk audio and visual material is on view at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens, April 12 to May 14.)"

Boehner, many liberals have reacted with shock and horror at how much of their historic achievement the president appears to have been ready to bargain away. If a Democratic president could consider cutting America's shredded safety net further when unemployment remained stiffly high and the country was undergoing an explosion of inequality, was the ''liberal moment'' of American politics finally over? Yet Maryland recently became the eighth state to join the same-sex marriage club (which includes the District of Columbia). Rush Limbaugh was force-fed a triple helping of crow for his failed attempt at ''slut shaming,'' after opening up the gender gap again.

The Titanic - the largest passenger ship the world had seen, and the most unbelievably and unapologetically opulent - was an event before it was an event, and New York had read all about it in progress reports on the positioning of the stern frame, in accounts of its launching and in short paragraphs about brief test runs. And then, as it left Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage, it yanked the New York, which was alongside it at the pier, from its moorings."

(13, 49) BEING ELMO: A PUPPETEER'S JOURNEY (2011) As a teenager in Baltimore in the 1970s Kevin Clash had a singular wish: to be a puppeteer on the team of Jim Henson, the creative force behind ''Sesame Street'' and the Muppets. Mr. Clash's dream eventually came true when he attracted the attention of the Muppet designer Kermit Love. And then one day the veteran puppeteer Richard Hunt tossed a furry red monster at him in a fit of frustration, unable to find the character's voice. Mr. Clash eventually did, and Elmo (above, with Mr. Clash), one of the world's most beloved characters, was born. ''Independent Lens'' presents this documentary, directed by Constance Marks and narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, which Neil Genzlinger, writing in The New York Times, called ''a winning tale of the persistence and creativity behind one of the most famous and fuzziest faces in the world.'' 8 P.M.

He was awarded three battle stars in the European Theater of Operations and the Bronze Star. He was entitled to wear the Distinguished Unit Citation. He received a degree in Fine Arts from Wesleyan University and studied at the University of Tulsa, The University of Houston and New York University. Pursuing an interest in photography Jack freelanced for national magazines including LIFE. In the 1950's Jack was a member of The Independent Filmmakers in New York. His short film ""A Poem of Life"" of a sculpture by Aristede Maillot is in the Permanent Collection of the Library of Congress. Working in film and television in New York and California he photographed and directed documentaries and television films. For his work in the field he received several industry awards including the Sylvania Award for Creative Television Technique. Subsequently he founded a private company to explore for oil and natural gas in the US. A descendant of Huguenot refugees who settled in New Rochelle in 1687, Jack established a nonprofit organization Huguenot Heritage to research and to inform the public about cultural, scientific, technical and artistic contributions of the descendents of the Huguenots. He was most pleased with a project to preserve the beautiful but neglected Chateau Chamerolles in Loiret, France, a place of unique Huguenot history. An early marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Suzanne Lightbourn, and two granddaughters. He was member of numerous societies dedicated to history, the fine arts and film. Jack was man of great intelligence, intellectual curiosity and integrity and his wry wit will be missed. A memorial gathering is being planned."

Adored wife of Herbert Owens for more than 68 years, beloved mother of Bob [Evie], Ruth, Mark [Mindy] and sister of Ilse. Cherished grandmother and great-grandmother. Raised in Vienna, Austria from her birth in 1924 until the Nazi occupation in 1938, she and her immediate family fled to safety in Albania with the help of its righteous Muslim ruler, King Zog I. After a year in Tirana, Fritzi and her family arrived in New York to start her new life as an American high school student the only woman in her class at the School of Industrial Arts. After graduation, she joined her parents at Weitzmann Photo Studio which they had re-established in New York. Later, Fritzi was the first female volunteer in the Photography Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for 25 year. She also served as a volunteer for more than 10 years at the International Foundation of Art Research. She loved attending operas, concerts, and the theater; and spending time with her family.

2012-04-10T00:00:00Z,"About 28 million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been ''continuous positive airway pressure.'' A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea. But the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks. ''For a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,'' said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. ''C.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there's a good chance they won't use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.''"
2012-04-10T00:00:00Z,"The start of April school vacations led some Broadway producers to charge high premium prices for more seats last week because of family and tourist demand, and as a result several of the shows - ''Wicked,'' ''The Lion King,'' ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' and ''The Book of Mormon'' - brought in huge sums per person on average, according to weekly box office data published on Monday. For instance ''The Lion King'' had an average paid admission of $155.09 even though its regular top ticket price was $133. This was possible because Disney Theatrical Productions charged as much as $197.50 for the best seats in the theater. ''The Book of Mormon'' was even more aggressive in its ticket pricing: The musical had an average paid admission of $181.70 last week. Its regular top price was $155, but the ''Mormon'' producers charged as much as $477 for some of the best seats. As a result ''Mormon'' set a new box office record at the Eugene O'Neill Theater of $1,590,235."

(Discovery) DEADLIEST CATCH The series celebrates its 100th episode with this Season 8 premiere as the captains -- Andy Hillstrand and Johnathan Hillstrand of the Time Bandit, Sig Hansen of the Northwestern, Keith Colburn of the Wizard, Bill Wichrowski of the Kodiak, Scott Campbell Jr. of the Seabrooke (above) and Elliott Neese of the Ramblin' Rose -- once again journey into the Bering Sea for Alaskan king crab. But with fishing quotas slashed by nearly half, the men face tough decisions about how to make enough money to keep their businesses afloat amid some of the harshest weather in nearly 25 years. 12:05 P.M. (HBO Signature) CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) When the mistress (Anjelica Huston) of Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau, in an Oscar-nominated performance), a Manhattan ophthalmologist, threatens to go public with their affair and his unethical financial dealings, he hires his mobster brother (Jerry Orbach) to kill her. In this movie from Woody Allen, who received best director and best screenplay nominations, Mr. Allen plays Cliff Stern, a married documentarian infatuated with another woman (Mia Farrow). Sam Waterston is Judah's best friend, a rabbi; Alan Alda is a successful television producer and Cliff's brother-in-law. ''The wonder of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' is the facility with which Mr. Allen deals with so many interlocking stories of so many differing tones and voices,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. ''The film cuts back and forth between parallel incidents and between present and past with the effortlessness of a hip, contemporary Aesop.''"

2012-04-10T00:00:00Z,"A large new study has ruled out concerns that children over 4 are at greater risk of seizures after getting a common measles-containing vaccine called MMRV. The vaccine -- which combines the shot for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, with the vaccine for varicella, or chickenpox -- is given to children in two steps, first as toddlers and then again between ages 4 and 6. Concerns were raised several years ago after scientists found that 1-year-old children who were given the MMRV vaccine had double the risk of a febrile seizure, a brief convulsion triggered by a fever, compared with those who were given the MMR and chickenpox shots separately but on the same day. Febrile seizures, which can also be set off by ear infections, colds and other viral illnesses, strike about 5 percent of children younger than 5 and are particularly common in toddlers. Although they are alarming to parents, they do not cause any long-term problems."

Yet she has given few performances in the United States. This recital, with the American pianist Donald Sulzen, was her first appearance in New York since her debut here in an early-music program at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1999. At the end, along with all the ''bravas'' from the audience, I wanted to shout, ''Where have you been?''"

Years later one would end up in the headlines, and in jail, for murder. But on April 15, 1912, the two editors - Carr V. Van Anda, the managing editor of The New York Times, and Charles E. Chapin, the city editor of The New York Evening World - just wanted the facts."
2012-04-10T00:00:00Z,"More than 40 million women are the primary caregivers for a sick person, very often the man they are married to. Caregiving, after all, is a wife's expected role, and most accept it perforce as a duty that offers precious time to express love and wishes, settle financial and legal matters, and right past wrongs.

2012-04-10T00:00:00Z,"PARDO--Stanley Thomas, of Montclair, New Jersey, passed away after a long illness on Saturday, April 7, 2012 at 3:40pm. He was 76 years old and had lived life with gusto and enthusiasm. He was born on November 22, 1935 in Jersey City, New Jersey. Stanley graduated as valedictorian of his class from St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City in 1953. He then went on to Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., on a Navy scholarship as part of the US Navy ROTC program, earning an A.B. with Honors in History & Philosophy in the Honors Course in 1957. Born with a gift for language and expression, Stan effortlessly won debating competitions while at Holy Cross and continued to be through later life an adept writer and public speaker. In 1958, he entered active duty as an ensign with the US Navy. He served on the USS Canberra, one of the first guided missile cruisers, as a member of the staff of the Commander Cruiser Force of the Atlantic Fleet, circumnavigating the globe and twice crossing the Equator at the international dateline. He was released from active service in 1961 with the rank of Lieutenant and joined the Naval Reserve. He ultimately retired from the Reserve in 1995 with the rank of Commander. He married Mary Alyce in June of 1962, and earned his L.L.B. from the Columbia University School of Law in 1963. He practiced law from 1963 to 1971 as an associate attorney in the corporate department of Breed, Abbott & Morgan, a major New York City law firm. In 1971, he left the practice of law and spent the remainder of his professional career in investment banking, initially joining Eastman Dillon, Union Securities & Co. as Vice President of Public Finance. Four years later, he was appointed Executive Vice President of the Municipal Bond division of the merged Blyth Eastman Dillon & Co. in charge of public finance, municipal bond underwriting, trading and sales. He also served as a Director of that firm and converted Eastman Dillon from a niche player in industrial revenue bond financing to top rankings in all important areas of public finance at that time: public power, housing, healthcare, pollution control, transportation and corporate-related issuances. In 1980, he was named Managing Director in charge of the Public Finance Department of Blyth Eastman PaineWebber, and in 1983 Chairman of the Municipal Securities Group management Committee at PaineWebber. In 1985, he joined Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. as Managing Director of the Public Finance Department. Stanley pioneered many of what later became standard state housing revenue bond programs in the single-family, multifamily, and home improvement areas. He served on the Public Securities Association as a member of the Public Finance, Membership and Tax Reform committees. He was a member of the Municipal committee of the Securities Industry Association, also serving as that association's chairman for a term during the 1980s. From 1991, during semi-retirement, he worked as a consultant to Ring, McAfee & Company Inc. in the areas of project finance and merchant banking. Stan and Mary Alyce owned a summer home in Nantucket, Mass., and with their children enjoyed the beauty and serenity of summers there. Stan loved to travel and took every opportunity to do so. He was a devoted Catholic and gave much of his time to active participation in his parish at Immaculate Conception Church, including teaching in the CCD program for many years. Stan loved to have a good time, and shared many late night revelries with friends. He was a maverick who nonetheless succeeded in the system. He was opinionated but also a peacemaker. He bore the burdens of his long illness without complaints or self-pity. He appreciated music and loved to dance. He leaves behind his wife of 50 years, Mary Alyce, and four devoted children: Georgiana M. Pardo of Charles Town, West Virginia, Helaine G. Utzinger and her spouse Henry of Wayne, New Jersey, Thomas S. Pardo, his spouse Johanna, their child, Nicholas S. Pardo, all of Maplewood, New Jersey, and Alyson A. Pardo of Montclair, New Jersey. He also leaves behind his brother Joseph A. Pardo of Philomont, Virginia, his sister Mary Ann Pardo of Holly Spring, North Carolina, and his sister Patricia Walker of Middleburg, Virginia. A wake will be held on Wednesday, April 11 at 2:00 to 4:00pm and 7:00 to 9:00pm at the Moriarty Funeral Home, 76 Park Street, Montclair, NJ, and a funeral mass will be celebrated on Thursday, April 12 at 9:40am at Immaculate Conception Church, 30 North Fullerton Ave., Montclair, NJ. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made in his memory to St. Peter's Preparatory School, 144 Grand St., Jersey City, NJ 07302 or www.stpetersprep.org, or to the Resurrection School, 189 Brunswick St., Jersey City, NJ 07302 or www.resurrectionschooljcnj.org"

Adored wife of Herbert Owens for more than 68 years, beloved mother of Bob [Evie], Ruth, Mark [Mindy] and sister of Ilse. Cherished grandmother and great-grandmother. Raised in Vienna, Austria from her birth in 1924 until the Nazi occupation in 1938, she and her immediate family fled to safety in Albania with the help of its righteous Muslim ruler, King Zog I. After a year in Tirana, Fritzi and her family arrived in New York to start her new life as an American high school student the only woman in her class at the School of Industrial Arts. After graduation, she joined her parents at Weitzmann Photo Studio which they had re-established in New York. Later, Fritzi was the first female volunteer in the Photography Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for 25 year. She also served as a volunteer for more than 10 years at the International Foundation of Art Research. She loved attending operas, concerts, and the theater; and spending time with her family. For the past 16 years, she had courageously fought cancer, not allowing her illnesses to slow her down. Her amazingly rich life and marriage have now come to an end. We are heartbroken to be observing Passover without her and her renowned gefilte fish. The private graveside service was held on Sunday morning.

He received a degree in Fine Arts from Wesleyan University and studied at the University of Tulsa, The University of Houston and New York University. Pursuing an interest in photography Jack freelanced for national magazines including LIFE. In the 1950's Jack was a member of The Independent Filmmakers in New York.

Working in film and television in New York and California he photographed and directed documentaries and television films. For his work in the field he received several industry awards including the Sylvania Award for Creative Television Technique. Subsequently he founded a private company to explore for oil and natural gas in the US. A descendant of Huguenot refugees who settled in New Rochelle in 1687, Jack established a nonprofit organization Huguenot Heritage to research and to inform the public about cultural, scientific, technical and artistic contributions of the descendents of the Huguenots. He was most pleased with a project to preserve the beautiful but neglected Chateau Chamerolles in Loiret, France, a place of unique Huguenot history. An early marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Suzanne Lightbourn, and two granddaughters. He was member of numerous societies dedicated to history, the fine arts and film. Jack was man of great intelligence, intellectual curiosity and integrity and his wry wit will be missed. A memorial gathering is being planned."

HBO said on Tuesday that it was ordering another year of ''Game of Thrones,'' its fantasy drama about the warring clans of Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Greyjoys and Targaryen (among other unusual permutations of vowels and consonants) on the mythical continent of Westeros. The series, which is adapted from George R. R. Martin's best-selling ''Song of Ice and Fire'' novels and produced by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, was a breakout hit in its first season, earning an Emmy nomination for best dramatic series and winning an Emmy and a Golden Globe for its star Peter Dinklage, who plays the manipulative Tyrion Lannister. Season 2, which began on April 1, is already off to a strong start, drawing nearly 4 million viewers for the debut broadcasts of each episode that have been shown so far. Dates for the production and premiere of Season 3 of ''Game of Thrones'' were not announced but should occur some time after Daenerys Targaryen crosses the Red Waste. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Since the current playoff format was adopted 17 seasons ago, there have been 68 series matching the No. 1 seed in a conference against the No. 8 seed, and No. 2 versus No. 7. Of those 68 series, 23 have ended in victory for the underdog."

Mr. Paul was visiting Texas A & M University as part of a three-day swing through the state, which also included stops in Fort Worth and San Antonio. And showing how much the campaign is focused on collecting delegates in Texas, it produced a video before Mr. Santorum's suspension that employs a Texas twang to take swipes at Mr. Santorum (labeling him a ''big-spending, debt-ceiling-raising fiscal liberal''), Newt Gingrich (''the moon colony guy'') and Mitt Romney (''the moderate from Massachusetts'')."

2012-04-11T00:00:00Z,"When the Mets play the Nationals on Wednesday in the final game of their three-game series, fans will not only see a marquee matchup between Johan Santana and Stephen Strasburg, but also get to see a slice of history at a bargain-basement price. Roger Craig, the starting pitcher in the Mets' first regular-season game in 1962, will throw out the first pitch Wednesday, which occurred 50 years ago on that date. The Mets lost that game to the Cardinals in St. Louis, and Craig, now 82, went on to lose 24 games in 1962 and 22 more games in 1963. But his good cheer in the face of his hard luck became emblematic of those Mets teams."

2012-04-11T00:00:00Z,"With the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Rolling Stones fast approaching, speculation about what the band might or might not do to commemorate the date continues. The guitarist Ronnie Wood offered some tantalizing hints on Monday, saying that the group would go into a recording studio later this month ''to just bat some ideas around'' and ''get the feel again.'' Mr. Wood, who joined the Stones in 1975 after the departure of Mick Taylor, spoke to reporters at a news conference in New York at the opening of an exhibition of his paintings, ''Faces, Time and Places.'' Mr. Wood is the junior member of the band, and his opinions carry less weight than those of Mick Jagger or Keith Richards, who have traditionally supplied the group's material and direction, but in the context of the Stones' complicated internal politics Mr. Wood is close to Mr. Richards and often shares his views."

All of us at Jazz at Lincoln Center loved Phoebe Jacobs. We loved her feisty outspoken spirit, we loved her New York accent and style, we loved to listen to her talk about the past and her deep friendships with Louis Armstrong and so many other jazz greats, and we loved her optimism and her bright clear gaze always fixed on the next horizon and on the future. More than anything, we loved Phoebe Jacobs because she embodied the very essence and the heart and soul of America's greatest art form, jazz. She talked jazz, she swung jazz, she ate jazz, she danced jazz, and she lived the past and future of jazz. She was her own second line and wherever she was, the language, sound, taste and smell of our music - jazz - was always there. Almost from the very beginning of Jazz at Lincoln Center she was one of our brightest guardian angels. Phoebe and the Louis Armstrong Foundation, which she chaired and vice chaired, were there to guide, fund and challenge us to do more to spread the good news about jazz and its unique position in the story of America and American culture. The millions of dollars from the Louis Armstrong Foundation were essential to our growth and recognized success but even more important was the special gift Phoebe gave to us: the gift of herself with her warm, wonderful, honest personality. Her deep devotion and belief in the importance of this music helped us create so many programs which will influence generations of children to love jazz as she did and recognize its powerful message of making the world a warmer, more democratic and soulful place. We loved Phoebe dearly and will miss her and the sparkle she radiated whenever she entered our House of Swing. We send our deepest sympathy to her children and grandchildren.

Phil was a major fundraiser for Jewish causes including UJA, Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem as well as an advocate for accessible health care supporting the American Lung Association and RotaCare both of which he was honored by for his work. Even more, and perhaps most importantly, Phil never ignored the needs of his patients and was known to provide medical care to his neediest of patients free of charge or in exchange for some home cooked food! Phil's love of travel took him all over the world, where he could continue to soak up and learn about everything from Italian food and Jewish antiquities to Parisian art and German opera. It was these trips that he was blessed to share with Rovena and regales his family with stories upon his return. One of Phil's proudest achievements was his family who loved him immensely. Affectionately known as Pop-Phil, he spent much of his free time with his children and grandchildren, often hosting big family dinners that were filled with a lot of energy and laughter. In addition to being survived by his wife Rovena of Jericho; Phil is also survived by his in-laws and surrogate parents Morton and Harriet Shreck; sons: Mitch husband of Sarah Marcus of Forest Hills, Brian husband of Faith Marcus of New York City, a daughter Alyssa wife of Gary Klein of Harrisburg Pennsylvania; and grandchildren, Max Marcus, Luke Marcus, Julia Klein, Jake Marcus, Jenna Klein and Liam Philip Marcus."

He was a beloved husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, and one of the world's great stock pickers. He is survived by his wife Nan, three children and their spouses, and five grandchildren. Howard was Founder and Chairman Emeritus of PRIMECAP Management Company. Previously, he had been Chairman of Capital Research and Management in Los Angeles where he managed the AMCAP Fund until he left in 1983 to start PRIMECAP, where he was known as the lead manager for the Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund. Howard shunned the media because he believed his ideas belonged to their clients. But, his 50 year record as a portfolio manager garnered the attention and respect of the investment community as one of the very best in the mutual fund business. His stock picking ability extended across decades, investment types, company sizes, and market conditions. The one constant was his ability to outperform the market. Howard's colleagues will remember him for his competitive spirit, his utter dedication to his profession, his sense of obligation and responsibility to the client, and his eternal optimism. Howard started his philanthropy as soon as he had the means, and was partial to his alma mater, Williams College, endowing a professorship and giving the lead gift for the Nan and Howard Schow Science Library. In 2000, he funded a private family foundation to support healthcare, education, and the environment at the community level. Just as with his investments, he enjoyed meeting people and seeing results. To date, the foundation has supported 99 organizations, including the new Nan and Howard Schow Trauma Center at Huntington Memorial Hospital. A memorial service will take place at St. Edmunds Church in San Marino, California, on Saturday, April 21, at 10am.

2012-04-12T00:00:00Z,"CHOOKASIAN--Lili, a Contralto with the Metropolitan Opera from 1962 to 1986 and a Professor of Music at Yale University from 1986 to 2009, died on April 10, 2012. She was internationally renowned by conductors, fellow musicians and colleagues for her musicianship, deep, dark, velvet-like singing voice, and unique vocal qualities. She appeared with many of the world's major symphony orchestras and opera companies in a stage career that spanned five decades from the 1940s through the 1960s. In later life, she taught voice at Yale University and lived in Branford, CT. She is survived by three children, 11 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Services will be held at W. S. Clancy Memorial Funeral Home, 244 North Main St., Branford on April 12, 2012 from 4 to 7pm and at St. Vartan's Armenian Cathedral in Manhattan at 11am. The family requests that donations be made, in lieu of flowers, to either Connecticut Hospice in Branford, CT or St. Vartan's Armenian Cathedral in New York City."

Ms. Minaj's new album, ''Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded'' (Young Money/Cash Money/Universal Republic), sold 253,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, easily reaching the top spot on Billboard's chart. It is the second No. 1 album by Ms. Minaj, a Queens-born rapper whose costume closet and onstage persona are possibly even more flamboyant than Lady Gaga's. Her first album, ''Pink Friday,'' opened at No. 2 in late 2010 and reached the top a few months later. (Despite the title, ''Roman Reloaded'' is not a reissue or repackaging, but a new release.)"

2012-04-12T00:00:00Z,"Sell-out rock shows usually mean a lot of shouting, some sweating, maybe a few drunken pass-outs. Kraftwerk inspired none of that on Tuesday night. The first of its eight consecutive sold-out performances at the Museum of Modern Art had reverence and stylistic weight; even for a New York museum crowd there was a lot of black. Artfully swept hair, uncomfortable-looking shoes, architectural glasses: check, check and check. The high-design audience was rewarded with an equally aesthetically tuned concert, with the band, a foursome in graphic black-and-white unitards, playing neon-lighted synths. Behind them a video screen offered a parade of simple 3-D images, like stick figure robots and spinning numbers, a retro future in an MS-DOS font. The show, part of a retrospective for this pioneering German electronica group, was a coveted event, with fewer than 450 tickets available to the public for each night of the run. All eight sold out within an hour when they went on sale in February. (With a face value of $25, they were going for hundreds online afterward.)"
2012-04-12T00:00:00Z,"It seemed like a good idea to check in with David Simon. As a reporter whose book was the basis of the NBC series ''Homicide: Life on the Street'' and as the creator of the HBO series ''The Wire,'' he might have some pertinent things to say about his friend Richard Price's new show, ''NYC 22'' on CBS. Mr. Simon had hired Mr. Price, the author of ''Clockers'' and other novels, to write for ''The Wire,'' and we thought Mr. Simon would understand the differences involved in writing a cop show for cable and one for broadcast. But when the conversation wound back to ''The Wire,'' four years after that endlessly exalted show went off the air, a controversy was born. In the interview, for ArtsBeat, we mentioned that Mr. Price had said that though many people praise ''The Wire'' now, at the time the show was broadcast it didn't draw many viewers and almost couldn't get a Season 4, much less a Season 5."

Mr. Ross said in a statement: ''Despite recent speculation in the media, and after difficult but sincere consideration, I have decided not to direct 'Catching Fire.' As a writer and a director, I simply don't have the time I need to write and prep the movie I would have wanted to make because of the fixed and tight production schedule.''"

(TCM) STARRING LIZA MINNELLI Turner Classic Movies pays tribute to Ms. Minnelli with four films, starting with ''Arthur'' (1981), in which she plays a screwball waitress from Queens pursued by a perpetually drunk Manhattan millionaire (Dudley Moore, above with Ms. Minnelli) who must marry a debutante or lose his inheritance. In the documentary ''Private Screenings: Liza Minnelli,'' at 10, she speaks with Robert Osborne about growing up in Hollywood. The movie lineup resumes at 11 with Martin Scorsese's ''New York, New York'' (1977), in which she's a nightclub singer, with Robert De Niro as a saxophonist. And in Alan J. Pakula's ''Sterile Cuckoo'' (1969), at 2 a.m., she and Wendell Burton play misfit, mismatched college students in love; the film earned Ms. Minnelli the first of her two Oscar nominations. At 4 she also appears in the final scene of ''In the Good Old Summertime'' (1949) with her mother, Judy Garland. 3:30 P.M. (Ovation) THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE (2002) Thandie Newton steps into the Audrey Hepburn role as a new wife who returns to her Paris apartment to break it off with her art-dealing husband, Charlie, only to find the place ransacked, in this remake from Jonathan Demme of the 1963 comic thriller ''Charade.'' And soon she discovers that no one, and nothing, is as is seems. Mark Wahlberg, in the role originated by Cary Grant, portrays the charming stranger eager to be of assistance; Tim Robbins is the man at the United States Embassy she turns to for help. The sensual, butter-voiced Ms. Newton is ''so good that when she's on screen, the movie works -- or at least you think it does,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''It's a spot-specific case of alchemy.'' The film will be rebroadcast at 5:45."

In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell wrote that the film ''is enjoyably lithe and droll yet somehow almost water-soluble; it seems to dissolve on screen.''"

2012-04-13T00:00:00Z,"The Yankees are the most successful franchise in professional sports, having won 27 World Series championships. But the team may be tempting fate by having its home opener on Friday the 13th. Never before, in a history that dates to 1901, has the franchise opened at home or on the road on that date. Of course, the superstition attached to Friday the 13th is just that. But the uneasiness it can cause in people is real - an emotion referred to as friggatriskaidekaphobia (a combination of Frigg, the name of the Norse goddess for whom Friday was named, and triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the number 13)."

But some deadly clashes were reported and activists said areas that had been riven by violence remained under virtual martial law, with tank deployments, armed checkpoints and rooftop snipers. United Nations diplomats said they were encouraged by the apparent adherence to the cease-fire on its first day by President Bashar al-Assad's government and his opponents in the conflict, but emphasized that the government had yet to make good on its pledges under the plan to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from major cities."

The series premiere of ''Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23'' followed, and managed a decent viewer sampling with 7 million.

2012-04-13T00:00:00Z,"ANGELL--Carol Rogge. A legendary, widely admired, and much loved teacher of reading and learning skills at the Brearley School, she died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan of metastatic breast cancer, at the age of seventy-three. She leaves her husband of forty-eight years, Roger Angell; a son, John Henry Angell, of Portland, Oregon; a step-daughter, Alice Angell, of Portland, Maine; a granddaughter, Clara Rose Angell; two step-granddaughters, Laura Gibbons and Lily Anna Evangelista; and a brother, Dr. Peter Rogge, of Sacramento, California. She was a spirited, light-hearted, gently ironic woman who conveyed her passionate bond to literature and writing to generations of young students, many of whom remember her as a life changer and a life model. Born in New York, she was a graduate of the Garden School, in Queens, Bucknell University, and the Columbia Graduate School of Education. Shifting careers after employment as a copy editor with American Heritage Magazine and the Bollingen Series, she came to Brearley in 1980, joining the Department of Reading and Testing (now the Department of Learning Skills), which specializes in intensive work with beginning readers. She served as chairman of the department from 1997 to 2006, but continued as a teacher there until last fall. Her responsibilities included individual tutoring of Upper School English students, which meant that an average day would find her reading ""Frog and Toad Are Friends"" with her first-grade group in one period and then conferring with a senior over a knotty ""King Lear"" paper in the next. Her informality could not quite conceal her professional brilliance, which brought her repeated awards of Brearley's ""Chair of Excellence."" She also established a long-term connection with the East Harlem Storefront School, where she taught during sabbatical leaves. Friends knew her as an effortless but magical cook, a cheerful wife and mother, and a serious devotee of fox terriers and Verdi and Trollope. Summers took her back to her porch in Maine, where, sitting with another open book, she would lift her eyes briefly to the sunlit adjacent waters of Eggemoggin Reach and then, of course, go right on reading."

2012-04-13T00:00:00Z,"When its last two studio albums have inspired a Broadway musical, what does an ambitious punk-rock band do next to keep its listeners scratching their heads? If you're Green Day you go into the studio and get cracking on three new albums to be released in the span of about four months. Following their best-selling 2004 release, ''American Idiot,'' and its 2009 followup, ''21st Century Breakdown,'' whose songs were the basis for the ''American Idiot'' stage musical, the Green Day bandmates Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool said they were back at work with the producer Rob Cavallo in their home town, Oakland, Calif., to record a trilogy of albums: ''¡Uno!,'' scheduled for release on Sept. 25; ''¡Dos!,'' on Nov. 13; and - wait for it - ''¡Tré!'' on Jan. 15 next year. Green Day said in a statement, ''We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives,'' adding: ''Instead of making one album, we are making a three-album trilogy. Every song has the power and energy that represents Green Day on all emotional levels. We just can't help ourselves.'' The triple release by a punk band, with exclamation points, is no mean feat. Perhaps the last act to attempt it was the Clash, which issued a three-album set, ''Sandinista!,'' in 1980, and let's just say there's a reason the group is better remembered for ''London Calling.''"

Mr. Noda declared two units at the Ohi Nuclear Power Plant in western Japan to be safe based on the results of computer simulations designed to check the reactors' tolerance of a large earthquake and tsunami like those last year that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. But he must convince skeptical leaders and voters in Fukui Prefecture, the site of the Ohi plant, that it is safe to turn the reactors back on. Currently, only one of the nation's 54 commercial reactors is operating. The shutdowns, which have cut the nation's electricity supply by up to a third, have raised concerns about higher energy prices and power shortages."

The suit concerns a case in which a reporter who is no longer with the newspaper hacked into the e-mail account of a police detective who ran an award-winning blog. The claim, said the lawyer, Mark Lewis, ''is not just on misuse of information or privacy grounds, but also a claim for what lawyers would call deceit,'' based on denials the newspaper made. A spokeswoman for News International confirmed the lawsuit had been filed but declined to comment further. The blogger's true identity was not publicly known until an article in The Times of London in 2009 identified him. At a hearing in February into press ethics and practices, James Harding, the editor of The Times of London, apologized on behalf of the newspaper, reversing its earlier denials."

2012-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Thousands of Islamists converged on Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday to protest the candidacy of Omar Suleiman, left, who served as President Hosni Mubarak's spy chief, saying he would halt democratic reforms. The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, helped organize the rally, which drew an overwhelmingly Islamist crowd, including ultraconservative Salafists. Banners linked Mr. Suleiman, who says he wants to restore order and limit the Islamists' power, to the ousted Mr. Mubarak and urged Egypt's revolution to continue ''until we are done with both of them.'' One protester, Khaled el-Shafei, 38, an archaeologist who supports the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Khairat el-Shater, said, ''I would be happy with any elected president -- an Islamist or a liberal -- as long as they are not an army officer or a remnant of the old regime.''

But while his star turn on Broadway in ''Dracula'' transformed him into a matinee idol for a brief period, and he has won three Tonys and worked consistently ever since, Mr. Langella never became a major film star and never achieved the kind of immortality bestowed on many of the luminaries who glide through his terrific new memoir, amusingly titled ''Dropped Names.'' This may have been a piece of inordinate good luck, you come to feel after dipping into the book. For Mr. Langella's encounters with a glittering roster of famous names are often shot through with a haunting sense of melancholy, a sensitive awareness of the cruel exigencies of great public acclaim, which is almost always transitory."

(Starz) MONEYBALL (2011) Brad Pitt, above -- giving what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called ''the quintessential Brad Pitt performance'' -- earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Beane, the real-life general manager of the Oakland Athletics who transformed the team, one of the poorest in baseball, into a serious competitor against wealthier franchises by essentially ignoring everything he'd been taught about the game. Jonah Hill, also nominated, plays Peter Brand, a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale, and a disciple of Bill James, a statistician who, starting in 1977, devised a radical way of understanding baseball data. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is the team's manager, Art Howe, who isn't about to buy into the newfangled approach that his boss and his protégé insist will create a winner. The director Bennett Miller, ''largely shaking off the official art-house pretensions of his breakout feature, 'Capote,' takes all this seemingly dry, dusty, inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high,'' Ms. Dargis said of this fictionalized adaptation of the book by Michael Lewis. ''Moneyball'' also received nominations for best screenplay for Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the script, and Stan Chervin, who provided the story, as well as for best film. 10:30 A.M.

Mr. Cohen stopped working with the former manager, Kelley Lynch, in 2004, and had obtained a court order for her to stop contacting him. The case against Ms. Lynch, decided Thursday in a Los Angeles court, centered on messages that she sent the singer between February 2011 and January of this year, which prosecutors said made Mr. Cohen's life ''a complete and utter living hell,'' according to The A.P."

She leaves her husband of forty-eight years, Roger Angell; a son, John Henry Angell, of Portland, Oregon; a step-daughter, Alice Angell, of Portland, Maine; a granddaughter, Clara Rose Angell; two step-granddaughters, Laura Gibbons and Lily Anna Evangelista; and a brother, Dr. Peter Rogge, of Sacramento, California.

Born in New York, she was a graduate of the Garden School, in Queens, Bucknell University, and the Columbia Graduate School of Education. Shifting careers after employment as a copy editor with American Heritage Magazine and the Bollingen Series, she came to Brearley in 1980, joining the Department of Reading and Testing (now the Department of Learning Skills), which specializes in intensive work with beginning readers. She served as chairman of the department from 1997 to 2006, but continued as a teacher there until last fall. Her responsibilities included individual tutoring of Upper School English students, which meant that an average day would find her reading ""Frog and Toad Are Friends"" with her first-grade group in one period and then conferring with a senior over a knotty ""King Lear"" paper in the next. Her informality could not quite conceal her professional brilliance, which brought her repeated awards of Brearley's ""Chair of Excellence."" She also established a long-term connection with the East Harlem Storefront School, where she taught during sabbatical leaves. Friends knew her as an effortless but magical cook, a cheerful wife and mother, and a serious devotee of fox terriers and Verdi and Trollope. Summers took her back to her porch in Maine, where, sitting with another open book, she would lift her eyes briefly to the sunlit adjacent waters of Eggemoggin Reach and then, of course, go right on reading."
2012-04-14T00:00:00Z,"A full slate of repeats on CBS allowed the other broadcast networks to gain some ground in the ratings on Thursday. Fox was by far the No. 1 network for the night, according to Nielsen data, as both ''American Idol'' and ''Touch'' received a bump in viewership from last week. They finished with 15.3 million total viewers and 8.2 million, respectively. ABC also benefited from the lack of competition. Not only did ''Grey's Anatomy'' bounce back from season lows, but the political drama ''Scandal'' also posted higher numbers, including 7.5 million total viewers, in its second week than its premiere. It's a rare feat for a new program."

2012-04-14T00:00:00Z,"ROME -- After London, Barcelona and Paris, Woody Allen's newest tribute to a European capital, ''To Rome With Love,'' had its premiere here on Friday. But the amorous sentiment may not be requited judging by the grumblings of some Italian journalists and film critics at a crowded post-screening news conference. ''Your Italy is superficial, full of escorts, where Italians come across as nonexistent people,'' said one seemingly peeved female journalist who suggested that Mr. Allen might have been influenced by the widely reported antics of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is embroiled in a sex scandal. The journalist later gushed, ''But I loved the film.'' (Mr. Allen retorted that he had ''no insight into Italian politics, or culture,'' adding, ''I just wanted to make a film set in Rome that would be entertaining to see.'')"

The comments by a Democratic strategist Wednesday night about Ann Romney's work history were condemned by Mr. Obama and his inner circle but only reinforced the sense that a lot Democrats are primed to play rough in 2012."

In addition to statuesque heels and brogues, he's done several variations on the boot theme: Parisian motorcyclists, sinuous thigh-highs, sturdy jodhpurs (above; $795 at Robert Clergerie's New York and Los Angeles stores, and at barneys.com).

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"There may be no better barometer of a designer's commercial success than retailers and consumers clamoring for those interim collections known as resort and prefall. So after four seasons of challenging pieces like patterned pajama sets and over-the-top quilted coats, the Northern Irish designer J. W. Anderson (left) has come down to earth - at least a little - for his first prefall collection. Alongside straight-leg pants, pleated skirts and jewel-tone turtlenecks (including one in blue with bright green sleeves), Anderson still offers plenty of quilting: a white A-line skirt, a red-and-white checkerboard print jacket and two puffy bombers, one in black patent leather and another in brown with white sleeves and a shearling collar. ''I like the idea of storytelling, and for me this collection was the prequel to my fall collection,'' the designer says. ''Both collections are for the same woman and for me all the pieces work together, but I definitely aimed to design clothes that were easier and more relatable.'' That doesn't mean Anderson has lost touch with the avant-garde. For fall expect vinyl suiting, pillow-top apron skirts and a curious take on the deerstalker cap.

Economic voters are shortsighted, it turns out, and their myopia makes American electoral accountability surprisingly haphazard. Sixty years of political history suggest that income growth in the months leading up to Election Day has a strong, consistent impact on the incumbent party's re-election prospects -- what happens in the rest of a president's term is mostly irrelevant. If the last 15 presidential elections are a reliable guide, income growth between now and Nov. 6 will matter more to voters than how the economy has fared through President Obama's first 39 months in the White House."

Just like tously bedhead can increase a woman's hot factor, so can last night's makeup. Not only because of the way it looks, but also for the narrative it implies. (Provided you're not too puffy from last night's martini, of course.) I love the way loose pigment from M.A.C. or Make Up For Ever melts into the creases of my lids and creeps down the corners of my eyes while I sleep, and how Lip Tar from Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics leaves a telling stain on my lips. A slightly smudgy cat eye in the morning reminds me of the sex kitten I was the night before. Mascara should be a strictly cumulative affair, if you ask me; it's so much better after two or three days' worth of top coats. I'm not the only one to embrace this beauty taboo. Lady Gaga has said she hits the hay in full makeup seven nights a week. The Warhol Factory superstar Edie Sedgwick reportedly never removed her fake lashes; she just kept adding more.

Her daughter's slender hips rocked from side to side as she moved up the steps. It was as if she had to lift her entire body to bring up each leg. Her mother was certain that something was wrong. 1.

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"THE MATA FESTIVAL, an annual springtime explosion of new music, offers a bracing overview of the styles that young composers and performers are exploring right now. This year's prospectus is dominated by indie classical works -- hybrids in which classical, avant-garde, pop and world music elements are combined to yield results that are not quite in any of those languages. An opening-night performance and party at the Paula Cooper Gallery includes performances by the inventive loadbang ensemble, as well as electronic remixes of works from festival concerts by the electronica virtuoso Preshish Moments. The main concerts, at Roulette, start Wednesday with a battle of the bands, of sorts: the JACK Quartet and the Quartet New Generation -- a new-music recorder consort, of all things -- will play works by Huck Hodge and Qin Yi. Thursday is devoted to composer-performers, with Cecilia Lopez, Matt Marks, Mellissa Hughes and Kate Soper presiding over their own works. And Friday, Signal, the superb orchestra led by Brad Lubman, will play an international program that includes music by Francesco Filidei, Eric Wubbels, David Coll, Alex Freeman and Ivan Orozco. 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, $50; Wednesday to -Friday, 509 Atlantic Avenue, at Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $20 to $25."

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"IT seemed slightly improbable when, five years ago, the American Ballet Theater principal Ángel Corella started his own company in the Spanish province of Segovia. Spain has never been known for its classical dance troupes, nor did Mr. Corella have major benefactors or initial state support. But his boldness and determination to give Spain its own ballet troupe seems to have paid off. His company, which opens a short New York season at City Center on Tuesday, has 65 dancers and has found a new home in Barcelona. For the BARCELONA BALLET'S New York run Mr. Corella will dance with his company in ''Pálpito,'' a new piece by Ángel Rojas and Carlos Rodríguez, set to an original score by Héctor González. Since Mr. Rojas and Mr. Rodríguez are the directors of the flamenco troupe Nuevo Ballet Español, a ballet-flamenco fusion seems likely. But there's also plenty of ballet-ballet, in the form of Clark Tippet's ''Bruch Violin Concerto,'' with its multiple impassioned pas de deux, and Christopher Wheeldon's little-seen ''For 4,'' set to Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden.'' 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; tickets start at $25."

Three years and an album later (''Lights Out''), the sound they thought wouldn't make waves outside his London flat - synchronized vocals and two electric guitars - has Britain enthralled (now the States, too: the band is fresh off a splashy debut at South by Southwest).

Eventually, these art textiles were turned into commercial clothing: a Joan Miró dress, a Salvador Dalí tie.

Born in San Francisco, she moved to Japan at the age of 10. A talented concert pianist at an early age, by 1937 she participated in the International Chopin Competition in Poland. In 1941 she continued piano studies in San Francisco until the attack on Pearl Harbor led to her forced evacuation to the Santa Anita Assembly Center followed by relocation to the Topaz internment camp in Utah. In 1943 she secured release to work for the anthropologist, John Embree in Chicago. In 1944 she moved to Manhattan and began a career at the Columbia University Library, eventually becoming Head of the Japanese Collection working to develop it into the superb collection it is today and trained many librarians from Japanese institutions. Her work had a profound impact on the Columbia library community and Japanese Studies scholars. In 1983, after almost four decades of service, a plaque in the Starr East Asian Library reading room was dedicated to her and a cherry tree planted in her honor outside Kent Hall. Despite her official retirement that year she worked tirelessly as a researcher and bibliographic assistant to the University Committee on Asia and the Middle East, continued to assist visiting scholars, published several catalogs and completed a comprehensive history of the East Asian Library's Japanese Collection. In 1995, the Japanese Government conferred her with the Order of the Precious Crown, Wisteria for her efforts to enhance cultural exchange. Her wit, energy and boundless spirit will truly be missed. A Memorial Service to celebrate her remarkable life will be held on Friday, April 20 at 11AM at the C.V. Starr East Asian Library, 300 Kent Hall, Columbia University.

He guarded Josh Harrellson, finished his shots well - including a layup in traffic - and jawed at teammates. While this was a practice involving mostly second-unit players, Stoudemire did not appear hampered by the bulging disk in his back that has kept him out since March 26."

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"With her severe bob and heavy line of red lipstick, the author Herta Müller looks like she fell out of an Otto Dix painting. After Müller won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2009, one critic sniped that she should get a new haircut, lest foreigners assume that's how all German women look. Other reactions to the Nobel news were more basic: ''Herta who?'' Now there is ''The Hunger Angel'' (Metropolitan Books, $26), a translation of the novel that came out the year Müller won the prize. The original German title, ''Atemschaukel,'' is hard to translate but refers roughly to the act of breathing - something the book's narrator, Leo Auberg, can no longer take for granted. He fears for his life, and with good reason: it's 1945, and Leo is a gay ethnic German living in Romania, about to be packed off to a hard labor camp in Ukraine to help ''rebuild'' the Soviet Union."
2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"What's the secret to a great dress? Sunhee Hwang, a South Korean-born designer whose second collection won her an Ecco Domani prize this year, has this tip: ''Before thoughts of fine fabrics, look for beautiful colors,'' she says. ''That's what gets us into the dressing rooms in the hopes of finding winsome silhouettes and flattering lines.'' Hwang certainly has a way with a frock herself: at the 1995 Fashion Institute of Technology graduation show, her tangerine gown attracted the attention of the Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz, then at Geoffrey Beene. ''He said to me, 'Your dresses are very beautiful. Why don't you work for me?' '' recalls Hwang, now 38. After stints at Beene, Anna Sui, Elie Tahari and Anne Klein, Hwang is back in the limelight with knockout Sunhee dresses, like an airy silk confection in maize yellow (above right; $825 at sunheeny.com) and a flirty salsa number in rich cobalt ($395 at sunheeny.com). ''When you look at beautiful clothes, it doesn't matter who the designer is,'' she says, citing Narciso Rodriguez's color-blocked sheaths and Jonathan Saunders's vibrant shifts as examples of smart fits in smashing colors. ''As long as you look gorgeous and feel special, you will buy it. I'm just hoping it's my dress.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"''There's really no logic,'' says Peter Philips, Chanel's creative director for makeup, explaining how he dreams up nail colors that regularly achieve mythic status before they even hit store counters. ''I observe and listen to women, and then I follow my heart and my guts. It's not a factory. I'm not a chicken that lays an egg. I just try to seduce women into discovering something they want. Because if they don't like it, they won't wear it.'' Philips is obviously on to something, because Chanel's nail polish sales have grown in the United States by 84 percent in the four years since he joined the brand. His biggest success to date has been Particulière, an unusual greige hue that graced the fingertips of fashionable women the world over when it made its debut in 2010. ''That color was a bit of an accident, actually,'' Philips says. ''It was a failed tryout for a purple taupe shade I had requested, but when I applied a swipe to my nail, I was blown away.''"

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"If there is such a thing as a good time to face the Heat, the Knicks may have found it. The Heat have lost three of their last five games. The two victories came against the sub-.500 Detroit Pistons and Charlotte Bobcats. The Knicks have won four of five games, including wins over Chicago and Milwaukee. The Knicks will continue to use an unorthodox lineup, with Carmelo Anthony starting at power forward in place of Amar'e Stoudemire. That strategy will be put to the test if Anthony is guarded by Chris Bosh, to whom he gives up at least three inches. But Anthony has speed that Bosh will find hard to handle. The Knicks, who have seven games left in the regular season, play their final three home games against teams that are almost surely headed to the playoffs: the Heat, the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Clippers."

He returned to Ghana with his family from 1974-1975 to serve another term as a Volunteer. In September 2011 Klein received a Commendation from the House of Representatives in recognition of his book.

At the time, Touhami, who is French Moroccan, was commuting between Tokyo, where he was consulting for the brand And A, and Paris, where he had opened the store L'Epicerie; was curating 33-1 R Lax, an in-store boutique for Bon Marché; and trying to get an e-commerce site, Hypeteam.com, off the ground. De Taillac, who works in public relations and writes about beauty, has roots in France that go back centuries. Living out of hotels, she told him, was not going to fly. Some 15 years and three children later, however, the ''T-n-T'' clan, as they are affectionately known, are living a life of nomads, hopping from continent to continent and city to city - Paris, Jaipur, Tangier - setting up camp in temporary lodgings and then, when it's time to move on, literally pulling the rug out from beneath their feet. ''We do two years per country,'' Touhami says. ''That is my rule.'' And that would sound like a compromise in the couple's relationship if it weren't for their incredible talent for making themselves at home no matter where they are in the world."

He was a beloved husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, and one of the world's great stock pickers. He is survived by his wife Nan, three children and their spouses, and five grandchildren. Howard was Founder and Chairman Emeritus of PRIMECAP Management Company. Previously, he had been Chairman of Capital Research and Management in Los Angeles where he managed the AMCAP Fund until he left in 1983 to start PRIMECAP, where he was known as the lead manager for the Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund. Howard shunned the media because he believed his ideas belonged to their clients. But, his 50 year record as a portfolio manager garnered the attention and respect of the investment community as one of the very best in the mutual fund business. His stock picking ability extended across decades, investment types, company sizes, and market conditions. The one constant was his ability to outperform the market. Howard's colleagues will remember him for his competitive spirit, his utter dedication to his profession, his sense of obligation and responsibility to the client, and his eternal optimism. Howard started his philanthropy as soon as he had the means, and was partial to his alma mater, Williams College, endowing a professorship and giving the lead gift for the Nan and Howard Schow Science Library. In 2000, he funded a private family foundation to support healthcare, education, and the environment at the community level. Just as with his investments, he enjoyed meeting people and seeing results. To date, the foundation has supported 99 organizations, including the new Nan and Howard Schow Trauma Center at Huntington Memorial Hospital. A memorial service will take place at St. Edmunds Church in San Marino, California, on Saturday, April 21, at 10am.

He was the beloved husband and best friend to Rovena Marcus for more than 42 years. Born and raised in the Lower East Side of NYC, Phil went on to accomplish greatness, as a doctor, a family man and philanthropist. He graduated from Columbia University, cum laude with a BS degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences with honors in Pharmacology. He went on to receive his medical degree from State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center, College of Medicine, graduating summa cum laude. He was the founder of Nassau Chest Physicians and served on the Board of Directors of the American Lung Association. He also served as Chief of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at St. Francis Hospital-The Heart Center in Roslyn, NY. Phil was a consummate student and in 1999 at the Bloomberg School of Public Health-John Hopkins University where he earned the M.P.H. degree in May, 2002. A passionate student, Phil was an equally passionate teacher. He was actively involved in teaching medical students as well as residents in Internal Medicine and Pulmonary Medicine. He was a Clinical Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology and the Associate Dean for Curriculum Development at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine. He held teaching appointments at State University of New York at Stony Brook, St. John's University, and NYU School of Medicine. Philanthropy played an important role in Phil's life. Having grown up in extremely humble conditions, those in need were never far from his mind. He generously supported myriad causes and organizations. Phil was a major fundraiser for Jewish causes including UJA, Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem as well as an advocate for accessible health care supporting the American Lung Association and RotaCare both of which he was honored by for his work.

Affectionately known as Pop-Phil, he spent much of his free time with his children and grandchildren, often hosting big family dinners that were filled with a lot of energy and laughter. In addition to being survived by his wife Rovena of Jericho; Phil is also survived by his in-laws and surrogate parents Morton and Harriet Shreck; sons: Mitch husband of Sarah Marcus of Forest Hills, Brian husband of Faith Marcus of New York City, a daughter Alyssa wife of Gary Klein of Harrisburg Pennsylvania; and grandchildren, Max Marcus, Luke Marcus, Julia Klein, Jake Marcus, Jenna Klein and Liam Philip Marcus."

2012-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Brad Lidge pitched just 25 games for the Philadelphia Phillies last season, but his earned run average was 1.40, and he struck out more than a batter an inning. Even so, the Phillies were content to let Lidge go to a division rival, the Nationals, who signed him to be a setup man for Drew Storen. ''This bullpen, I feel, is very loaded at the back end,'' Lidge said before last Monday's game against the Mets. ''That kind of depth is huge. It's paying off for us a little bit right now, with having Storen out. When he gets back, I'd be surprised if we're not one of the better ones in the bigs.''"

Only 10 percent of 26 million golfers in the United States belong to private clubs. The average price of 18 holes on a weekend, with a golf cart, is about $40."

2012-04-17T00:00:00Z,"9:28 p.m. | Updated A new joint fund-raising initiative between Mitt Romney and the Republican National Committee will aim to raise $800 million by November, part of what Mr. Romney's campaign estimates will be a total of $1 billion spent to defeat President Obama and elect Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor. The goals were laid out in a memorandum circulated by Mr. Romney's top fund-raisers in recent days and on a conference call with donors late last week. The memo indicates that Mr. Romney's top aides hope to collect a total of at least $500 million for the campaign and for the joint fund, known as Romney Victory, through a program for high-dollar donations."

2012-04-17T00:00:00Z,"The Sex Pistols said they would rerelease ''God Save the Queen'' in late May for the 35th anniversary of the single's controversial debut back in 1977, the New Musical Express reported. First released during Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee, the song created a political firestorm. The lyrics and nihilistic vision of Britain's future offended many people and the BBC refused to play it: ''God save the Queen/ She ain't no human being / There is no future / In England's dreaming.'' (The Sex Pistols, never ones for understatement, also referred to the British government as ''a facist regime.'') Still, the song went to No. 2 on the British singles chart. The rereleased single is expected to be available on May 28. In September the band plans to put out a new expanded edition of their album ''Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols,'' according to their Web site. In February, Reuters reported that the band had entered into a deal with Universal to put out the anniversary edition of the album, which was their only studio LP."
2012-04-17T00:00:00Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Ten times a week, 48 weeks a year, the Cirque du Soleil spectacle ''Ka'' plays inside the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino here. The show, created and directed by Robert Lepage, occupies the custom-built Ka Theater, which has a capacity just under 2,000. Since ''Ka'' opened, on Feb. 3, 2005, more than 5.5 million people have arrived amid hissing flames and tribal drums to watch it. It would take 1,375 sold-out performances to draw that many people to the Metropolitan Opera House. So it is unlikely that Mr. Lepage's Met production of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle, now running in its first complete iteration, will ever beat ''Ka'' in spectator numbers, even if it survives temperamental machinery and temperamental critics. But it was clear after I saw the 90-minute ''Ka'' on Friday evening that Mr. Lepage's ''Ring'' matches his Cirque du Soleil extravaganza in other, more telling and more depressing ways."

But is eliminating meat and dairy as simple as it sounds? As countless aspiring vegans are discovering, the switch from omnivore to herbivore is fraught with physical, social and economic challenges - at least, for those who don't have a personal chef. The struggle to give up favorite foods like cheese and butter can be made all the harder by harsh words and eye-rolling from unsympathetic friends and family members. Substitutes like almond milk and rice milk can shock the taste buds, and vegan specialty and convenience foods can cost two to three times what their meat and dairy equivalents do. And new vegans quickly discover that many foods in grocery stores and on restaurant menus have hidden animal ingredients."

2012-04-17T00:00:00Z,"10 P.M. (13, 49) THE REAL CSI Who doesn't enjoy armchair sleuthing alongside the fictional forensics experts in shows like ''CSI''? But in real life the field of forensics has few uniform standards and sometimes relies on unproven science. In this ''Frontline'' episode (above, Joanna Grivetti of the Richmond, Calif., police), part of the ''Post Mortem'' collaboration between ProPublica and the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley, Lowell Bergman looks at the murder trial of Casey Anthony, the Madrid terrorist bombing and capital cases in rural Mississippi to examine how flaws and inconsistencies in some of the best-known forensic tools can undermine the search for justice. The investigation follows a study by the National Academy of Sciences. 7 P.M. (HBO) THE DILEMMA (2011) Vince Vaughn stars as Ronny, and Kevin James is Nick, best buddies enthralled by beautiful women (Jennifer Connelly and Winona Ryder), and business partners who are designing an engine that combines fuel efficiency with muscle-car brawn and noise. But what is Ronny to do when, amid planning the perfect proposal for his girlfriend, he spies Nick's seemingly devoted wife in a lip lock with another man (Channing Tatum)? '' 'The Dilemma,' written by Allan Loeb and directed by Ron Howard -- hardly a name associated with frat-boy yukfests -- is not entirely what it appears to be,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''It is less a macho comedy than what you might call a bromantic melodrama, an unabashed weepie with enough beer, sports, fistfights and cars to reassure the snuffling he-men in the audience that their tears are not ... well, you know.''"

2012-04-17T00:00:00Z,"Some people respond to exercise by eating more. Others eat less. For many years, scientists thought that changes in hormones, spurred by exercise, dictated whether someone's appetite would increase or drop after working out. But now new neuroscience is pointing to another likely cause. Exercise may change your desire to eat, two recent studies show, by altering how certain parts of your brain respond to the sight of food. In one study, scientists brought 30 young, active men and women to a lab at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo for two experimental sessions, where they draped their heads in functional M.R.I. coils. The researchers wanted to track activity in portions of the brain known as the food-reward system, which includes the poetically named insula, putamen and rolandic operculum. These brain regions have been shown to control whether we like and want food. In general, the more cells firing there, the more we want to eat."

Mr. Naidu, reached by telephone on Tuesday, said he could not comment because he had not seen the complaint. ''This is crazy, that I'm hearing about it this way,'' he said. ''We haven't even resumed operations. What are they talking about?'' 4:33 p.m. | Updated In a statement later, Mr. Naidu rejected the charge. He said the company and union in 2007 had ''entered into an agreement that formally severed ties.'' He continued, ''Nurturing artists and art-making are central to the Dance Theater of Harlem mission/-we will never compromise either.''"

This latest sign of the times is a result of a product placement deal between the brewers of Heineken beer and the producers of the ''James Bond'' movie franchise, one that even the series star, Daniel Craig, is lamenting as ''unfortunate.'' Advertising Age reported that Heineken USA was preparing a promotional campaign to coincide with the Nov. 9 release of the next Bond movie, ''Skyfall.'' (Yes, ''Skyfall.'')

The play, the second part of a trilogy, ran for less than a month in its world premiere at Hartford Stage in late 2011. The other two finalists, Jon Robin Baitz's ''Other Desert Cities'' and Stephen Karam's ''Sons of the Prophet,'' were far better known, having enjoyed prominent and well-received New York productions; ''Other Desert Cities'' is playing on Broadway and is a likely contender for the Tony Award for best play, to be announced in June. This is not the first time the Pulitzer has gone to a play on the strength of the script as opposed to a production. (None of the five jurors saw ''Water'' in Hartford.) That's completely permissible according to the prize rules, but it tends to ruffle feathers; the last time this happened -- when Nilo Cruz's ''Anna in the Tropics'' won sight unseen in 2003 -- the theater critic John Lahr of The New Yorker sniffed that it was ''as absurd as giving a restaurant four stars on the basis of its menu.''"

2012-04-19T00:00:00Z,"A literary partnership between Charles Dickens and J. R. R. Tolkien would have been downright impossible, if not undesirable. (A tale of hungry workhouse hobbits who want more gruel? An evil, all-seeing eye visited by foreboding spirits on Christmas?) But a London publisher has nonetheless found a way to get their names onto the same project, in the form of a collaboration between descendants of Tolkien and Dickens, BBC News reported. The publisher Thames River Press said it would release two fantasy novels written by Michael Tolkien, aimed at younger readers and based on stories told to him by his grandfather, the ''Lord of the Rings'' author J. R. R. Tolkien. Gerald Dickens, a great-great grandson of Dickens, will narrate the audiobook releases. BBC News said the first book, called ''Wish,'' was inspired by the Florence Bone story ''The Rose-Colored Wish'' and chronicles two children who come into possession of an evil sorcerer's enchanted artifact; the second book, ''Rainbow,'' takes its inspiration from another work by Ms. Bone called ''The Other Side of the Rainbow.''

The mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe plays Eduige, Bertarido's sister, and the British countertenor Iestyn Davies makes his Met debut as Bertarido's faithful friend Unulfo. ''The specialist Mr. Scholl, apart from his splendid lyrical gifts, gave an occasional lesson in what is now thought to be an appropriate use of vibrato in Baroque music, starting with straight tone and gradually warming it with vibration,'' James R. Oestreich wrote in The New York Times about this production, directed by Stephen Wadsworth, conducted by the Baroque specialist Harry Bicket and presented here by ''Great Performances at the Met.''

In a post published Tuesday on the Web site of his band, Guns N' Roses, Mr. Rose offered his apologies to his fans and to the people of Cleveland for snubbing last Saturday's induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, writing that he ''seriously didn't plan on or expect the overwhelmingly positive response and public support for my decision.'' Last week the mercurial Mr. Rose announced in an open letter that he would not attend the induction ceremony honoring Guns N' Roses (as well as acts like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beastie Boys) and asked that he not be inducted in absentia, citing a grab bag of personal and professional issues that included the ''endless amount of revisionism'' of his band's history and ''the greed of this industry and the ever present seemingly limitless supply of wannabes and unscrupulous, irresponsible media types.''"

Started as a project to help revitalize downtown neighborhoods after Sept. 11, the festival has evolved in several ways over the past decade. And making choices about the kinds of films the festival will show has always been an important factor in its growth. This year a new team is making those choices. The artistic director, Frédéric Boyer (above right), was artistic director and chief programmer of the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes. Genna Terranova (right), who comes from an acquisitions background and was the festival's senior programmer, has been promoted to director of programming. And Geoffrey Gilmore (below right), who was the longtime director of the Sundance Film Festival before taking over as chief creative officer at Tribeca in 2009, has expanded his programming role."

2012-04-19T00:00:00Z,"COHEN--Rabbi Jack. The Board and all those associated with The Mordecai M. Kaplan Center for Jewish Peoplehood mourn the passing of our beloved Honorary Chairman, Rabbi Dr. Jack J. Cohen of Jerusalem, who died there on April 16 at the age of 93. The Jewish people have lost a giant of a teacher and a role model. One of Mordecai Kaplan's greatest and most devoted disciples, Jack was the foremost advocate in Israel for the Reconstructionist approach to Judaism for more than 50 years. Among many other accomplishments, Jack was a founder of Congregation Mevakshei Derech in Jerusalem and the creator of its Kaplan Center. A man of enormous talents and erudition, Jack also exemplified true humility and treated all human beings with respect and kindness. His tireless passion for continuing the work of his teacher Mordecai Kaplan was an inspiration to all of us. We will miss both Jack's intellectual leadership and the gentleness of his soul. Jack's memory will forever be a blessing. Eric Caplan Daniel Cedarbaum Mel Scult Jack Wolofsky"

The Rodgers and Hammerstein version of ''Cinderella'' began as a television musical in 1957, and has been performed in theaters and opera houses but never on Broadway. The new production features a freshly written book by Douglas Carter Beane (''Lysistrata Jones,'' ''The Little Dog Laughed''), who has added some modern-minded twists to the classic story; this time around, for instance, it is Cinderella who rescues the prince."

He and his brother John transformed their taxi business into what was to become the largest black car and limousine business in the New York metropolitan area. The business is now carried on by the fourth generation of Aciernos. Although now gone, his spirit and family values will live on with those he touched. His family will receive friends at Burroughs, Kohr and Dangler Funeral Home, 309 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ on Friday April 20, between the hours of 2-4 and 7-9pm.

And apparently selling a stage production of that tale to British theatergoers is no picnic either. The producers of a theatrical version of ''The King's Speech,'' which dramatizes the story of King George VI and his speech therapist, Lionel Logue, that transferred to London's West End last month announced that it would close early because of poor ticket sales, The Telegraph reported. As a film, ''The King's Speech'' was a regal success, winning four Academy Awards last year, including one for best picture; one for best actor to Colin Firth, who portrayed George VI; and one for its original screenplay by David Seidler. As a play, also written by Mr. Seidler and directed by Adrian Noble, it opened in February at the Yvonne Arnaud Theater in Guilford and transferred in March to the Wyndham's Theater in the West End. It received some respectable reviews there - Time Out London said that the actor Charles Edwards made an even better George VI, ''bringing a subtlety, understated wit and mercurial flair'' that Mr. Firth lacked - and was slated to run through July 21. But producers said it will now close May 12."

Jessica Chastain plays Jack's mother, whose grief, and that of her husband's, over the loss of their son casts a shadow of tragedy on everything that will follow. And Hunter McCracken, a first-time actor, is Jack as a boy. ''The sheer beauty of this film is almost overwhelming,'' A. O.

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"THE Broadway season, in a sense, screeches to a halt this week, as the deadline for Tony consideration arrives. (Nominations will be announced May 1.) The end has come unusually early, causing a dizzying pileup of seven opening nights in a single week. The roster gives an accurate if not always inspiring snapshot of the current state of commercial theater. From the Broadway Screening Room category come two new musicals: ''GHOST,'' a London import based on the 1990 hit movie, and ''LEAP OF FAITH,'' after the (nonhit) Steve Martin movie about an evangelist, with Raúl Esparza in the lead. ''THE LYONS,'' a Nicky Silver play starring Linda Lavin, represents the Questionable Off Broadway Transfer. From the High-Concept Revival department comes ''STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE,'' starring Blair Underwood, which features a multi-ethnic cast with an emphasis on black actors. The Nostalgia Repackaged entry is a pseudo new musical, ''NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT,'' featuring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara singing Gershwin tunes. ''DON'T DRESS FOR DINNER,'' a farce by Marc Camoletti (''Boeing-Boeing''), is an example of the If-It-Worked-Once approach to producing."

That's clear from ''Tallulah,'' the most striking song from this band's just-released second album, ''Europe'' (Slumberland).

''I'm wondering if I've already heard/all the songs that'll mean something,'' she exhales, ''and I'm wondering if I've already met/all the people that'll mean something.'' That's not to say that all of ''Europe'' strikes such aching notes, but even the most animated songs on this album have a wistfulness coursing through them, whether they're talking about singers of riot grrrl bands, wearing your grandparents' clothes, or the mundanities of falling for someone else. Most of this is balanced with chipper arrangements, and as a result Allo Darlin' shows can be high-spirited affairs.

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"CONDON--Joseph H. Ph. D, An experimental physicist, engineer, and computer scientist, died on January 2, 2012 at the age of 76. He, in partnership with Ken Thompson, created Belle, a pioneering combination of computer and special hardware that played championship-quality chess. Joseph was born in Princeton, NJ on February 15, 1935, to Emilie Honzik Condon and the noted theoretical physicist, Edward Uhler (E. U.) Condon, and was named after the 19th century American physicist, Joseph Henry. Joe earned a B.S. in physics from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in physics from Northwestern University. He and his wife of 51 years, Carol (nee Merklinger) Condon, Ph.D., have resided in Summit, NJ since 1963, when Joseph joined AT&T Bell Laboratories at Murray Hill, NJ. Joseph started his research career at Bell Labs in low temperature solid-state physics. His initial research centered on developing an ultra-sensitive torsion balance to study the electronic band structure of metals. His seminal research on the low temperature behavior of pure metals showed that, under certain conditions, magnetic domains can form in nonmagnetic metals such as beryllium. He developed a theory of such domains and obtained experimental verification of his theory. He had wide ranging interests, and it was difficult to remain focused on low temperature solid-state physics when a digital revolution was in progress. In 1968 he contributed to the emerging technologies of digital switching and produced many patents in that area. By 1975 Joe had joined the Computer Research Center at Bell Labs where, around the same time, the C programming language and the Unix operating system were created. Joe collaborated with Sandy Fraser to automate the laborious and error-prone task of manually converting a circuit drawing into a circuit board by designing the Unix Circuit Design System (UCDS). This system launched an era of rapid prototype construction for research and product development. The purpose of another of Joe's projects was to convince AT&T's development organizations to adopt the C programming language for their switching system control programs. To this end, it was decided that C should be used to reprogram an existing switch. Joe made the necessary hardware changes and Ken Thompson wrote the necessary software programs so that the re-write in C was a success and hastened the adoption of C for all switching system's software within AT&T. Another major collaboration between Joe and Ken Thompson was the creation of the chess-playing machine named Belle. Joe designed custom hardware while Ken designed the software. The hardware evaluated board position, did piece move generation, and used a cache memory for previously evaluated board positions. Belle's hardware could evaluate millions of board positions and generate all legal chess moves every second. The control software kept track of how many moves ahead the hardware was evaluating and selected the best current move. Belle achieved a master rating. It won the World Computer Chess Championship in 1980 and the ACM North American Computer Chess Championships in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1986. Joseph was a physicist and engineer noted for his insight and intuition into physical systems and for talented digital system design. His designs were parsimonious and supremely effective, yet his collaborations were generous and never compromised by ego. Joe had a delightful sense of humor and unlimited curiosity. He loved to travel with Carol in their recreational vehicle and loved American Indian crafts, classical music, and the theatre. He was very active in The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and was a frequent volunteer in the FISH Hospitality Program. In addition to his beloved wife, Carol, Dr. Condon is survived by a brother, Paul Edward Condon, Ph.D., of Lafayette, CO, and was predeceased by a sister, Marie Condon Thornton of Berkeley, CA. Other survivors include a sister-in-law and husband, many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews. A memorial service will be held at 2pm on Saturday, April 28 at the Plainfield Meeting House of The Religious Society of Friends, 225 Watchung Ave., Plainfield, NJ 07060. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions in memory of Joseph to the above-listed Meeting, or to the FISH Hospitality Program, Inc., P.O. Box 170, Dunellen, NJ 08812, or to a charity of your choice."

Devoid of hardware, they rely on the simplicity of design and craftsmanship. Another status carryall, left, is marked with a Y for Yves Saint Laurent. The large bag dripping in fringe, below, is back; this time, it has nothing to do with the hippie era."

The woman was me -- I had seen my own reflection in a distant mirror and, for a split second, hadn't recognized myself. This moment of mistaken identity was disconcerting, but it wasn't all that unusual. Many of us are surprised by our size when reflected in the mirror or a store window -- it's like thinking that a recording of your own voice sounds off. And while psychologists have worried for years that media images of superslim starlets would put the nation's collective self-esteem at risk, it turns out that something altogether different has happened. As the population becomes fatter, study after study shows that instead of feeling bad about ourselves, we have entered a collective state of denial about how big we're actually getting."

Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson -- as well as key staff members like Andrew Hatcher. Garry Winogrand took pictures of all of them, but his primary interest was elsewhere. ''He photographed the life, the back corners, the audience,'' says Leo Rubinfien, a photographer who is curating a retrospective of Winogrand's work opening at SFMOMA next year. ''The people watching the parade, not the parade -- that was how he worked.'' The prolific Winogrand, who died in 1984 at 56 in Mexico, where he went for cancer treatment, left behind thousands of unseen pictures. Among them are these photographs, discovered last year in his archive at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson.

Sometimes the long tradition of street photography -- of capturing strangers as they move past the lens -- seems slightly lost in the shuffle of staged portraits, jaw-dropping panoramas of natural or urban vistas, or the latest permutations of postmodern setup. Some balance may be restored by ''I SPY: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE THEATER OF THE STREET, 1938-2010,'' a multigenerational examination of the work of six photographers that opens Sunday at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Contrasting different approaches and fluctuating ratios of control and randomness, it starts with Walker Evans, who used a hidden camera to photograph New York subway riders in 1938. It will include images from the 1950s that Harry Callahan made in Chicago, using a telephoto lens to snap pedestrians, and that Robert Frank took from buses of people on the sidewalks of New York. Bruce Davidson, revisiting the city's subways in the early 1980s, asked permission to take people's pictures. In the late '90s and 2000s Beat Streuli and Philip-Lorca diCorcia both set up stationary cameras on New York's streets, orchestrating memorable images of fluid choreographies and dark theatrics.

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"For travelers who want to use digital applications abroad but would like to avoid the outrageous post-vacation data charges, Lonely Planet has a solution. The company recently introduced a series of travel-guide apps for several countries that can be used offline. ''We found out early on that for leisure travelers, roaming is a really scary thing,'' said Jeremy Kreitler, Lonely Planet's vice president for Wireless Services. ''Everybody has a friend with a bad phone bill from traveling abroad.'' Apps for Italy, Ireland, Australia, France, Spain and Costa Rica can be downloaded to an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, from either the App Store or through the Lonely Planet Travel Guides app. Each guide is $9.99 and provides suggested itineraries, as well as practical and historical information about the country. Detailed maps allow you to find points anywhere in the country, using your device's GPS."

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"THE friendship of RALPH LEMON and Walter Carter must surely be counted as one of the great artistic collaborations of the early 21st century. Anyone who has encountered one of Mr. Lemon's layered artistic projects -- choreographic, visual or written -- is likely to be familiar with Mr. Carter (1907-2010), the Mississippi native who began showing up in Mr. Lemon's work in 2002 doing all sorts of strange, task-based activities (sometimes with his wife, Edna, and other relatives and neighbors). He was like a kind of marvelously inscrutable found object, one with as many schemes and designs in his head as Mr. Lemon had in his. Now, in ''1856 Cessna Road,'' Mr. Lemon delves into this eight-year relationship, in a solo show featuring large-scale color photographs, a video installation and 30 drawings made into video animation. It is Mr. Lemon's first exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the first time this collection of works is being shown in New York. It is not to be missed. Through May 27, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; $7 suggested donation."
2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"In the afterword to his latest novel, ''11/22/63,'' about John F. Kennedy's assassination, Stephen King calls Jack Finney ''one of America's great fantasists,'' and his book, ''Time and Again,'' ''the great time travel story.'' Thus, we would seem to have sufficient reason to make ''Time and Again'' our next book. Written in 1970, the novel revolves around the advertising artist Si Morley, who is recruited by the government to join a secretive operation committed to exploring the possibility of time travel. The project lands him in the New York of 1892, where, as a sidebar to his adventures, he has reason to trace the mystery of a half-destroyed letter for a friend.

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"TO spur the sales of hybrid, electric, diesel and biofuel-powered vehicles listed on its pages, eBay officially started Green Driving on Thursday, a site-within-a-site dedicated to high-efficiency cars, trucks and motorcycles. The idea came from eBay's sustainability group, led by Annie Lescroart, which was behind company initiatives to get sellers to recycle their old mobile phones and to reuse shipping boxes. But like those programs, Green Driving isn't merely a do-gooder project intended to burnish eBay's image, but an opportunity to reach more shoppers."
2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"WE know from a rare personal admission that Mitt Romney experienced a faint whiff of alcohol, a long, long time ago. ''I tasted a beer and tried a cigarette once as a wayward teenager,'' he said last November, ''and never tried it again.'' No doubt, Romney has friends who own multinational breweries. But he would fail the presidential beer test -- that is, whom would you most like to sip suds with -- simply because his Mormon faith prohibits drinking alcohol. But then, he would also fail the presidential cookie test, as he showed in another awkward appearance with real people last week."

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"IN ''My Week With Marilyn'' Eddie Redmayne -- freckled and plush lipped, with an undercurrent of naughty English schoolboy -- wore his infatuation on his sleeve as Colin Clark, a filmmaker recounting an intimate interlude with Marilyn Monroe in 1956. In ''BIRDSONG,'' the latest entry in the ''Masterpiece Classic'' oeuvre, Mr. Redmayne goes full-throttle romantic as Stephen Wraysford, a lieutenant in the British Army who, on the Allied front in 1916, barely seems to register the surrounding destruction as he remembers the summer of 1910 and his singular love, Isabelle Azaire (the clear-eyed Clémence Poésy). ''Birdsong'' is adapted from the 1993 novel by Sebastian Faulks, which, according to a recent BBC survey, ranks 13th -- between ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Rebecca'' -- on a list of Britain's best-loved books. Shown on PBS this Sunday and next at 9 p.m. (check local listings), the two-part dramatization cuts between the ochre-hued trenches of World War I and the sun-dappled woods of northern France as it chronicles the relationship of Stephen and Isabelle, the wife of a textile factory owner, from its fledgling stages, when the unintentional touching of feet reverberates with passion, to its startling demise."

2012-04-22T00:00:00Z,"IT'S been quite a year in movies for cults and the charismatic leaders who control them. Elizabeth Olsen played a damaged refugee from a group in ''Martha Marcy May Marlene,'' and the barely seen ''God's Land'' depicted a Texas commune waiting for a spaceship to deliver it to the promised, er, dimension. ''SOUND OF MY VOICE,'' perhaps the best of all, opens Friday in New York. A hot offering at the Sundance and South by Southwest festivals, the film, the debut feature of the director Zal Batmanglij, presents two journalists going undercover to investigate a mysterious order whose priestess, Maggie, claims to be from the future and requires blood transfusions from her disciples. Playing Maggie is the emerging multi-hyphenate Brit Marling, who, with Mr. Batmanglij, wrote the film and produced it. (She also starred in -- and helped write and produce -- ''Another Earth,'' an underseen indie from last summer.) Given the buzz, it's probably safe to expect Ms. Marling to command a devoted following of her own soon.

Kaplan Center for Jewish Peoplehood mourn the passing of our beloved Honorary Chairman, Rabbi Dr. Jack J. Cohen of Jerusalem, who died there on April 16 at the age of 93. The Jewish people have lost a giant of a teacher and a role model. One of Mordecai Kaplan's greatest and most devoted disciples, Jack was the foremost advocate in Israel for the Reconstructionist approach to Judaism for more than 50 years. Among many other accomplishments, Jack was a founder of Congregation Mevakshei Derech in Jerusalem and the creator of its Kaplan Center. A man of enormous talents and erudition, Jack also exemplified true humility and treated all human beings with respect and kindness. His tireless passion for continuing the work of his teacher Mordecai Kaplan was an inspiration to all of us. We will miss both Jack's intellectual leadership and the gentleness of his soul. Jack's memory will forever be a blessing. Eric Caplan Daniel Cedarbaum Mel Scult Jack Wolofsky"

It's safe to assume that many in fashion have scrutinized this film, set in the future and directed by Elio Petri and also starring Marcello Mastroianni. On the blog Irenebrination, Anna Battista dug out the movie's stylish facts, and noted a link to a fashion spread two years later in the Italian girlie magazine Playmen. You would swear the images are stills from the movie. She also supplied background on the costumes, designed by Giulio Coltellacci, writing, ''The tailor-made creations sported by Marcello are tempered by a sartorial and conceptual softness, making him look like a bored futuristic dandy.''

2012-04-23T00:00:00Z,"2:30 P.M. (HBO2) SEPARATE LIES (2005) In this directorial debut from Julian Fellowes (''Downton Abbey''), who adapted the screenplay from Nigel Balchin's novel ''A Way Through the Wood,'' Tom Wilkinson portrays James Manning, a London lawyer who spares no one his imperious authority, not even his wife, Anne (Emily Watson, above with Mr. Wilkinson). When the husband of their cleaning woman is killed in a hit-and-run accident, James suspects that Bill Bule (Rupert Everett), a family acquaintance who attended a party at the Mannings' home that evening, was driving the car. Then Anne confesses that she and Bill are having an affair -- and that she was behind the wheel. But instead of allowing her to go to the police, James constructs an alibi. ''This powerful performance, equal in stature to Mr. Wilkinson's grieving father in 'In the Bedroom,' pushes 'Separate Lies' halfway toward the rarefied class of that 2001 film,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''But that's not nearly far enough to begin to lift this intriguing but chilly moral puzzle to anything close to greatness.'' 9 A.M.

McGovern; and the journalist Bill Moyers in this two-hour report, culled from a symposium presented last month by the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and presenting a speech in 1965 before a joint session of Congress. The program will be repeated a 3 and 9 p.m."

He declared, aides recalled, that the administration needed to more aggressively use executive power to govern in the face of Congressional obstructionism.

''The president expressed frustration, saying we have got to scour everything and push the envelope in finding things we can do on our own.''"
2012-04-23T00:00:00Z,"The No. 1 movie in North America over the weekend, and by a long shot (sorry, Zac Efron), came as a shock to the movie industry: ''Think Like a Man,'' a low-budget ensemble comedy aimed at African-American audiences, took in an estimated $33 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. Sony spent less than $13 million to make this film, which is based on Steve Harvey's book ''Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man'' and features the comedian Kevin Hart. A vehicle for Mr. Efron, ''The Lucky One'' (Warner Brothers), was second with about $22.8 million in ticket sales. Mr. Efron has been struggling to transition from ''High School Musical'' heartthrob to grown-up movie star, and ''The Lucky One,'' based on a Nicholas Sparks novel, was seen as an easy way for him to score. While the film missed No. 1, it had a bigger opening weekend than some industry analysts had predicted. It cost about $25 million to make, and Mr. Sparks's weepy dramas (this is the seventh to make it to the big screen) tend to have box-office staying power."

2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,"SEATTLE - A plan by Facebook to acquire a broad range of patents through a deal with Microsoft is on its surface yet another twist in the battles over intellectual property engulfing the tech business. But the subtext of the deal is a different story, showing how two of technology's most powerful players are teaming up to create a greater balance of power on the Internet - a market that has been tilted decisively in favor of one company, Google, for years. ''This is almost certainly a move against Google,'' said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst at Altimeter Group, a research firm. The agreement between Microsoft and Facebook, announced on Monday, came less than two weeks after Microsoft agreed to pay more than $1 billion for 925 patents held by AOL. In a second deal, Microsoft said it had turned around and sold 70 percent of those same patents - about 650 in all - to Facebook for $550 million in cash, along with rights to 275 AOL patents Microsoft plans to retain. While Facebook and Microsoft have not yet determined precisely how they are going to divvy up the patents, it is expected that Facebook will end up with a range of patents involving mobile, Web and instant messaging technologies. Microsoft is likely to keep AOL patents involving search, among other things. The arrangement will help Facebook bulk up its intellectual property portfolio before its ini tial public offering, which is expected next month, and it is a further sign of the growing importance of stockpiling patents in the arsenal of any big technology company. ''This is another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests over the long term,'' Ted Ullyot, general counsel of Facebook, said in a statement. The deal could also give Facebook additional ammunition in its escalating patent feud with Yahoo. Yahoo sued Facebook earlier this year, claiming violations of Yahoo patents, many related to online advertising. Facebook subsequently countersued Yahoo, in a pattern that is playing out again and again in different parts of the technology business, especially the mobile phone market. But in large part the deal is evidence of how Microsoft and Facebook have gravitated ever closer to each other in part because of a common enemy, Google. Google has menaced Microsoft's business on a number of fronts, including with free online Google applications that compete with Microsoft Office and with Android, a mobile operating system that competes with Microsoft's Windows Phone software. As Facebook has evolved into a Web behemoth, with 900 million active monthly users, Google has become increasingly focused on tamping down the challenge to its business from the social network, introducing Google Plus, a rival social service. Google's big concern is that the bounty of data Facebook has about its users, including their tastes and friend connections, will turn it into a serious rival for online advertising dollars. There is also wide speculation that Facebook will start its own Internet search engine to rival Google. ''Microsoft is simply less concerned about the threat of social to its business than Google is,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, explaining why Microsoft is not concerned about competition with Facebook. ''This may be a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend,'' he added. Jim Prosser, a Google spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft has spent the last several years forging deeper connections with Facebook at every turn. Long stymied in its efforts to create an Internet search engine that effectively competed against Google, Microsoft two years ago struck a deal with Facebook to use data from the social network in Microsoft's Bing search engine to create more relevant search results. But the arrangement has not helped dislodge Google from its position of supremacy in Internet search. Years before that, Microsoft tried to acquire Facebook, but the social network's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, rebuffed the offer. Those conversations subsequently led to Microsoft's taking a small stake in Facebook, from which it stands to profit handsomely after the company goes public. In March, Google accounted for 66.4 percent of Internet searches in the United States, unchanged from the same month a year earlier, while Microsoft was in second place with 15.3 percent of the market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing search engine also supplies search results for Yahoo, which accounted for 13.7 percent of the search market during March. Microsoft has continued to lose money on Bing, including more than $2.6 billion in operating losses for its online division during its last fiscal year. Some executives within Microsoft have advocated selling Bing to another company, with the idea that a company better focused on the Internet market could pose a more credible challenge to Google, according to severalpeople with knowledge of the discussions who didn't want to be identified talking about internal deliberations.Over a year ago, Microsoft executives sent out feelers to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in acquiring Bing, though the overture was not officially sanctioned by Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, one of these people said. Mr. Zuckerberg declined, saying Facebook had too much else to concentrate on. Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to comment, as did Ashley Zandy, a spokeswoman for Facebook. In its original patent deal with AOL, Microsoft either bought or won the ability to assign about 925 patents and patent applications, along with a license to several hundred other patents AOL did not sell as part of an auction of its intellectual property. If the deal announced Monday clears regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft would still own about 275 AOL patents and retain a license to the 650 patents that Facebook will own. In addition, Microsoft is granting Facebook a license to the 275 AOL patents that it is keeping. Yahoo's legal attack on Facebook came at a sensitive time, as the company nears an expected initial public offering. In a statement, Yahoo said the deal with Microsoft will not deter its lawsuit against Facebook. ''Nothing about today's action changes the fact that Facebook continues to infringe our patents,'' Yahoo said in the statement. ''Companies who purchase patents are often working from a position of weakness and take these actions to strengthen their portfolio. We see today's announcement as a validation of our case against Facebook.'' The deal with Facebook puts Microsoft in an awkward position since it could help strengthen one close partner at the expense of another, Yahoo. ''We are very sensitive to the importance of our relationship with both Facebook and Yahoo,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel said in an interview. ''We have enormous respect for the value of the Yahoo patent portfolio. Yahoo has been an important innovator in the Internet space.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

2012-04-24T00:00:00Z,"WILLIAMSON--Benjamin Robert, Jr.,a resident of Manhattan, died in an automobile accident at Figure Eight Island, NC on April 22. Born September 18, 1956, in Raleigh NC, Robert is survived by his mother, Blanche Bacon, and father, Robert, both of Raleigh, and by his wife of 24 years, Caroline Crook Williamson and their three children: Caroline Costner, age 20; Benjamin Robert III, 18, and Wyndham Josephine, 13. Robert had an abiding interest in people of all ages and stations, loved to probe questions both big and small, and was gifted with a sunny magnetism that attracted many friends. He had a soft spot for his family. To be a close friend meant steady bombardment with e-mails about his children, usually with a selection of the photographs and videos he was always taking on family trips, at sports events and at class plays. From childhood, Robert had a keen interest in business and started many enterprises, most famously, in his preteen years, a rabbit farm. Robert graduated from the Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, where he was the 2008 distinguished alumnus and a member of its sports hall of fame, and in 1979 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Following graduation, he worked for Sonoco, a paper products company in Hartsville, SC, before going to Wake Forest School of Business and receiving an MBA with honors in 1983. Later that year, he joined Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in Manhattan as a stockbroker. In 1998 he joined Tiger Management, a New York City fund. In 2000 he co-founded his own hedge fund, Williamson McAree Investments, and, in January of 2011, joined Chilton Investment Co. where at his death he was a managing director. As a New Yorker, Robert maintained his ties to the South, hosting a Christmas party with Caroline where Southern accents predominated, and attending the annual ball of the North Carolina Society of New York, where he served a term as president. Robert played junior varsity basketball for Carolina, and he remained an avid Tar Heel fan. He gave time and money to many New York charities, including New Life of New York City, a faith-based youth outreach organization, where he was chairman of the board at his death, and Inwood House, where Caroline plays a leadership role. He was a longtime member of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, and at the time of his death was chairing the search for a new pastor. In addition to the family members mentioned above, Robert is survived by his sister Blanche Spencer Williamson of Southampton NY; brother Julian Robertson Williamson of Raleigh, wife Elizabeth and their three daughters; stepfather Zack Bacon; stepbrothers, Zack Bacon, Louis Bacon, and Bart Bacon; stepmother, Eve Williamson; stepbrothers Bill Blades and Rob Blades and stepsister Helen Dixon; mother- and father-in-law Betty and C.B. Crook of Albemarle, NC; brother-in-law Charles Crook of Marina del Rey, CA; uncle, Julian Robertson of New York City; aunt, Wyndham Robertson of Chapel Hill, and many beloved first cousins with whom he was in regular contact. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, April 25th at 5:00pm at Christ Episcopal Church in Raleigh. The funeral will be held on Monday, April 30th, at 4:00pm at the Church of the Heavenly Rest at 90th Street and Fifth Avenue. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, a contribution be made to New Life of New York City, 66 Clinton Street, New York City, 10002, to the Church of the Heavenly Rest, 2 E. 90th Street, New York City, 10128, or to the charity of one's choice."

(13, 49) MONEY, POWER AND WALL STREET In the summer of 1994, in a luxury hotel in Boca Raton, Fla., a team of JP Morgan bankers in their 20's devised an insurance product for loans called a credit default swap, and in the process fueled a golden era of profits for the banking industry. But what was originally intended to stabilize the financial system eventually brought it to its knees, inciting protests, above. ''It was quite clear to me that a number of really quite large financial systems had not had the kind of management information systems which allowed them even to know what all their risks were,'' Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor, said later. In this two-episode ''Frontline'' presentation, Martin Smith and Michael Kirk investigate the efforts in Washington and on Wall Street to rescue the economy and explore how certain decisions, missed opportunities and the uneasy partnership between government leaders and the titans of finance have affected fortunes worldwide.

Those images found their way into his 1907 painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' This documentary from Arne Glimcher argues that films, starting with the early experiments of Thomas Edison and the Lumière brothers, were a formative influence on Modern painting, especially Cubism, which was founded by Picasso and Braque in 1907.

He graduated Georgetown University in 1948 and earned his medical degree from the Medical College of Virginia in 1953. He completed his internship and residency in Internal Medicine in 1955 at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, after which he was a submarine medical officer with the U.S. Navy in Key West, FL. He began a general surgery residency in 1958 at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center in New York followed by specialty training in orthopedic surgery, which he completed in 1962. He went on to become Associate Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at New York University School of Medicine where he was actively involved in surgery, education, and research. He was a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha and Sigma Zeta Honorary Scientific Societies and received the Kappa Delta Award for outstanding basic research related to orthopedic surgery in 1970. Academic medicine and research became his primary interests and, in 1976, he was appointed Professor of Orthopedic Surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Director of the Orthopedic Research Laboratories at Montefiore Medical Center. He became president of the Orthopedic Research Society in 1981 and received several awards for outstanding achievement in orthopedic research during his lifetime.

It has no wish, apparently, to be known for an unscheduled fisticuffs session: a knock-down, drag-out, coed brawl that unfolded at the club's Tap Room in the wee hours of April 13 and ended with two people sent to the hospital and three men under arrest."

Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, said on Tuesday that he would release his personal tax returns from the last six years and challenged Elizabeth Warren, his presumed Democratic opponent, to do the same. The candidates have been sparring over tax policy, with Ms. Warren saying that the nation's wealthiest households should be taxed at higher rates, and Mr. Brown countering that raising taxes only increases government spending. Last week, amid the back and forth, The Boston Globe asked both to release six years' worth of tax returns."

Mark sought to capture happiness regardless of the circumstance. What others might have found unattainable, Mark grasped with ease. He treated every individual with equal respect, whether they were the caddies at his golf club or the CEO of a major company. In return, he was loved and special to everyone that had ever known him. They don't make Zionist, patriotic, friendly, down to earth, generous individuals like Mark anymore. He was one of a kind. I will never forget him taking the Israeli Ethiopian students in carts through the Palm Beach Country Club, as if they owned the place, and the caddies and the hired help could not figure out who these VIP's were. He took on challenges of personal best. He loved to run in the New York City marathon. He won golf tournaments, and even with impaired vision, he became an accomplished race car driver. When the doctor told him about the ocular melanoma, Mark said, ""I have more to live for than to die for"". This was his mantra. A triumph of the human spirit! For Mark, ""there were only good days and not such good days"". We shall miss his essence. The true caring and love we both had for him will endure forever. This incredible man and his magnificent love of life, and solid allegiance to friendship are irreplaceable. Bonnie and Steven Stern"

2012-04-26T00:00:00Z,"The Philadelphia Orchestra said on Tuesday that it had settled a dispute with its musicians' national pension fund, calling the agreement a ''critical step'' in its effort to emerge from bankruptcy court. The orchestra agreed to pay $1.75 million to the American Federation of Musicians and Employers' Pension Fund, it said, in exchange for the fund's dropping its claims against the orchestra. The orchestra had withdrawn from the fund, prompting the fund to say that it was owed $35 million as a consequence. That was one of the demands dropped under the agreement, the orchestra said. The orchestra filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, in part to reduce its pension burden. The Philadelphia Orchestra's withdrawal from the national pension caused concern among other orchestras, who felt the move could weaken the fund. The fund challenged the terms of some donations to the orchestra, arguing that orchestra management could have used them for pension obligations but claimed it could not. The orchestra said on Tuesday that the agreement also solved that problem."

After the free app is installed, you can try a sample training battle with no plane required. But that's not how WowWee gets paid. The fun stuff, like taking out that battleship floating by your lamp, or trying to dive bomb a bunker, requires scanning the wing of a plane. This unlocks one of six the missions, each based loosely on historical WWII battles. Besides being fun and addicting, it's a great way to get very dizzy.

But the promise of video calling has never matched its lackluster market acceptance. As users of Google Voice, Skype and other Internet-based video calling products know, unless you're willing to pony up large sums of money for professional videoconferencing gear, picture quality can range from decent to crummy, depending on the speed of the connection. That's true whether you're sitting in front of your computer, or using a webcam with a Skype-compatible HDTV."

The caps caught our attention on last fall's Miu Miu runway, worn slightly askew, and they popped up again for spring, in leather at Victoria Beckham, in sunny prints at Karen Walker (above). But it was on the street, during the last round of fashion shows, when several women to watch, like Leaf Greener of Elle China (top right) and the blogger Hedvig Opshaug (top left, in Miu Miu), were snapped in the caps, that the look gained legs. ''I don't think it necessarily has anything to do with the athletic 'sporty' trend,'' said Michelle Reneau, the market director at Nylon, who wore a Bill Blass ball cap emblazoned with a gold anchor. ''It's a new way to play down something overly femme.'' For spring, she suggests wearing one with a serious piece, like a pencil skirt, to make the look more playful.

2012-04-26T00:00:00Z,"In a signal that NBC and the show's producers may believe the future of ''Smash'' lies more in its soap opera elements than its inside look at the creation of a Broadway musical, the new guiding creative hand on the series is going to be Joshua Safran, an executive producer of the glossy CW soap ''Gossip Girl.'' NBC confirmed Wednesday that Mr. Safran is the choice to replace Theresa Rebeck as the hands-on executive producer - also known as show runner - of the second season of ''Smash.'' Because the deal to secure Mr. Safran has not closed, NBC is offering no comment about the direction the network may have in mind for ''Smash,'' which has bounced from critical favorite to something of a critical punching bag in its first season. NBC, which still believes strongly in the potential for the series, announced last month that it was renewing ''Smash'' for a second season, and followed that up almost immediately with the news that Ms. Rebeck, a playwright (her ''Seminar'' is still on Broadway), was departing as the show runner on the series."

2012-04-26T00:00:00Z,"LAS VEGAS - If the pressure is on Pixar to prove that its creative spark remains intact after the critical crash that was ''Cars 2,'' then the Disney-owned animation studio appears to be rising to the challenge. In a presentation to theater owners here on Monday, John Lasseter, Pixar's chief creative officer (and the director of ''Cars 2''), said the studio has added a movie about the Mexican holiday Día de los Muertos to its slate. The film, which does not yet have a title or a release date, will be directed by Lee Unkrich, who won an Oscar for ''Toy Story 3.'' Mr. Lasseter gave no additional details, but did show a colorful (early) logo with skulls and Mexican marigolds. Pixar likes to keep details of its upcoming movies close to its vest, partly because of competitive concerns; a typical Pixar film takes four years to complete. But Mr. Lasseter did dole out a few more morsels: a previously announced movie pondering what would happen if dinosaurs never became extinct got a title -- ''The Good Dinosaur'' -- and a release date of May 2014; and the next (still untitled) film from Pete Docter (''Up'') will debut in June 2015 and will still take audiences on a journey inside the human mind as previously disclosed.

But one Broadway musical has been having a good run with its new leading lady. ''Sister Act'' has been performing far better at the box office since the former child star Raven-Symoné took over the lead role of Deloris Van Cartier on March 27. Now 13 months into its Broadway run, ''Sister Act'' had modest ticket sales at points last fall and then some dreadful winter weeks. No one was blaming its star at the time, Patina Miller, who received a Tony nomination as best actress in a musical last year, and it is too soon to say if Raven, as she is known, has stabilized ticket sales for the long haul."

2012-04-26T00:00:00Z,"DOTY--Sr. George Espy 94, Wall St. Legend, retired Partner of Goldman Sachs & Co., former Partner of Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery, veteran of World War II, leading Catholic philanthropist, humanitarian, mentor, cancer survivor, heart attack survivor, miracle worker, longest living Doty of his lineage, devoted husband of the late Marie Doty, beloved father, grandfather, great grandfather, brother and uncle, of Rye, NY, Naples, FL and formerly of Smith's Parish, Bermuda died peacefully at home surrounded by his family on April 24, 2012 after a long illness. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. Born in Manhattan, George was the 4th of 6 children of Dr. George E. Doty and Lillian Gertrude (Bergen). He graduated from Collegiate School in 1934, received a B.S. from Fordham University in 1938 and an M.S. from Columbia University in 1939. He began his career in 1936 working nights as a clerk for the City of New York Department of Sanitation. After graduating from Columbia, he joined Price Waterhouse. His career continued at General Motors before he enlisted to serve in the Navy in 1942. Upon his return from the War, he joined Richards & Ganley before eventually joining Lybrand. He became a senior partner there before joining a client firm, Goldman Sachs in November 1964 as a general partner. He retired and became a ""Limited Partner"" in November of 1984. He had an extraordinary professional career filled with accomplishment, but he was most proud of his philanthropy, largely inspired by the example of his mentor Gustave Levy, whom he often said was the most generous man he knew. His loyalty and generosity to his family, business partners and friends was unmatched. He served as a trustee of Fordham University from 1971-1980, as Chairman from 1977-1980 and was honored to be considered their most consistent donor. He was the President of the Collegiate School Board Of Trustees from 1972-1977. He was a Director of Foundations & Donors Interested in Catholic Activities (FADICA). He was a former Chairman of the Board of St. Vincent's Hospital. He was a founding member of the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) and served as Chairman from 1987-1993. George, a descendant of Edward Doty who came to the United States on the Mayflower, served as Governor of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of New York and as President of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York (1967-69). He served as Lieutenant of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem Eastern Lieutenancy. He was a Knight of the Order of Malta. He received an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Laws) from Fordham University in 1981 and from Adamson University (Doctor of Humane Letters) in 1994. He will be best remembered for his 63-year marriage to Marie Doty (Ward) who died in 2008. He was a doting and loving husband providing exemplary care particularly during the later stages of her life. He is survived by all of his adoring children, Anne Marie (C. Lawrence) Paine of Fairfield, CT, Barbara Doty of Sag Harbor, NY, Virginia Doty of NYC, George (Le-ellen Spelman) Doty, Jr. of NYC and William (Jana Hale) Doty of Harrison, NY, 16 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren with another due in July. He is also survived by his loving sister, Joan (Peter) O'Rourke, Palm Springs, CA and 17 nieces and nephews. The family will receive friends on Sunday, April 29th from 12-6 PM at Graham Funeral Home, 1036 Boston Post Rd., Rye, NY. A Mass of Christian Burial will be offered at the Church of the Resurrection, 910 Boston Post Rd., Rye, NY on Monday, April 30th at 11am. In lieu of flowers, friends are strongly encouraged to make donations in his memory to either Asian Relief, Inc., 180 Admiral Cochrane Blvd., Suite 240, Annapolis, MD 21401 or Catholic Near East Welfare Association, 1011 First Ave., New York, NY 10022."

The film, directed by Gore Verbinski (''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' ''Rango''), stars Johnny Depp as Tonto and Armie Hammer as John Reid and is set for release on May 31, 2013. The score will mark the first time Mr. White, known for his arch and minimalist garage rock, will do an entire score, though he and Alicia Keys wrote and performed the theme song for the 2008 James Bond movie ''Quantum of Solace.'' He also sang several traditional songs, including ''Wayfaring Stranger,'' for the score to ''Cold Mountain.''

He got his Medical degree at the University of Modena in Italy; he came to the U.S in the early 60's and practiced for over 40 years in both Brooklyn and Manhattan, with H.I.P. and the Board of Education. He was loved by his patients, staff and colleagues. The essence of Dr. Boeri's angelic nature was evidenced by his generosity such that he would often be referred to as Santa Clause by the children around him. Although he was a Pediatrician, Boeri was also a patron to the Arts. As a member of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, he was often a guest of many of the artists such as world famous singers Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti, whom he met in Modena, Italy during the infant stages of their careers. He had a particular love for Opera and for his own enjoyment he would study the voices of famous singers and ""not so famous"" and discuss their techniques with his circle of friends. Boeri's love for this Art form was deepened by his close relationships to the singers who graced the Operatic stages from the 1950's until the 2000's. The world of Opera and the singers loved him back. Dr. Boeri was a special spirit in this world, he was able to see beauty in everything and his legacy will live on... in the world's beauty. Dr. Umberto Boeri will be laid to rest on Saturday, April 28, 2012 at 12:00pm at the Trinity Church Cemetery on Riverside Drive and 153rd Street, New York City. Condolences may be sent to: Ulises and Celina Espaillat, 10 Kirkbridge Court, Marlton New Jersey, 08053.

The family moved to Brooklyn, where Anne attended public schools. She went on to graduate first in her class from the School of Dental Hygiene at Howard University in 1938, serving as class speaker.

2012-04-27T00:00:00Z,"Early in Raymond De Felitta's documentary of the 1960s-era South, ''Booker's Place: A Mississippi Story,'' a couple of tales are quickly told about black men who were shot or beaten for their transgressions against whites: one for inadvertently brushing his mop against a woman's foot, another for touching someone's car. The anecdotes lay down the law as it stood shortly before the time Booker Wright, a black waiter, made the fateful decision to explain to a documentary crew for NBC News not only what he served white customers but also how he felt about their varied treatment of him. He was beaten for his brave, conscientious honesty, and his own business (the Booker's Place of the title) was torched. Mr. De Felitta's moody, well-rounded film (which is also playing in the Tribeca Film Festival) is a kind of excavation and investigation of Mr. Wright's actions as a piece of civil rights history."

2012-04-27T00:00:00Z,"BOSTIAN--Barry, retired educational publishing executive, died of lung cancer Monday, April 22, at his home in Orlando, FL. He was 71. He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Donaline Jordan Bostian of Orlando; two children, daughter Beth Bostian of Richmond, VA, and son Matthew Adam Bostian of Orlando; and sister Betty Boliek of Augusta, GA. Born in Concord, NC, on August 27, 1940, Barry was the son of Herman C. and Helen O. Bostian of nearby Kannapolis, NC. He graduated from A.L. Brown High School in Kannapolis in 1958 and from what is now Lenoir-Rhyne University in Hickory, NC, in 1961. That same year he married Donaline Jordan of Kannapolis. He began his career in 1961 teaching English at Concord High School. After completing his master's degree at the University of North Carolina, he continued teaching at what is now Pfeiffer University in Misenheimer, NC. His special literary interest was the American novel, and his favorite authors were Mark Twain, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and others who wrote to communicate rather than obfuscate. His favorite novel was Twain's Huckleberry Finn, which he felt was, for those who read between the lines, the most powerful argument against slavery and racial prejudice ever written. In 1967, he joined publisher Harcourt Brace & World, which was about to launch a highly innovative grammar textbook series for elementary and junior high schools. He remained at Harcourt for 36 years, serving in various management and administrative capacities. In the early 1980s, just as computer technology was beginning to impact schools, he was named Vice President and Director of Technology Marketing. He retired from Harcourt in 2003 and worked as a part-time representative for the Command Group of Printing Companies, based in Secaucus, NJ. He was an avid golfer and author of The Fairly Official NESH Guide To Great Golf Games, a privately published book distributed to friends and members of the Noble and Exalted Society of Hackers, a golf club he co-founded. He was interested in birds and indulged his passion for plants by fastidiously caring for a collection of orchids amassed over three decades. A celebration of his life will be held at the family home in Orlando on May 4, 2012. In lieu of flowers, please consider planting a tree or shrub with Barry in mind or making a donation to the Orange Audubon Society at www.orangeaudubonfl.org."

Instead she cut off ties with Sean's biological father, David Goldman (above, with Sean), divorced him and married a lawyer from a prominent family while keeping her son in Brazil. When Sean was 8, Ms. Bianchi died after childbirth, and his stepfather moved to adopt him. This forced Mr. Goldman to fight for Sean's return and set off an international case that lasted until father and son were reunited on Christmas Eve 2009. Sean, now 11, speaks here with Meredith Vieira in his first interview. 8 A.M. (IFC) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) In 1995 Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French fashion magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke that left him with a condition called locked-in syndrome, in which he retained vision, hearing and a perfectly functioning mind but was left almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this third feature film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Céline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Josée Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. ''The phrase 'triumph of the human spirit' hovers over 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,' along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichés,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, he added, Mr. Schnabel ''demonstrates his own imaginative freedom in every frame and sequence, dispensing with narrative and expository conventions in favor of a wild, intuitive honesty.''"

2012-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Mitt Romney effectively wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. Newt Gingrich said he would drop out. President Obama stumped through key swing states. But there's a case to be made that the developments this week with the greatest long-term meaning for American politics took place across the Atlantic, not in Washington or New Hampshire or Iowa. In Britain, the economy lapsed into a double-dip recession, a result in part of a strict fiscal austerity plan imposed by the conservative government. And political tremors swept across the Continent as the European Union engaged in a fierce battle over whether Germany is demanding excessively deep budget cuts in the effort to keep debtor countries from financial collapse."

2012-04-28T00:00:00Z,"The conductor Kurt Masur, 84, is said to be in good condition in a Paris hospital after having fallen off the podium and into the audience last night while leading the Orchestre National de France at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. The fall occurred during the second and final work on the program, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 (''Pathétique''), in the midst of the third movement, ''Allegro molto vivace.'' Mr. Masur's assistant, Stefana Atlas, said that the fall resulted from an accident rather than his increasingly frail physical condition, which has led him to cancel some performances in recent months. ''Even though he has a railing at the back of the podium,'' Ms. Atlas said in a telephone interview, ''he didn't realize his left foot was close to the left edge and he fell behind into the audience, hitting his shoulder.'' Ms. Atlas said that Mr. Masur remained conscious and was taken to the hospital, where X-rays and other scans showed no major injuries or broken bones. She said that he would probably be released after another day or two of observation. Mr. Masur, who was the music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1991 to 2002 and is the honorary music director of the Orchestre National de France, is next scheduled to conduct the Dresden Philharmonic in Beethoven's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies on May 5 and 6. Ms. Atlas said that no decision had yet been made about whether Mr. Masur would be able to keep that engagement."

Julia Roberts, above with Mr. Hanks, is the community college speech teacher with a morning margarita problem who gives him the opportunity to quote the wise words of George Bernard Shaw. Naturally an extracurricular relationship ensues with a little help from Larry's scooter and a tough-girl classmate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who invites him to join her motorbike ''gang.''

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"It has long been pointed out that middle- and working-class voters are influenced by politicians pushing social issues to vote against their economic interests. Some progressives now seem to be elevating a social issue -- gay marriage -- over issues of economic justice. As important an issue as gay marriage may be, it is distressing to see the vote for gay marriage by Senator Mark Grisanti of New York, who is described as ''a budding star by most Conservative measures,'' viewed as a basis to assist his re-election. Whatever good was accomplished by his vote for gay marriage will be outweighed by his giving the Republicans control of the Senate, thereby advancing their agenda on issues like minimum wage, income tax, health care, public education and fracking.

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"IF today's book publishers were interested in critical takes on the theater, I would propose someone write a consideration of the modern genre of plays about teachers and students. It's a vast, fertile field. Consider the diversity in this incomplete list: ''The History Boys,'' ''Seminar,'' ''Comedians,'' ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' ''Oleanna'' and ''Miss Margarida's Way.'' These are often bruising plays about power, race and gender that are distinctly talky. That has long been one of the main criticisms of Athol Fugard's ''MY CHILDREN! MY AFRICA!,'' being revived at the Signature Theater. The 1989 drama, set in apartheid-era South Africa, centers on an argument about the best way to dissent. The idealistic teacher and his more radical student trade monologues in this passionate play of ideas. In his New York Times review Frank Rich described the prose as ''pedagogical.'' At the same time the play is self-consciously about the power of words, and the right production can fill in the emotional core of these verbose characters. The director of this new production, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, has staged August Wilson plays, so his experience with long monologues may come in handy.

Given this brief description, most of us will think of a human person, some will associate it with an animal, and virtually no one's imagination will conjure up a plant. Since Nov. 2, however, one possible answer to the riddle is Pisumsativum, a species colloquially known as the common pea. On that day, a team of scientists from the Blaustein Institute for Desert Research at Ben-Gurion University in Israel published the results of its peer-reviewed research, revealing that a pea plant subjected to drought conditions communicated its stress to other such plants, with which it shared its soil. In other words, through the roots, it relayed to its neighbors the biochemical message about the onset of drought, prompting them to react as though they, too, were in a similar predicament."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"DURING the Victorian Era, the leather industry boomed in Bermondsey, a London neighborhood on the south bank of the Thames, and over time, it evolved into an antiquing destination. But, despite its central location, neglect set in during the late 1900s. ''I never felt very safe, and Bermondsey Street was particularly rough,'' said Tamasin Hopkins, a personal assistant and area resident, referring to her early years in the neighborhood, where she moved in 2000. Now, she said, ''I would describe it as really vibrant, and I feel very plugged in to London living here.'' The Spanish chef José Pizarro, formerly of Brindisa restaurant in Borough Market, has clearly taken notice: He opened José, a tapas and sherry bar, there last summer and the more upscale Pizarro a few doors down in December. Bermondsey also sits in the shadow of the Shard (below right), a 95-story skyscraper with an unveiling planned for 2013, which promises to attract still more attention to the neighborhood.

When you see it and the word ''curated'' together, you know you are in the general area of a taste-shifting experiment: the bridging of conservatory training and trebly electric guitars; string quartets and post-Velvet Underground eighth-note stomps. On the basis of that aesthetic Bryce founded the MusicNOW festival in Cincinnati in 2006 and helped program the Big Ears festival in Knoxville, Tenn., in 2010.

It was the cover image of the show's catalog and hung alongside the record-breaking ''Triptych.'' ''It was such a popular show they had to close off the street,'' said Mr. Meyer, who added that this painting is creating considerable buzz. One reason is that it has not been on the market for 35 years. Another is the painting itself, with the hypnotic reflections of the man in the mirror and on the floor."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"FOR nearly six decades this watercolor, depicting Paulin Paulet, a gardener on Cézanne's family estate near Aix-en-Provence, France, was familiar to scholars only as a black-and-white photograph. No one knew if the actual work, a study for Cézanne's celebrated Card Players paintings, still existed and if it did, who owned it. But it recently resurfaced, and the Dallas collector who had it in his home is selling it on Tuesday. Cézanne's images of workers on his farm -- pipe-smoking men sitting around a table, their expressions dour, absorbed in a game of cards -- are among his most recognizable work. Executed from 1890 to 1896, they were the artist's take on genre paintings made famous by 17th-century Dutch masters. Although not as instantly recognizable as ''The Scream,'' the watercolor is considered an art historical landmark, but one that will most likely appeal to the connoisseur collector rather than a speculator or a trophy hunter."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"THE diverting drama of sports had never collided with the drama of real life quite the way it did in 1936, when Jesse Owens ran and jumped his way to Olympic glory in the heart of Nazi Germany. That achievement of course receives plenty of attention in ''JESSE OWENS,'' the ''American Experience'' episode being broadcast on PBS on Tuesday night. (Check local listings.) A black man winning four gold medals was certainly not in Hitler's plans when he agreed to let his deputies make an international showcase out of the Summer Olympics, which had been assigned to Berlin before Hitler came to power. He expected Aryan domination. With his victories Owens grabbed international attention. The program, though, is at its most compelling when it explores how quickly he lost it. After clashing with the Amateur Athletic Union, Owens was soon reduced to racing against horses to make a buck. Then, as now, fame could be cruelly fleeting, even for those whose accomplishments made a statement heard round the world."
2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"D'URSO--Florence B. Calvary Hospital and Calvary Fund mourn with great sadness the passing of our munificent benefactor and Calvary Fund Board Trustee Emerita, Florence B. D'Urso. Florence was a devout daughter of the Church, and an extraordinary philanthropist. She joined the Calvary Fund Board in 1986, and through the years remained a tireless advocate for the Hospital's patients, families, caregivers, and leadership. She and her late husband, Camillo, were devoted to Calvary, and the Hospital's Florence and Camillo D'Urso Patient Activities Center, where hundreds of patients and families enjoy concerts and holiday celebrations every year, honors their outstanding generosity. In recognition of the D'Ursos' concern for the dignity of human life and service to humanity, in 1987 Calvary presented the Calvary Medal, the Hospital's highest tribute, to Florence and, posthumously, to Camillo. Florence commissioned the Compatior sculpture in 1999, in observance of Calvary's centennial, and in memory of her son, David Francis, and brother, Father Francis Joseph Perkosky, SS, both lost to cancer. Today, the Compatior is the essential symbol of Calvary's compassionate and comprehensive care. Florence will be remembered for her love and knowledge of architecture and art, her life of grace in the face of sorrow, and her deep and abiding faith. We extend our sincere condolences to her daughters Donna and Lisa, her son, Mark, her daughter-in-law, Michelle, her treasured and beloved granddaughter, Michaela Frances, and the entire D'Urso family.

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"There was a phase I went through -- I was 6 or 7 -- when I would get home from school, race upstairs and close my door. I'd don one of my dad's jackets -- I preferred a gray pinstripe -- balance his glasses on my snub nose and shuffle around in his wingtips. Then I would organize piles of papers on my desk. When the mood struck, I'd pretend to read The Wall Street Journal. If my mother came up to check on me, I'd shout, ''Not now, Mom! I'm working!'' Even better than playing ''Office'' was the real thing. My dad was a mutual fund manager, and his office felt like Cheers: a place where everyone knew my name. The traders would high-five me and teach me the occasional curse word. Dad's secretary, Louise, let me sit at her desk. Sometimes, I would color in stock charts. (''This makes it easier for me to read,'' Dad would say, approvingly.)"

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"ESTATE property is especially desirable in part because it has generally been off the market for years and comes with reasonable estimates. This canvas, from 1941, is one of 17 works being sold on Wednesday from the estate of Theodore J. Forstmann, the New York financier who died in November. Painted in the early years of World War II, the distorted figure of Dora Maar, Picasso's muse and lover, posed in a chair is one of scores of seated women whom he depicted. ''The anguish of the war and his relationship with Dora, which was deteriorating, is reflected in these paintings,'' said John Richardson, the Picasso biographer. ''He painted Dora in such an angular way, she almost looks like a pair of scissors.'' The painting was made the same year as Picasso's ''Dora Maar With Cat,'' a far more dramatic canvas with a black cat perched on Maar's shoulder that sold for $95.2 million at Sotheby's in 2006."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"THE Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose ''Once Upon a Time in Anatolia'' shared the 2011 grand prize at Cannes, has become an auteur hero. But beyond Mr. Ceylan most American moviegoers probably have little experience with Turkish movies. That makes the 29-film series ''THE SPACE BETWEEN: A PANORAMA OF CINEMA IN TURKEY'' -- presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center with the Moon and Stars Project of the American Turkish Society -- all the more valuable. With movies from the late 1950s to the present, the series concentrates on socially engaged works rather than on the country's commercial cinema. Mr. Ceylan's work, represented here by the measured, melancholy ''Climates'' (2006), feels familiar in an art-house way. A movie like Yilmaz Guney's ''Elegy'' (1971) seems more like a window into another world. A story of smugglers, it plays at times like a western, with shootouts on a rocky hillside, where tumbling boulders present as much of a threat as bullets. But it also takes time to show a lovely female doctor teaching villagers about safe water. Through May 10, Walter Reade Theater and Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, Lincoln Center, filmlinc .com."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"FIN de siècle Paris may have been a hotbed of debauchery, but the most compelling painter of that time, ÉDOUARD VUILLARD (1868-1940), stayed home and painted his mother and sisters in their modest rooms pursuing ordinary domestic activities. Compact, flattened and densely patterned, yet mysteriously atmospheric, those works gained early success for the young Vuillard and remain among the most beloved paintings of the Post-Impressionist era. Conventional wisdom has it that Vuillard failed to live up to his early promise. Unlike his coevals Matisse and Bonnard, after 1900 Vuillard took a traditionalist turn to realistic portraiture and decorative wall painting. Viewers may judge for themselves whether his critics have been unkind this week when ''Édouard Vuillard: A Painter and His Muses, 1890-1940'' opens Friday at the Jewish Museum. The first major museum show in New York to focus on Vuillard in 20 years, the exhibition will present more than 50 paintings as well as prints and photographs. It also will examine the influence of friends, supporters, critics and benefactors -- many of whom were Jewish -- on the artist's life and work.

Near the end of the process, each piano is wheeled into the ''pounding room,'' where 88 rubber fingers play the instrument for hours, breaking in the piano and exposing any problems or weaknesses. After being tuned several times, each piano has a final inspection.

His work earned numerous patents and industry accolades until his retirement from Schering Plough Research Institute in 1996. In retirement, Dr. Walker published a book on chemical processes and traveled the world with Paddy, his wife. He was drawn to remote regions, where he indulged his love of photography. Dr. Walker had a passion for writing verse, describing himself as ""not even a minor poet, but a micro poet,"" and published a collection of his writings, ""Curious and Quirky Verse: 1941-2011."" Characteristic of his altruism, he designated the proceeds to Adam's Camp for special-needs children in Colorado. The importance of education was an enduring theme of Dr. Walker's life.

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"THE Dutch company INTRODANS will reintroduce itself this week. When New York audiences caught their first glimpse of this group in 2005, in the form of the Introdans Youth Ensemble, they applauded its vitality. Now, seven years later, the main company is making its American debut. The performers promise to be just as lively as the youth ensemble in ''Heavenly,'' a program of three ballets by three choreographers, all on transcendental themes as expressed by the immediacy of beautiful dancing bodies. Two are by Dutch choreographers: Ed Wubbe's ''Messiah,'' to excerpts from Handel, juxtaposes swirling ensembles with intimate duets, and Nils Christe's ''Fünf Gedichte'' employs Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'' to suggest the transition from life to death. In contrast ''Paradise?'' by the Brazilian choreographer Gisela Rocha combines hip-hop and tap with sexy moves and urban cool set to music by Michael Sauter. Viewers will have to decide for themselves what that question mark in the title may mean. 7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $49."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"ROHATYN--Jeannette S. Died Easter Sunday, April 8, 2012, after a long illness. She is mourned and missed by her sons, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, and by all those whose lives she touched. She was born Jeanne Emma Streit in Paris, France, on December 26, 1924. Her father, Clarence K. Streit of Missoula, Mont., was a poet, New York Times correspondent and anti-fascist polemicist, whose book ""Union Now"", published on the eve of World War II, advanced the idea of federating the world's democracies, anticipating NATO and the European Union by decades. It was an idea to which he devoted the rest of his life. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. Her mother and namesake, Jeanne Defrance, of Lille, France, and later Paris, was herself the niece of a significant figure in French jurisprudence, Fernand Payen, who, as former Chief Barrister of the Paris Bar Association, was assigned the unenviable task of defending Marechal Petain in his trial for treason in the months following the Liberation. Her beloved grandmother Marguerite was an editor at La Vie Heureuse. Jeannette's parents met at a bus stop at the Place de L'Opera in 1920 and remained inseparable for the rest of their lives. Her mother lived to be 101. Jeannette's early years would be defined by her father's intellectual and political journey. The family moved from Paris to Vienna and then Geneva, where Jeannette attended the Ecole Internationale; and then to Missoula, Montana, and Washington, DC, where she attended high school. It was as a teenager in Montana that Jeannette must first have become aware of her difference, and of the uncommon breadth of her worldview. It was a difference and apartness that she celebrated for the rest of her life. She attended Swarthmore College, majoring in art history, and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1946. An active alumnus who served on the Board of Trustees from 1977 to 1980, she went on to established the Clarence K. Streit Scholarship and the Baudelaire Award in French Studies. After college, she went to work at the United Nations in the then novel field of simultaneous interpreting, covering the French/Spanish/English section from 1947 until her retirement in 1963. As a member of the first generation of United Nations staff, she joined a remarkable and in many ways glamorous group, international in character and far-flung as a matter of fact, in a job that provided a front-row seat to events shaping the post-War and Cold War years. In 1956 she married Felix Rohatyn, then a salaried investment banker at Lazard Freres. Soon thereafter, the couple bought a large, sunny apartment on Park Avenue for the price of a luxury German sedan today; he became Partner in the firm, and she left the UN to raise their children. In 1958 they greeted the first of three boys, Pierre, with Nicolas and Michael following soon after. Though the marriage ended in divorce, recent years saw a renewal of friendship, with holidays spent together in the company of their children and grandchildren, and concern for each other discreetly communicated and well understood. After retirement, Jeannette's energies found further outlet in the service of her lifelong passion opera. An indefatigable volunteer with the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, she oversaw the Eastern Region for many years, assisting such voices through the program's ranks as Susan Graham, Renee Fleming, Dawn Upshaw, Hei-Kyung Hong and Samuel Ramey. A Jeannette Rohatyn Prize she called it the ""Great Promise Award"" was established by her sons in 2005 to honor one of her pet concerns: the runner-up. It aptly reflects her nature, of keeping faith with all of her beloved singers, especially those who might need encouragement the most. Jeannette's other passions were wordplay, languages, trees, unstructured time for children, perfectly ripe cherries and, as anyone who knew her can attest, The Right Way of Doing Things. She was exacting, loyal, charming, an astute critic and an overly stern self-critic, and a person for whom being cultivated was neither aspirational nor a privilege, but an innate, human virtue. She is survived by her sons Pierre, of St. Alexandre, France, and Nicolas and Michael of New York City; her nieces Valerie Schroth of Westport, CT, and Lisa Devon Kirkley of Alexandria, VA; and nephews Eric Perret of Milford, CT and Andrew Perret of Brooklyn, NY; and her beloved grandchildren Alexander, Coco, Clara, Nicholas and Ida.

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Feb. 2, Oxford, England I came across the Godstow Nunnery while on a shoot near Oxford at the end of a bitterly cold day of rain and wind. The light was drawing in, but it had an unusually luminous quality to it, and it was the play of that light on the side of the building and in the windows that drew me to making this shot. There were some geese nesting nearby, and a group of males set off through the frame. Others followed at a more leisurely pace, and it was at that point that I took the picture. Just to my left, out of the frame, runs the River Thames, and while I was there, I got to chatting with a guy living on a houseboat that he had moored next to the nunnery. He told me that the large, semi-mobile houseboat community that lives in and around Oxford were subject to new restrictions and mooring charges in an effort to move them from the view of tourists and the upwardly mobile and vowed there would be a fight back. The mixture of the elements of light, the ancient setting and the talk of resistance made it, in my mind, a quintessentially English scene. ANDREW TESTA, freelance photographer, London"

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"D'URSO--Florence B. Florence B. D'Urso was welcomed peacefully into the arms of our Lord on Tuesday, April 24, 2012 at Calvary Hospital. A longtime resident of Pelham Manor, NY and Manhattan, she is survived by her loving daughters, Donna and Lisa, her devoted son Mark and beloved granddaughter Michaela Frances D'Urso, daughter-in-law Michelle, sister and brother-in-law Rose Ann and Donald White, sister-in-law Mary Pelletiere and many loving friends, cousins, nieces and nephews. She was sadly predeceased by her beloved husband Camillo, her beloved son David Francis, her parents, Anna and Anthony Perkosky, her brother, the late Rev. Francis Perkosky S.S. and brother and sister-in-law Anthony and Lucia Perkosky. Florence will be remembered for her steadfast faith, her extraordinary grace in the face of deep grief and pain, her beauty, compassion, her appreciation of architecture, art and design, and her love of flowers as symbols of God's munificence. She was a graduate of Marywood University and New York School of Interior Design. She worked professionally as a teacher, a fashion model, as a VP of Design and Planning and after the untimely death of her husband, as Chairman of the Board and CEO of D'Urso Supermarkets, Inc. Throughout her life, Florence was committed to charitable involvement with organizations and also undertook many projects on her own. With her husband Camillo, she built Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Cancun, a Technology Center at Iona Prep and the Patient Activity Center at Calvary Hospital. Florence became a major donor to St. Vincent's and Our Lady of Mercy Hospitals as well as establishing Birthing Clinics overseas. Compassion for the poor led Florence to found seven different Funds the world over, defining her as an international philanthropist. Her devout faith impelled Florence to direct much of her beneficence to the Catholic Church and the priesthood. She founded scholarships at St. Joseph's Seminary and the Pontifical North American College as well as providing ongoing support to the Legionaries of Christ, the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Life. Because of her closeness to Blessed Mother Teresa, Florence developed a special relationship with her followers, the Missionaries of Charity. For almost two decades, Florence contributed in a major way to the restoration work at St. Patrick's Cathedral. She also did the floral arrangements for its altars, becoming known as the Cathedral's ""Flower Lady."" On a really grand scale, Florence designed, and worked hands-on with the floral arrangements for the visits of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI; the latter despite her painful battle with cancer. Florence was only the third person, thus far, to receive the Michelangelo Medal for her outstanding support of the Art of the Vatican Museums. She also funded restoration work here as a member of the New York Municipal Art Society and Old Westbury Gardens. The Inner-City Scholarship Fund was a significant beneficiary of her generosity, and Florence gave as a major donor to Boys' Town of Italy, Best Buddies International, Special Olympics and Marywood University in her desire to support youth, intellectual and developmental disabilities and education. Her countless projects and tireless work for the less fortunate led Florence to be recognized by organizations both large and small, in the U.S. and throughout the world. She was the first woman appointed to serve as Trustee of St. Patrick's Cathedral, she also served as a Trustee of Inner-City Scholarship Fund, as Calvary Fund Board Trustee Emerita and as a past Trustee of Best Buddies International. She served on the Iona Grammar and Preparatory School Mother Auxiliary Boards, St. Vincent's Hospital, Harrison-Auxiliary and Advisory Board, Boys' Town of Italy and Our Lady of Mercy Hospital. She was honored as a Dame of Magistral Grace of the Sovereign Military Hospitalier Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, as Dame Commander with Star of St. Gregory the Great and Dame Grand Cross of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. When praised for her selfless efforts and generosity, Florence would often quote her sainted idol, Blessed Mother Teresa, saying, ""God does not choose us to do good, we must choose to do good."" Florence made that choice for the betterment of countless lives. She hoped to, and tried to guide souls as well through recognition of and devotion to Divine Mercy. Her oft repeated prayer was ""Jesus, I trust in you."" Family will receive friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home (1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street) on Tuesday, May 1st from 7-9pm, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-4pm and 7-9pm.

Born December 18, 1930 in New York City, the daughter of William Ziegler, Jr. and Helen Murphy Ziegler, she grew up in New York City and Darien, CT. She graduated from the Nightingale-Bamford School and attended Colum- bia University before working as a research assistant at the Sloane-Kettering Institute under Dr. Ernst Wynder. Throughout her life, Mrs. Steinkraus displayed extraordinary courage, individuality, generosity and taste, and was a staunchly loyal friend. An elegant person, she was also an accomplished, versatile and widely experienced sportswoman. She raced sailboats in Long Island Sound with her brother, William Ziegler III, skied all over the United States and in Europe, fox hunted with many American packs and several Irish ones, hunted wildfowl and upland birds in the U.S. and Mexico and made two African hunting safaris. After she married Olympic show-jumper William Steinkraus in 1960 she became interested in equestrian dressage and embarked on a successful competitive career that took her all the way to the Grand Prix Level. Eventually she became a sought-after senior national and international judge and an important dressage organizer. In retrospect, she played a valuable role in the development of dressage in America. Aside from her participation in sport, Mrs. Steinkraus took special interest in Darien's Post 53 Ambulance service where she qualified as an EMT-I. She was also formerly a director of the American Maize-Products Co. headed by her brother and a lifelong director of the E. Matilda Ziegler Foundation for the Blind.

From childhood, Robert had a keen interest in business and started many enterprises, most famously, in his preteen years, a rabbit farm. Robert graduated from the Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, where he was the 2008 distinguished alumnus and a member of its sports hall of fame, and in 1979 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Following graduation, he worked for Sonoco, a paper products company in Hartsville SC, before going to Wake Forest School of Business and receiving an MBA with honors in 1983. Later that year, he joined Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in Manhattan as a stockbroker. In 1998 he joined Tiger Management, a New York City fund. In 2000 he co-founded his own hedge fund, Williamson McAree Investments, and, in January of 2011, joined Chilton Investment Co. where at his death he was a managing director. As a New Yorker, Robert maintained his ties to the South, hosting a Christmas party with Caroline where Southern accents predominated, and attending the annual ball of the North Carolina Society of New York, where he served a term as president. Robert played junior varsity basketball for Carolina, and he remained an avid Tar Heel fan. He gave time and money to many New York charities, including New Life of New York City, a faith-based youth outreach organization, where he was chairman of the board at his death, and Inwood House, where Caroline plays a leadership role. He was a longtime member of the Church of the Heavenly Rest, and at the time of his death was chairing the search for a new pastor. In addition to the family members mentioned above, Robert is survived by his sister Blanche Spencer Williamson of Southampton, NY; brother Julian Robertson Williamson of Raleigh, wife Elizabeth and their three daughters; stepfather Zack Bacon; stepbrothers, Zack Bacon, Louis Bacon, and Bart Bacon; stepmother, Eve Williamson; stepbrothers Bill Blades and Rob Blades and stepsister Helen Dixon; mother- and father-in-law Betty and C.B. Crook of Albemarle NC; brother-in-law Charles Crook of Marina del Rey, CA; uncle, Julian Robertson of New York City; aunt, Wyndham Robertson of Chapel Hill, and many beloved first cousins with whom he was in regular contact. A visitation will be held on Sunday, April 29th, from 3:00-5:00pm at The House of the Redeemer at 7 East 95th Street. A funeral will be held on Monday, April 30th, at 4:00pm at the Church of the Heavenly Rest at 90th Street and Fifth Avenue. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, a contribution be made to New Life of New York City, 66 Clinton Street, NYC, 10002; to the Church of the Heavenly Rest, 2 E. 90th Street, NYC, 10128; or to the charity of one's choice."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"SCHAPIRO--Ruth, 92, formerly of Merrick, NY, died April 27, 2012. A 1942 graduate of the Maryland College for Women and wife of the late Harry Schapiro. She met her husband on a blind date in 1947 and they married in 1948. They were together for 54 years. Having grown up in the Hotel St. George in Brooklyn Heights, she was like the original Eloise and had many fond memories of her life in what once was the largest hotel in New York. She often reminisced about meeting the many vaudeville performers that stayed there, christening what was then the world's largest indoor salt water pool with Johnny Weissmuller, trips to Coney Island, riding the subways for a nickel and spending her summers at Queen Lake Camp in Athol, Mass. She will be remembered for her humor, warmth, love of chocolate and addiction to crossword puzzles. Ruth is survived by a large flock: her children Marilyn and Lester Epstein, Gail and Jim Salk, Judy and Jerry Dietz and Dick and Linda Schapiro; grandchildren Marc and Amy Epstein, Eric and Mara Epstein, Rebecca Salk and Michael Hammond Berne, Ben Salk and Cynthia Lin, Robert Dietz, Marty Schapiro, Steve Schapiro and Lizzy Schapiro; and great grandchildren Seth, Zach, Hannah and Matthew Epstein. The family acknowledges with great appreciation the extraordinary care and love provided by Ruth's Bridges Cornell Heights family for the past eight years as well as the compassionate medical assistance of Dr. Tim Cardina. She left this world a happy camper and will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her. Contributions in her memory can be made to Hospicare & Palliative Care Services of Tompkins County 172 E. King Road, Ithaca, NY 14850 or Friendship Donations Network, PO Box 4854, Ithaca, NY 14852."

2012-04-29T00:00:00Z,"THIS dreamy 1993 canvas is sure to be a winner when it comes up for sale on May 8. Prices for the 80-year-old Mr. Richter have been steadily rising, helped in large part by a highly praised retrospective at the Tate Modern in London this winter, which is now at the National Gallery in Berlin and will be heading to the Pompidou Center in Paris in June. Last year alone some $200 million worth of works by Mr. Richter sold at auction. ''It's eye candy for the emerging buyer,'' Mr. Gorvy said. The size of the canvas -- it is nearly eight feet square -- make it particularly impressive as does the masterly layering of colors, which is at once romantic and modern. It is being sold by Lyn Ross, the widow of George Ross, a financier from Bryn Mawr, Pa., who died in July."

2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"5:45 P.M. (TMC) AGORA (2010) In this historical saga from Alejandro Amenábar (''The Others''), Rachel Weisz portrays Hypatia, a pagan noblewoman who directs the library in ancient Alexandria and, while pursuing the mysteries of the cosmos, incites the passions of three men: her slave Davus (Max Minghella); a shy pupil, Synesius (Rupert Evans); and a much less shy one, Orestes (Oscar Isaac, above with Ms. Weisz). But Hypatia is indifferent not only to their desire but also to the religious tension among Christians and Jews that is threatening the peace of her city. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that the film, which he chose as a critics' pick, ''is entirely -- not dogmatically but stubbornly -- on the side of reason, science and liberalism, values opposed by superstition, fundamentalism and political expediency.'' He added: ''The warning bell that 'Agora' sounds may be loud and at times a little grating, but what's wrong with that? The skeptical and the secular also need stories of martyrdom and rousing acts of cinematic preaching.'' 7:30 A.M. (HBO) MELINDA AND MELINDA (2005) Two playwrights -- one of dramas (Larry Pine), the other of comedies (Wallace Shawn) -- speculate on an anecdote about an unhappy young woman named Melinda (Radha Mitchell), who, after crashing a dinner party with an air of distress and a tale of woe, stirs up instabilities within her friends' lives. Will Ferrell and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the men vying for Melinda's affections in these two separate visions in this Woody Allen movie. Mr. Allen can best be appreciated ''as an unrivaled pornographer,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''The kind of New Yorkers likely to see a Woody Allen movie reserve their true lust for real estate, and the long hallways, high ceilings and open kitchens on display in this movie are likely to keep local audiences sighing and moaning for the full 99 minutes.''"

It was unclear whether other investors would join the city pension funds and vote against Wal-Mart's directors. Board members at some large public companies have come under fire from shareholders at annual meetings this year, but most of the opposition has been related to executive pay practices.

For 44 years, since its last league title, Manchester City has dreamed of overthrowing Manchester United as the dominant force in its area code, let alone English soccer. Four decades of servitude could soon be over, as City recorded a momentous 1-0 victory over its old foe on Monday night, taking it to the top of the standings. In case the millions of viewers missed its significance, Patrice Evra, the Manchester United captain, explained the consequences should City take the title.

After that it's a one-two punch of brutality: a quick-paced ''Blown Away,'' in which a young woman hides in her basement, waiting out a tornado that she hopes her abusive, alcoholic father sleeping upstairs doesn't survive; followed by ''Two Black Cadillacs,'' in which a wife and a mistress conspire to kill the man they share, not a murder ballad so much as a murder celebration."

Macon, a former assistant under Broadus, had two seasons remaining on his contract, and the university will pay him $300,000 to leave.

2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"D'URSO--Florence B. Florence B. D'Urso was welcomed peacefully into the arms of our Lord on Tuesday, April 24, 2012 at Calvary Hospital. A longtime resident of Pelham Manor, NY and Manhattan, she is survived by her loving daughters, Donna and Lisa, her devoted son Mark and beloved granddaughter Michaela Frances D'Urso, daughter-in-law Michelle, sister and brother-in-law Rose Ann and Donald White, sister-in-law Mary Pelletiere and many loving friends, cousins, nieces and nephews. She was sadly predeceased by her beloved husband Camillo, her beloved son David Francis, her parents, Anna and Anthony Perkosky, her brother, the late Rev. Francis Perkosky S.S. and brother and sister-in-law Anthony and Lucia Perkosky. Florence will be remembered for her steadfast faith, her extraordinary grace in the face of deep grief and pain, her beauty, compassion, her appreciation of architecture, art and design, and her love of flowers as symbols of God's munificence. She was a graduate of Marywood University and New York School of Interior Design. She worked professionally as a teacher, a fashion model, as a VP of Design and Planning and after the untimely death of her husband, as Chairman of the Board and CEO of D'Urso Supermarkets, Inc. Throughout her life, Florence was committed to charitable involvement with organizations and also undertook many projects on her own. With her husband Camillo, she built Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Cancun, a Technology Center at Iona Prep and the Patient Activity Center at Calvary Hospital. Florence became a major donor to St. Vincent's and Our Lady of Mercy Hospitals as well as establishing Birthing Clinics overseas. Compassion for the poor led Florence to found seven different Funds the world over, defining her as an international philanthropist. Her devout faith impelled Florence to direct much of her beneficence to the Catholic Church and the priesthood. She founded scholarships at St. Joseph's Seminary and the Pontifical North American College as well as providing ongoing support to the Legionaries of Christ, the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Life. Because of her closeness to Blessed Mother Teresa, Florence developed a special relationship with her followers, the Missionaries of Charity. For almost two decades, Florence contributed in a major way to the restoration work at St. Patrick's Cathedral. She also did the floral arrangements for its altars, becoming known as the Cathedral's ""Flower Lady."" On a really grand scale, Florence designed, and worked hands-on with the floral arrangements for the visits of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI; the latter despite her painful battle with cancer. Florence was only the third person, thus far, to receive the Michelangelo Medal for her outstanding support of the Art of the Vatican Museums. She also funded restoration work here as a member of the New York Municipal Art Society and Old Westbury Gardens. The Inner-City Scholarship Fund was a significant beneficiary of her generosity, and Florence gave as a major donor to Boys' Town of Italy, Best Buddies International, Special Olympics and Marywood University in her desire to support youth, intellectual and developmental disabilities and education. Her countless projects and tireless work for the less fortunate led Florence to be recognized by organizations both large and small, in the U.S. and throughout the world. She was the first woman appointed to serve as Trustee of St. Patrick's Cathedral, she also served as a Trustee of Inner-City Scholarship Fund, as Calvary Fund Board Trustee Emerita and as a past Trustee of Best Buddies International. She served on the Iona Grammar and Preparatory School Mother Auxiliary Boards, St. Vincent's Hospital, Harrison-Auxiliary and Advisory Board, Boys' Town of Italy and Our Lady of Mercy Hospital. She was honored as a Dame of Magistral Grace of the Sovereign Military Hospitalier Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, as Dame Commander with Star of St. Gregory the Great and Dame Grand Cross of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. When praised for her selfless efforts and generosity, Florence would often quote her sainted idol, Blessed Mother Teresa, saying, ""God does not choose us to do good, we must choose to do good."" Florence made that choice for the betterment of countless lives. She hoped to, and tried to guide souls as well through recognition of and devotion to Divine Mercy. Her oft repeated prayer was ""Jesus, I trust in you."" Family will receive friends at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home (1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street) on Tuesday, May 1st from 7-9pm, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-4pm and 7-9pm.

The sections about Owens's pre-Olympic career will introduce you to his epochal day at the Big Ten track and field championships in 1935, when he set or tied four world records in less than an hour, an achievement that dwarfs, in purely athletic terms, what he achieved at the Berlin Olympics the next year."

Such assaults, along with what activists described as a major security sweep through the restive Damascus suburb of Douma, underscored that a United Nations cease-fire imposed less than three weeks ago existed more in name than in fact."

Other accounts in the Indian media put the death toll at more than 100. The accident occurred in the remote Indian state of Assam. The state police chief, J. N. Choudhury, told The Associated Press that about 150 people managed to swim to safety or were rescued. Ferry accidents happen with a grim frequency in eastern India and Bangladesh, where many people depend on boats to travel through the region."

Ms. Cosmadopoulos works not in real estate, but in the field of art therapy and instruction, and she has plenty of student loans to pay. So to make ends meet in this city, she has worked odd jobs, eaten many $1 tacos and chased low rents around Brooklyn, keeping that expense consistently hovering around $625 per month, give or take a few tacos."

2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"At one point toward the end of last week, as each of them mustered stoic faces for sorry fates, John Edwards and Newt Gingrich were only a few dozen miles apart. Edwards sat mutely in a courtroom in Greensboro, N.C., where his breathtaking deceptions in the service of his towering ambitions were laid bare for the world, which watched raptly, but not in admiration. Gingrich shuffled pointlessly through a zoo in Asheboro, N.C., a peacock with faded plumage, still preening and still campaigning, though the attentions of most reporters and the affections of most voters had moved on. After the zoo, he visited the nearby Petty Museum. The Richard Petty museum, that is, but you can't blame a columnist for abbreviating its name, given how neatly the shorthand complements the candidate."

By the time we reach this sentence, toward the end, Epstein has taken us -- practically moment by moment -- through the series of events that culminated with D.S.K.'s arrest for allegedly forcing himself sexually on a hotel maid in Manhattan. The charges were later dropped when prosecutors concluded that, even though the assault likely took place, the maid's credibility was a problem. Still, Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. And his political career -- he was the favorite to challenge President Nicolas Sarkozy of France in the election that will be decided on Sunday -- was destroyed."

There's something puckish about Mr. Lohar's stage presence, even when he's belting 17th-century mystic poetry that proclaims, ''Every time I think of you, the Divine, I feel breathless'' -- a phrase among the lyrics of a Sufi song performed by Mr. Lohar that has had more than eight million views on YouTube, ''Alif Allah Chambey di Booti'' (''My Spiritual Guide Has Planted the Jasmine-Scented Essence of Love for Allah in My Heart'')."

Yet the much earlier Permian extinction -- 252 million years ago -- was by far the most catastrophic of the planet's five known paroxysms of species loss. No wonder it is called the Great Dying: Scientists calculate that about 95 percent of marine species, and an uncountable but probably comparable percentage of land species, went extinct in a geological heartbeat."
2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Mitt Romney said on Monday that ''even Jimmy Carter'' would have issued the order to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan a year ago, dismissing President Obama's suggestion that Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, would not have followed the same path as the president. The swipe at the White House, delivered casually on the rope line of a campaign event here, touched off a pointed exchange with Mr. Obama, who quickly accused Mr. Romney of flip-flopping on an issue that the president has put at the center of his re-election campaign."

As part of their courting strategy, they decorate these bowers with fruits, and the seeds of these fruits germinate. This results in new plants of the species Solanum ellipticum, also known as the potato bush."

2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"The New York agency that oversees horse racing in the state on Monday limited the size of the purses offered in races involving cheaper horses. It acknowledged that fattened purses, many of them being offered at racetracks where casinos had been opened in recent years, had created a dangerous incentive to push sore or unfit horses onto the track. The agency, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board, said racetracks could not offer purses greater than twice the assigned value of the horses running in any claiming races, the less glamorous races that make up the backbone of the daily programs at many tracks."

They argue with withering humor over who will buy cigarettes. But Mr. Voorintholt and Mr. Wiggers aren't a couple (well, at least not right now, but more on that later). In 1971 Mr. Wiggers, now 65, founded Introdans, a ballet company in the small city of Arnhem in the eastern Netherlands; Mr. Voorintholt, now 50, joined as a dancer in 1982.

''They say in the Middle East a pessimist is simply an optimist with experience,'' Mr. Barak said in a speech to about 100 members of the Foreign Press Association at the King David Hotel. Acknowledging that a military strike was ''not simple'' and would be ''complicated by certain risks,'' he said that a ''radical Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear weapons would be far more dangerous both for the region and, indeed, the whole world.''"

2012-04-30T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- The most versatile of the classic Anglo-Saxon swear words has, diligent research reveals, made just one appearance in oral arguments before the Supreme Court. The cursing, in 1971, probably won the case, which concerned the prosecution of a vulgar protest against the draft during the Vietnam War. By repeating the word in court, the protester's lawyer showed that it could have a role in public discourse. Over the next two decades or so, the word was used in nine Supreme Court decisions, typically in quotations of something a criminal had said. Its last appearance was in 1993. Popular culture has grown coarser over the years, and the word is commonplace in hit songs and ubiquitous on cable television. The Supreme Court has moved in the opposite direction."

This light-ish, lime-ish green, as it turned out, was about the only color left for official city vehicles. Red is best for firetrucks; blue is mostly reserved for the police. Orange wouldn't work because, as Mr. Yassky explained, it is hard to get an orange that doesn't look like yellow in some light. Black is mostly for limos and hearses. Forget white or gray; those are the favorite colors for private vehicles (which could cause confusion). So green it is."

It said the rule unjustly penalized an athlete twice for the same offense. The decision paves the way for athletes like the sprinter Dwain Chambers and the cyclist David Millar to seek spots on the British Olympic team for the London Games in the summer. In 2003, Chambers tested positive for THG, an undetectable steroid, and served a two-year ban. Millar admitted using EPO and was barred in 2004 for two years."

The requirement, which has been approved by the state's four appellate divisions, will ensure that all lawyers starting out have some degree of real-world experience. It is also a practical way to foster a stronger culture of public service in the legal profession, while providing more assistance for the many hundreds of thousands of people without lawyers in the state's civil court system. Like many states, New York allows law students to perform legal work under the supervision of faculty members or legal services groups."

It also seems to be the philosophy at Blue Smoke, the barbecue restaurants owned by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group, which have taken 10 years to come up with a new sauce to slather on their pork. Unlike the company's all-purpose Original Recipe BBQ Sauce, with its fairly mild ketchup and mustard base, the tangy newcomer, Blue Smoke Carolina Kick Barbecue Sauce, can run roughshod over a pile of pulled pork, giving it a robust new personality. ''We try to represent all the barbecue regions in the country -- Kansas City, Texas, Memphis -- and we wanted the Carolinas, too,'' said Kenny Callaghan, the chef and pit-master. The sauce is a typical vinegar-based North Carolina blend, well dappled with bits of spice, which the restaurants now serve on the pulled pork. ''The pork is somewhat fatty, so it can take the spice and vinegar,'' Mr. Callaghan said. ''But if someone prefers the other sauce, they can still get it on the pork.'' And if someone buys the new sauce to take home, it can do wonders for a slab of fish, a flank steak or lamb chops on the grill."

The book was Hilary Mantel's ''Wolf Hall,'' and it would have dwarfed the competition any year. ''Wolf Hall'' was a historical novel that ingeniously revisited well-trod territory (the early marriages of Henry VIII), turned the phlegmatic villain Thomas Cromwell into the best-drawn figure and easily mixed 16th-century ambience with timeless bitchery. Despite a hugely complicated cast of characters and Ms. Mantel's teasing way of preferring pronouns to proper names, it wound up providing an experience of sheer bliss. It was a hard act to follow.

Mr. Obama's address, during an unannounced visit to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that sets the terms for relations after the departure of American troops in 2014, was a chance for him to make an election-year case that he is winding down a costly and increasingly unpopular war."

In a new authorized biography of the journalism legend Ben Bradlee, ''Yours in Truth,'' by Jeff Himmelman, Mr. Bradlee is quoted expressing some anxiety over some of the most provocative and enduring details of ''All the President's Men,'' the famous unfurling of the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"In April, the government of Premier Jean Charest introduced a bill in the Quebec National Assembly that seeks to protect nearly 150 million acres -- half of northern Quebec, an area the size of France -- from industrial development, including logging, mining and petroleum exploration. The bill matters, not just to Canada but to the world: The boreal forests and tundra of northern Canada remain a relatively intact ecosystem, absorbing more carbon than the world's tropical forests and providing a vital buffer against global warming. Industrial development would weaken that buffer, and, as things stand now, there is almost nothing to prevent it. As envisioned by Mr. Charest, the bill would have made a firm commitment to prevent all industrial activity. As revised by government bureaucrats, the latest version promises only that, at some future point, steps will be taken to ''protect the environment, maintain biodiversity, enhance the natural heritage and promote the sustainable use of resources.'' Mr. Charest is the leader of a majority government, so the bill will almost certainly pass. Before it does, it needs to be strengthened to prohibit even piecemeal development in this sensitive region."

While biologists have long attached simple color bands to birds' legs, the amount of data they get back has been limited -- and often they do not get information until the bird has died. But in the past few years, Global Positioning System tags have gained in popularity, allowing wildlife managers and the public to track a bird's daily movements and long-distance migrations.

But her candid admission reflected the cold calculation that continues to shape President Obama's foreign policy when it comes to championing rights and freedoms abroad.

The accident occurred on Monday afternoon, on the Brahmaputra River, as the double-decker ferry was approaching shore near Buraburi, in the state of Assam.

He had just scored the decisive goal in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal Tuesday night against the Flyers, and at the other end of the ice Devils goalie Martin Brodeur figured Clarkson was milking the moment, posing for photographs. Zach Parise knew otherwise. He skated a few strides and told his pal, ''Get off the net so we can celebrate.'' The Devils' 4-1 victory offered cause for rejoicing in their locker room and for consternation inside the Flyers', where players lamented a lack of competitiveness and resolve. Over the final 40 minutes, the Devils outplayed, outskated and outhustled the Flyers, an effort rewarded by a four-goal outburst in the third period that evened their series heading into Game 3 on Thursday in Newark."

Nine Planned Parenthood clinics sued the state, saying that the rule, requiring all those in the program to certify that they do not affiliate with entities that perform or promote abortions, was unconstitutional. The rule would have removed 49 Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas from the state's so-called Medicaid Women's Health Program beginning Tuesday. Judge Lee Yeakel ruled that by requiring the certification the state ''is reaching beyond the scope of the government program and penalizing plaintiffs for their protected conduct.'' The state attorney general, Greg Abbott, immediately appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to lift the injunction. A spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission said it would comply with the ruling."

Classical ballet dancers discuss motion-capture techniques with nerdling video-game designers. Wealthy collectors and powerful curators flirt with ambitious young things just out of the local Kunstakademie. Artistic collaborations are hatched; careers are born; beer is drunk. The Freitagsküche, or Friday Kitchen, is the gustatory gestalt of the contemporary German art scene, which by some lights is producing the most interesting art in the world today. There's no guest list, no velvet rope at the door. Anybody who can find the place, which is hidden at the far end of an alley across the street from the city's former Hells Angels headquarters, is invited to share in the feast. ''When I found the building,'' said Michael Riedel, the artist-impresario behind the weekly dinner, ''it was full of junkies.''

The Obama ad will run in three battleground states -- Ohio, Virginia and Iowa -- where the anti-Obama ad has also appeared. THE SCRIPT The ad begins with a man's emphatic voice reading quotes that appear on screen -- ''over the top,'' ''erroneous,'' ''out of context'' -- to describe the anti-Obama ad. The narrator counters, ''President Obama's clean energy initiatives have helped create jobs for projects across America, not overseas.'' The narrator quickly asks, ''What about Mitt Romney?'' and answers, ''As a corporate C.E.O., he shipped American jobs to places like Mexico and China. As governor, he outsourced state jobs to a call center in India. He's still pushing tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.'' The ad ends with the line about the Swiss bank account."

A Saint-Émilion is also on the list. An ounce may not sound like much, but it's rare to find these wines by the glass anywhere, and even a few sips provide a very special sample. ''It lets people taste wines they might never have had a chance to try,'' Mr. Compeyre said. ''Some will order seconds or thirds.'' He took over as wine director at Benoit last summer and installed a state-of-the-art dispensing system that made it possible to serve fine wines by the glass while preserving the rest of the bottle. He offers the wines until the supply is finished, then finds others, revising the list every week or two.

The decision by the appellate judge was the latest twist in a dispute between Texas officials and Planned Parenthood that threatens a health program that serves more than 100,000 women. At issue is a state rule requiring all providers in the Medicaid Women's Health Program to certify that they do not affiliate with entities that perform or promote abortions. Nine Planned Parenthood clinics that do not perform abortions sued the state. On Monday, Judge Lee Yeakel of Federal District Court blocked the state from enforcing the rule, but the state attorney general appealed, and Judge Jerry E. Smith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay of the order. As a result, state health officials said on Tuesday that they had begun banning all abortion providers and affiliates from the program. Planned Parenthood said it continued to treat the program's patients on Tuesday while preparing to respond to Judge Smith's stay."

In the background, however, lurk a host of concerns about how things could go once the bulk of American troops leave and the pipeline of foreign aid slows to a trickle, which is expected to happen by the end of 2014. Both will increase the country's already deep sense of precariousness.

2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"For years, drug companies have known that their days of plenty were numbered, that the moment would arrive when the best-selling drugs that had driven two decades' worth of profits would lose their patent protection and succumb to competition from generic alternatives. Without new blockbusters to replace them, profits would tumble. For Pfizer, that day has arrived. Pfizer profited from hits like Lipitor and Viagra, and swallowed up smaller companies from the 1990s onward."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- As any pilot will tell you, landing an aircraft in a crosswind is a challenge. So, too, is deciding on where -- or whether -- to build a new airport runway. The political winds in Britain have shifted countless times over the decades on the question of expanding aviation capacity in and around London, which is already served by six commercial airports. No fewer than 10 government studies on the subject have been commissioned since 1946."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"When Anne Griswold Tyng entered Radcliffe College in 1938, she had already found her calling: her faith was in architecture. ''I was intensely drawn to the combination of science and art, of the pragmatic and aesthetic, of rigorous facts and intuitive leaps,'' she wrote, looking back nearly 60 years later. The child of Episcopal missionaries with deep roots in colonial Massachusetts, Tyng was born in China and educated in Jiangxi Province and New York State. One winter while she was a student at the Kuling American School, she packed snow into wooden boxes to make ice blocks and built a high-domed igloo; the following spring, she constructed a circular bamboo hut as a secret hideout. In 1942, she enrolled in the first class to admit women at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer and readily embraced what she described as the ''missionary zeal'' of the Bauhaus-influenced faculty. Tyng, who died last year at the age of 91, had a long career as a pioneering architect and design theorist. She investigated some of the most esoteric corners of her field, delving into universal geometries and mathematical sequences like nature's dynamic symmetries, the irrefutable strength of the Platonic solids and Carl Jung's cyclical interpretation of human existence. The designs generated from these studies are simultaneously radical and traditional, unforeseen structures informed by ancient principles and the natural world. In the 1950s, she was most closely associated with Louis I. Kahn: while employed in his Philadelphia office, she collaborated on the Yale University Art Gallery (1953) and the Trenton Bath House (1955). Appearing in the 2003 documentary ''My Architect,'' Tyng talked about her affair with Kahn; their daughter, Alexandra, was born in Rome in 1954. Working independently, Tyng developed her ideas about space-frame architecture, modeling interlocking geometric patterns to create light-filled, inhabitable spaces."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"WYLIE DUFRESNE slid into a booth the other day at WD-50, his trailblazing restaurant on the Lower East Side, and started talking about science. Specifically, about something called a Faraday cage. A Faraday cage, the chef explained, is a chamber engineered so that its interior is impervious to a surge of electricity. As conceived in the 19th century by a boundlessly curious Englishman named Michael Faraday, the cage could be a safe haven while trees, say, were being spit-roasted a few yards away."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"VAN SLYCK--Peter, of Lyme, CT, on March 17, 2012. Devoted and adored father. Beloved husband of Rosemary (deceased). Alumnus of Brooks School and Yale. Proud recipient of The Distinguished Flying Cross and The Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for World War II service as a ball-turret gunner. Peter flew 29 missions over Europe, including the first daylight mission over Berlin. After college, he worked in banking, theatre, and real estate. A talented athlete who played tennis, squash and golf well into his 80s. He is survived by his children, Kate Van Slyck of Arlington, VA; Ashley Schofield of Princeton, NJ; and Nicholas Van Slyck of San Jose, Costa Rica; seven grandchildren; and his sister Edith Van Slyck of New York, NY. The Memorial Service will be held at the Old Lyme Congregational Church in Old Lyme, CT on May 27th at 3:00pm."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"Higher levels of daily physical activity are associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, new research suggests. The report, in the April 24 issue of Neurology, included 716 people, average age 82, without cognitive impairment. Each wore a wrist actigraph, a device that measures movement, for about 10 days to establish his or her usual level of daily physical activity. Over the next four years, 71 of them developed Alzheimer's."

Capt. Angelo Nieves of the Orange County Sheriff's Office said charges against members of the school band would be announced at a news conference in Orlando."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"THERE was a time here in the Northeast when surf-casting fishermen flung skate on the beach to die. Stupid, yes, and even tragic, but it was considered a ''bait stealer,'' and got in the way of catching the more challenging and beloved striper. Then we discovered that skate was good to eat -- at least as good as striper -- and within a span of just a few years, skate became scarce. Not only is it no longer littering Atlantic beaches, but it is also no longer stealing bait. In fact, it is no longer around much, and stores like Whole Foods are pledging not to carry the fish until the stocks recover."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"WASHINGTON -- Despite Senate approval of a bill to help the debt-ridden Postal Service, thousands of post offices across the country still face closings beginning in two weeks if the House has not completed work on its version of the legislation. The Senate passed a bill to overhaul the Postal Service last week. But legislation has yet to come up for a vote in the House, and lawmakers there do not appear to be in a hurry to proceed despite a May 15 deadline set by the Postal Service before it begins closing post offices."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"Early-20th-century listeners who had just heard Strauss's luxuriant ''Salome'' and Mahler's decadent ''Symphony of a Thousand,'' which had its premiere in 1910, must have been startled by the brevity and atonal language of Webern's Five Movements for String Quartet (Op. 5), which had its Vienna premiere that same year. But when sandwiched between excerpts from George Crumb's ''Black Angels,'' as the short Webern movements were during a program by the Australian Chamber Orchestra at Zankel Hall on Monday evening, they sounded almost romantic."
2012-05-01T00:00:00Z,"COMPARED with its heavy-breathing, hot-blooded brethren, Fendi, Missoni, Versace et al., Ferragamo has always seemed like one of Italy's quieter sons of fashion. There have been no sequined ''it'' purses with silly names; no splashy collaborations with big-box retailers. I tended to think of it as a place where the freakishly delicate of feet get shod -- widths, or narrownesses, go down to AAAA -- and as a reliable purveyor of men's belts and ties for formal occasions."

Congress decided 25 years ago that the Department of Energy should build a repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, a volcanic ridge in Nevada 100 miles from Las Vegas, if the regulatory commission determined the site to be suitable. But the commission decided last year to end its consideration, with the chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, pointing out that Congress was no longer providing money to advance the project."

It made a muffled pop-pop-pop sound, not unlike a rattlesnake, as Selina's fat cells broke.

2012-05-02T00:00:00Z,"''There is a river in the ocean'' are the first words in Matthew Fontaine Maury's pioneering work, ''The Physical Geography of the Sea,'' first published in 1855. Sailors have always been aware of ocean rivers -- currents, that is -- but Maury was the first to produce a scientific chart of the major currents. It was based on thousands of observations recorded by seamen and was, in a sense, an expanded version of the Gulf Stream chart printed in 1769 by Benjamin Franklin after consulting a Nantucket skipper. Both Maury and Franklin would rejoice in a new view of the oceans' currents produced by the Scientific Visualization Studio at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Instead of consulting captains and their logs, the makers of this moving map of the currents around the world from June 2005 through December 2007 used data obtained from satellites and sensors in the ocean. All of that data was then synthesized with a mathematical model developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory."

2012-05-02T00:00:00Z,"When the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark Miranda case that criminal suspects in custody must be told of their right to have a lawyer and to remain silent, the purpose was to ensure that the police and prosecutors did not obtain a confession through improper means. But the office of the Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, has concocted a way around this basic principle with a ''central booking interview program'' in which prosecutors interrogate suspects before they are arraigned or have counsel assigned to them. Fortunately, a state trial judge has found the program misleading, deceptive and unethical, and will not allow the district attorney's office to use statements from this type of interview at trial. Elisaul Perez was arrested for stealing an iPod in March 2009. Before he was arraigned, he was interviewed by a detective and two assistant district attorneys through a Spanish-speaking interpreter. They told Mr. Perez, ''If there is something you would like us to investigate concerning this incident, you must tell us now so we can look into it.''

On record, at least, Mr. Goerne has been much concerned with the songs of Schubert, spinning out a half-dozen eloquent discs on the Harmonia Mundi label over the last four years. But at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, he and Mr. Andsnes presented a program they have been touring together: songs from Mahler's cycles ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn,'' ''Rückert-Lieder'' and ''Kindertotenlieder,'' interspersed with selections from Shostakovich's ''Michelangelo Suite.''"

Union officials said that the strike was endorsed by 95 percent of the 12,500 members who voted last month. The rolling strike, which would not take place until the fall, would be the largest faculty strike in the state's history and would take place over two days at each campus, ultimately affecting more than 400,000 students. The state has cut roughly $970 million from the California State University system since 2008, and university officials have responded by lowering the number of students admitted and raising tuition 23 percent. The union has asked for a 1 percent raise and says that administrators have asked to freeze faculty salaries, which have not increased since 2008."

On a recent morning, Diamond was leading a tour of his facility for a client named Gamal Omar, who had traveled to York, S.C., from Egypt for, among other things, some discount shopping. Omar owns a fabric-and-apparel-manufacturing business in 10th of Ramadan City, and like virtually everyone in the apparel business, he struggles with competition from Asia. Buying new machinery is out of Omar's budget, but older technologies bring productivity and quality problems. To remain competitive, he needs late-model textile machinery at used-car prices.

Picked up by Pakistani intelligence agents days after the Bin Laden raid a year ago and now in secret detention, the doctor, Shakil Afridi, has embodied the tensions between Washington and Islamabad. To some American officials he is a hero, worthy of praise and protection; Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has personally appealed for his release. But inside Pakistan's powerful military, still smarting from the raid on its soil, he is seen as a traitor who should face treason charges that could bring his execution. ''We need to make an example of him,'' one senior intelligence official said."

Turner Construction Company was founded in 1902 by Howard Turner's uncle, Henry Chandlee Turner. Born in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania in 1911, Howard graduated from George School in 1929, Swarthmore College in 1933, and MIT in 1936 with a PhD in organic chemistry. Upon graduation, Howard joined the DuPont Corporation as a research chemist. He then joined Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company in 1946 to lead their new research and development division. In 1954, Howard joined Jones & Laughlin Steel Company as the Vice President of research and development. Howard joined the Board of Directors of Turner Construction Company in 1952 and in 1965, was selected to serve as President of Turner Construction Company. He served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1968 to 1971 and Chairman of the Board from 1971 to 1978. From 1978 to 1982, he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. Under his leadership, the company grew from seven to twenty offices in cities across the United States, formalized its community affairs program, and established the Turner School of Construction Management for minorities and women. During this time the company also launched its international division with operations in four countries and the company's sales grew from $591 million in 1965 to $1.7 billion by 1978. On the occasion of Howard's retirement from Turner, he said, ""To lead this company, itself a leader among builders, has been an honor and an exciting opportunity for which I am most grateful. Turner has always been known for its depth of talent, regularly fed from the best of each year's college graduates. The company's growth will, as in the past, be based on the character and high standards of the Turner staff, its commitment to serve its clients and the satisfaction all Turner people feel in making a contribution to building lasting monuments of our civilization.""

Granted, it begins with a short burst of brassy dissonance, and altered versions of that gesture return during the slow, dark-hued overture that pours forth before the angel Raphael's serene narration of the familiar scene from Genesis: the formlessness of the earth, the darkness on the face of the waters. And when a second angel, Uriel, announces the creation of light, Haydn provides a magnificent explosion of C major orchestral timbre. Yet the salient musical features of this depiction are graceful melody and tonal harmony. To experience it as the primordial chaos Haydn intended, you need to imagine hearing it with 18th-century ears."
