1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: With every snowfall, New York City's parks are taken over by an army of sledders who swarm the hills, large and small. It is one of the less-heralded pleasures of city life; when snow crunches under the blades of your Flexible Flyer, the hustle and bustle of New York can seem very far away."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Time was when the managers of the Janus Capital mutual fund group paid scant attention to their customers. Cash-flow multiples and moving averages concerned them far more. But faced with persistent redemptions, Janus concluded in 1987 that performance alone wasn't enough. The marketing specialists came in, the advertising budget went up, and in 1989 the company's accounts doubled."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: AN unexpected byproduct of the weaker real estate market has been the return of the Veterans Administration mortgage as a popular financing tool, one that developers and sellers appear keener to honor than in the mid-80's, when sales were booming and any loan subject to possible bureaucratic delay was scorned."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Much has been made lately of Japan's entry into the luxury field, and Honda's Acura line did pave the way for Nissan's upscale Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus. But the truth is that the Japanese manufacturers have been tippy-toeing up that scale for some time, and their cars now cover the spectrum of buyers' wants."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: For years, he was the only American-born driver in Formula One racing and one of the few to have never raced in the Indianapolis 500. But in a shifting of gears, Eddie Cheever signed a multiyear contract Friday to drive an Indy-car for Chip Ganassi Racing."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The notion of decades sticks firmly in the mind. We speak of the 60's, or, more distantly, of the 20's and 30's as if they were sealed compartments. But time can't be tied up into parcels."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Every business depends on forecasting, whether its executives know it or not. How many new franchise stores should we open in 1990? Will we have enough cash on hand in November to pay expenses? Will our current staff be adequate to meet manufacturing demand in 1992? When do we need to reorder widgets?"
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: With consumer demand for silver sinking, silversmiths in the 80's started to cast about for other products that could benefit from their venerable names.

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: TO THE AVERAGE American high school student, science education is often a lesson in boredom. There are hundreds of technical terms to memorize, outdated books to plow through and teachers who drone on and on."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: We get the impression from the letters ['Dentists Fail to Smile in Response to ''Smile, Darn You, Smile,'' ' Dec. 24] that Barbara Klaus's article about dentists hit a nerve. Apparently there has been considerable erosion of the funny bone. Come, gentlemen, you must allow us our gibes as you laugh all the way to the bank."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: VERMONT earned the most from public college and university tuition for the 1988-89 academic year, collecting an average of almost $5,500 per student. A large number of students at Vermont's public colleges are from another state and therefore pay the higher nonresident tuition. California charged the lowest average tuition - about $500 per year."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,LEAD: A report on Dec. 10 about the marriage of Zerlina Stall and Dr. Edward J. Kaplan included outdated information on the officiating clergy. Rabbi Charles M. Feinberg performed the ceremony alone; Rabbi Erwin Zimet had become ill and has since died.

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: How much longer must New York City elections remain hobbled by outmoded manual voting machines prone to breakdowns? The decrepit booths should have been replaced years ago. Yet an indifferent Board of Elections still dawdles over the choice of a vendor for modern voting equipment. A 1985 study of the board's operations by the New York City Partnership, a coalition of civic-minded business leaders, set as a top priority the purchase of electronic voting equipment commonly used in other big cities."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: MOST Americans say they would personally pay an additional $200 a year in taxes to improve public education. Three-quarters of the 1,234 adults surveyed by the Gallup Poll said Federal spending on programs to improve public education should be increased. The poll found that the public supported increased spending on education even when the condition of higher taxes was added."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: With his knack for publicity, Richard Leakey became an important leader in the campaign to ban the sale of elephant ivory and crush a flourishing illegal international trade supported by poaching. Last October, with strong backing from the United States, a ban was adopted at a meeting of the 103 member countries of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (known as CITES and pronounced sight-ese) in Lausanne, Switzerland."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Twenty-three years ago, black American drama was not yet a part of the country's cultural milieu. Largely unwelcome on Broadway, black playwrights had their work confined mainly to a few Off Broadway and Harlem-based theaters. When the Negro Ensemble Company opened in Greenwich Village in 1967 - and in that inaugural year staged plays by Richard Wright and Wole Soyinka - it ushered black drama into the mainstream, helping to alter the nation's cultural landscape."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: We hardly knew each other. He and his wife had left the city, as we had, relocating to this small town in upstate New York with the idea of finding cleaner air and less noise and russet-colored dogs in russet-colored leaves. I had two young sons, he had three, and we shared the conviction that this small, clean, safe part of the world would insure our children ''a better way of life."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: FAILURE - a word fraught with emotion, easily spoken in daily conversation, but feared by the person to whom it is applied. Error, mistake, wrong, defeat, loss, all words that when directed at us evoke embarrassment and pain. We are trained and culturally conditioned to want to succeed, to be the best, to win."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: If the world needed one last sign of new warmth between East and West, it came last week. Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of the cold war's first general, President Eisenhower, announced her engagement to Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a former chief of the Soviet space program. The couple, who met at a conference on Soviet-American relations in 1987 and got to know each other better a year ago when she helped him work on his memoirs, admitted they had felt some trepidation about how officials in their countries would react."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: WHILE planning a recent hiking trip to New Zealand, I mulled the paradox of the Milford Track. The three-day trek from lake to sea is so renowned for its scenic glories that it's billed as ''the most beautiful walk in the world.'' But the Milford is also a popular tourist destination and is strictly controlled by the authorities."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Lower Manhattan is alive with mixed-media experiments, and ''Urchin 1,'' which ends a three-night run tonight at 8 at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, is an energetic example of that all-encompassing genre. But before it blasts into Lincoln Center orbit, so to speak (this is a science-fiction piece), it needs enriching."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Paulette Bates Alden wrote the article I had always wanted to write (''A Reluctant Education,'' Dec. 10). I have been through the same: post-coital tests, biopsies, nagging (or cajoling) my husband to have intercourse at what I estimated to be the precise moment of ovulation."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: An article on Nov. 26 about dining in Santa Fe misidentified the train station that is now Tomasita's; it was a station of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, not the Denver & Rio Grande. The article also misnamed a brand of beer; it is Negra Modelo."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: OUR daughter and only child is now a sophomore in college, but it is just recently that my husband and I have begun to realize exactly what that means.

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: To the Editor: It is always pleasing to have bed and breakfast accommodations spotlighted (''The New Bed and Breakfast'' by Eric N. Berg, Travel, Oct. 15). While the B & B's described by Mr. Berg are certainly a growing phenomenon across the country, traditional B & B's are hardly on their way out."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: It's a depositor's worst nightmare come true.

Below are answers to some commonly asked questions. Q. Who's in charge?"
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: The networks are competing more fiercely and frequently over the rights to titillating true stories. Lately, ABC and NBC have been duking it out over the life and death of Rock Hudson, the Hollywood star who died of AIDS in 1985. Last year, NBC announced plans for a biography and commissioned a script, but ABC quietly moved in and beat the peacock to the punch."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: When the All-Pro or Pro Bowl teams are chosen, some specialists are hailed for their skills. Place-kickers, punters, even special-team tacklers. But never a blocking back. Although success in football has been defined by coaches from Amos Alonzo Stagg to Bill Walsh as boiling down to blocking and tackling, there is no such species as the All-Pro blocking back or a Pro Bowl blocking back."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Like a man who appreciates equally a good joke at his expense and his ultimate vindication, Michael Roemer recalls the day in 1970 that he showed the movie he had just finished to executives of Columbia Pictures. Written and directed by Mr. Roemer, it is an intricate but low-key black-and-white comedy about a small-time Jewish racketeer called ''The Plot Against Harry."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Jazz, through much of its history, has been seen by critics, fans and musicians as sticking close to a simple progression, where one stylistic innovation follows another. And while the meaning of the change can be implied from as many critical angles as can be found - from Marxist or social criticism to psychoanalytical to formalist - the idea of a predominant style remains."
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A small seaside hotel and an adjoining waterfront residence on Ocean Avenue in Ocean Grove, N.J., are being rehabilitated into 11 condominium apartments. The Victorian-style hotel, built in 1870, and the home, built in 1920, had been used as rental apartment houses and had fallen into neglect when they were bought for $750,000 last summer by the Booth Development Company of Ridgewood, N.J."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Two decades ago, climbing skirt lengths produced a new kind of underpinning: panty hose. In this new decade, panty hose are again playing a key role, but now they are opaque tights, making the wearer feel less exposed in a short skirt or more pulled together, no matter the hem length."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: Beetle comes rushing into the room with the evening newspaper, displaying the banner headline: ''Ceausescu Toppled and Gone.'' Her proper name is Sylvia Betty, and she has been married to Frederic Raphael for 33 years. When she met him, she told him that Beetle was a family pet name and that he was to promise never to use it, but since his way of showing his love for things is to tell of their secrets, he has never called her anything else."

1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,LEAD: To the Editor: There are still a large number of reasonably priced B & B's in both urban and rural areas. There are plenty of people (probably the majority of B & B travelers) who are not looking for all those luxuries and amenities offered by these so-called bed and breakfast places. In my opinion such places should call themselves inns and omit the words bed and breakfast completely.
1990-01-07T00:00:00Z,"LEAD: A report in the Travel Advisory column on Nov. 26 about airline-ticket prepay charges referred incompletely to their use.

His Trump Shuttle raised its one-way weekday fares by an unprecedented 20 percent, to $119 from $99, thereby exacerbating the already excessive unrestricted air fare gouge that presently afflicts most of the nation's business (and many other) travelers."
