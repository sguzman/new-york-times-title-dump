Jack was born in Philadelphia, PA on December 8, 1932, and grew up in Elkins Park. He graduated St. Joseph's Prep class of 1950 and in 1954 from The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania. After serving two years in the US Army, he started his marketing career in Cincinnati at Proctor and Gamble. Several years later he made his way to Madison Avenue working for BBD&O, spending 12 years there rising to Executive Vice President and a Member of the Board. He managed accounts such as Gillette, American Tobacco, Pepsi Cola and many others. Working on the Gillette business in the 1960's, it was his idea to have Gillette sponsor Major League Baseball's All Star Game. It would be one of the major sponsorships undertaken in any professional sport. He then went to McCann-Erickson as a senior executive on the Miller Brewing Company account where he helped create a new category in the beer business. The successful marketing of ""Lite"" beer by the McCann-Erickson team changed the landscape of the beer business forever. After a few years he moved to the client side, eventually helping to form Sports Marketing Enterprises (SME), a division of RJ Reynolds Tobacco and the Nabisco Companies. He would be its first president. SME was responsible for the sponsorships of many RJR/Nabisco brands: the Vantage PGA Senior Golf Tour, the Winston Cup NASCAR Series, the Nabisco Tennis Championships as well as the Nabisco Dinah Shore LPGA Golf Championship. He retired in the early 1990's and moved to Hilton Head Island, SC. At the time of his death he was a popular member of Belfair Plantation, Bluffton, SC. He was an accomplished and well travelled golfer who enjoyed not only the sport but the camaraderie it provided with his many friends. He had been a member of many golf clubs including Winged Foot GC, Ridgewood CC. Long Cove Club and The Vintage Club. He is survived by his wife of 15 years Sally Ann Manning of Bluffton, SC, and by his sons, John of Tarrytown, NY, Christopher and his wife Linda, of Middlebury, CT, six grandchildren and one great grandchild, and his first wife, Rita Manning of Indian Wells, CA."
2014-11-07T00:00:00Z,"D'ATTILIO--Mary Theresa, ""Terry"", died on October 25, after a brief illness. With a Master's degree from Hunter College, Terry was a beloved teacher at PS 161 in Harlem. Terry redefined selflessness over her lifetime. Her love of life, walking in the woods, and thin crust pizza was rivaled only by her love of animals and children. She committed her whole life, both work and play, to helping animals and children in every way that she could. A celebration of her life will be held on November 8 at 11 am at Mallozzi's, Schenectady, NY. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in her name to Caring About the Strays, 3415 Leroy St, Schenectady, NY 12304 or Animal Protective Foundation, 53 Maple Ave, Scotia, NY 12302"

2014-11-08T00:00:00Z,"HARRIS--Jo Ann. The Robert B. Fiske, Jr. Association and the John S. Martin, Jr. Association mourn the passing of their beloved colleague, Jo Ann Harris. Ms. Harris epitomized the ideals of a generation of Assistant United States Attorneys, with her impeccable judgment, wise counsel, and generosity of soul. Her impish wit, unknown to many, could be deployed unexpectedly, always to perfect effect. Ms. Harris was a master of her craft. A fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, she played a central role in many of the most important federal criminal cases of the last 40 years. Always a leader, she became the first woman Executive Assistant in the US Attorneys Office, and served two stints in the Department of Justice, first as Chief of the Frauds Section and again in 1993 when President Clinton nominated Ms. Harris to be the first woman to head the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. For her exemplary service, Ms. Harris was awarded the Department of Justice Henry Peterson award, named for a legendary career attorney who presided over the Criminal Division during the turbulent Watergate years, protecting its integrity against political forces. As a testament to her reputation for incorruptibility and fairness, she was tapped by two separate Independent Counsels to conduct investigations in the early 1990s, Ms. Harris served as Associate Independent Counsel to Hon. Arlin Adams in his investigation of corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, in 2002, by Independent Counsel Robert Ray to investigate allegations of professional misconduct stemming from prosecutors' confrontation and interview of Monica Lewinsky. In addition to her extraordinary public service accomplishments, Ms. Harris was a master teacher and mentor. A member of the faculty at Pace University School of Law and the National Institute of Trial Advocacy, she was awarded NITA's prestigious Faculty Award. In the last two decades, she played a pivotal role in creating a tribal advocacy program for Native American tribal courts and chaired the Board for the Center for the Study of First Americans. In recent years, Ms. Harris devoted time to rock art in Siberia and digs at prehistoric flint mines in Montana and Wyoming. She was devoted to Shumla, a non-profit archeological research and educational center for Lower Pecos rock art in Comstock, Texas and served as a dedicated Vice President of its Board. We offer our condolences to her brother, Richard Murray, her stepdaughter, Liz Harris, her stepson, David Harris and her four grandchildren, who were the joy of her life. 1/3"

2014-11-09T00:00:00Z,"HENRY--William Barklie. Grandfather, father, husband, lover, musician, writer, seafarer, culinary artist, armchair shrink, practitioner of integrative medicine, and skillful driver of anything on wheels. Barklie Henry, who was all these things and much more to his family and friends, died at his home in the hills of Big Sur, California, on October 29, three weeks shy of his 87th birthday. Barklie's full and varied life transitioned as he wanted: in his living room overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the presence of people he loved and surrounded by family. William Barklie Henry was born on November 18, 1927, in New York City and raised on Long Island. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where he played bass in a jazz band and began his lifelong passion for music. At Princeton University he majored in philosophy and minored in late- night visits to the top jazz clubs in New York City where he played with numerous jazz luminaries. Barklie's multi- dimensional interests, ventures and pastimes over the past eight decades include: professional race car driver in the late 1950s; CIA intelligence analyst during the early years of the Cold War; influential member of the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art; filmmaker; and business entrepreneur. In the early 1970s, Barklie fell in love with Big Sur's rugged, unspoiled beauty. He studied at Esalen Institute before buying a hilltop property near Pfeiffer State Beach that became the center of his life for the next four decades. Barklie found the land and community in Big Sur a perfect fit for his Bohemian soul and his twin passions of healing arts and music. He launched and played percussion in two World Beat bands based in Big Sur -- ""Barefoot"", which featured renowned violinist Steve Kindler, and ""Dark Chocolate,"" an improvisational jazz-fusion ensemble. Their jam sessions and concerts drew loyal fans and ecstatic dancers and produced six CDs and popular success on the World Beat music charts. Barklie was predeceased by his parents, William M. ""Buzz"" Henry and Barbara Headley, and his sister, Gertrude Conner. The center of the last part of Barklie's life was his large family, who brought him great joy, as he did them. He is survived by his daughter, Linda Barnwell; his five sons, Eric, Bill, Jason, Laurence and Jules Henry ranging in age from 60 to 30; and seven grandchildren ranging in age from two to 29. 1/3"

Ms. Harris epitomized the ideals of a generation of Assistant United States Attorneys, with her impeccable judgment, wise counsel, and generosity of soul. Her impish wit, unknown to many, could be deployed unexpectedly, always to perfect effect. Ms. Harris was a master of her craft. A fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, she played a central role in many of the most important federal criminal cases of the last 40 years. Always a leader, she became the first woman Executive Assistant in the US Attorneys Office, and served two stints in the Department of Justice, first as Chief of the Frauds Section and again in 1993 when President Clinton nominated Ms. Harris to be the first woman to head the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. For her exemplary service, Ms. Harris was awarded the Department of Justice Henry Peterson award, named for a legendary career attorney who presided over the Criminal Division during the turbulent Watergate years, protecting its integrity against political forces. As a testament to her reputation for incorruptibility and fairness, she was tapped by two separate Independent Counsels to conduct investigations in the early 1990s, Ms. Harris served as Associate Independent Counsel to Hon. Arlin Adams in his investigation of corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, in 2002, by Independent Counsel Robert Ray to investigate allegations of professional misconduct stemming from prosecutors' confrontation and interview of Monica Lewinsky. In addition to her extraordinary public service accomplishments, Ms. Harris was a master teacher and mentor. A member of the faculty at Pace University School of Law and the National Institute of Trial Advocacy, she was awarded NITA's prestigious Faculty Award. In the last two decades, she played a pivotal role in creating a tribal advocacy program for Native American tribal courts and chaired the Board for the Center for the Study of First Americans. In recent years, Ms. Harris devoted time to rock art in Siberia and digs at prehistoric flint mines in Montana and Wyoming. She was devoted to Shumla, a non-profit archeological research and educational center for Lower Pecos rock art in Comstock, Texas and served as a dedicated Vice President of its Board. We offer our condolences to her brother, Richard Murray, her stepdaughter, Liz Harris, her stepson, David Harris and her four grandchildren, who were the joy of her life. 1/3"

2014-11-09T00:00:00Z,"BETTY GOES BANANAS Written and illustrated by Steve Antony. 24 pp. Schwartz & Wade. $16.99. (Picture book; ages 2 to 5) 
 
Frustration! When you’re a hungry baby gorilla and you see a banana, you want to eat it. But how does the darn thing open? Betty tries hands, teeth and feet, then brings out the big guns: wails, kicks and screams. It takes words of wisdom from a gentlemanly toucan, and a few false starts, before Betty gets her snack. This simple, close-up tale, brightly illustrated by Antony with crayonlike strokes of black with soft pink and yellow, speaks to the foot-stamping, banana-gobbling toddler in all of us."

The story of how Matisse came up with the ideas behind his cutouts (currently at MoMA in a rapturously reviewed show) makes for an ingenious picture book. As Amodeo’s collaged paper figure of the artist cuts out birds and then adds other objects, we see how shape creates feelings and memories. When he adds color, an entire personal world comes into being. Friedman’s spare text hits its marks perfectly, and foldout pages of Matisse cutouts provide an extra hit of happiness."

The latest in Raschka’s ingenious “Thingy Things” books — mini-homages to toddler logic — introduces Clammy Clam: a black outline and a few strategic peach and yellow brush strokes. “Say hello, Clammy Clam,” the narrator says. No dice; this mollusk stays clamped shut, even after a few entreaties and a sharp “Clammy Clam!” Like many a flummoxed parent, the narrator cries uncle, and the book ends where it started, with a resigned and suddenly funny “This is Clammy Clam.”"

2014-11-10T00:00:00Z,"LIPIN--Dr. Bernard. It is with great sadness that the family of Dr. Bernard Lipin mourns the passing of their dearest and beloved Bernie. Born and bred New Yorker, Dr. Lipin, 85, of Branford, CT, devoted husband of Joan Lipin, died at Yale-New Haven Hospital on Friday, November. 7, 2014 after complications from abdominal surgery. Born July 2, 1929, he was a son of the late Charles and Anna Lipin. Beloved Father of Hilary Dworkin of Potomac, MD, Steven (Amy) Lipin of NYC, Nancy (Michael O'Brien) Lipin of NYC, Jennifer Fennell of Fairfield, Abbie Fennell of Boston, MA, Lori (Mark) Ruthfield of Southborough, MA, and Stacy (Robert) Giglietti of Fairfield. Dear Brother of Martin Lipin of Los Angeles, CA. Bernie cherished his grandchildren Emily, Madeleine, Anna, Margot, Samuel, Hannah, Noah, Adam, Joshua and Zachary. Born to immigrants who sailed from Hamburg to Ellis Island in the early 1920s, Bernie grew up in the Morningside Heights section of Harlem, where his parents owned a tuxedo rental shop frequented by Columbia undergrads. A child of the Great Depression, a proud Korean War veteran who played the trumpet in a marching band stationed at Fort McPherson, Georgia, he was a beneficiary of the GI Bill, which helped him graduate from Long Island University with a Bachelors in speech pathology. He moved from the Bronx in 1963 to make a life for his family as a Beltone hearing-aid sales representative in New Haven, CT, and became a member of the health-care and small business community in his adopted home. But he always considered himself a New Yorker, which meant frequent visits and never paying for parking. Bernie was a vivacious lover of life, avid chronicler of life's moments photographically, and a devoted daily reader of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. He stressed education to all his children and was always about self-betterment. He obtained his Masters degree in audiology from Teacher's College at Columbia, a school whose shadows he grew up under, and eventually completed his PhD in audiology at the age of 78 from the AT Still University of Health Sciences. He somehow had time to take German along the way, benefiting from growing up hearing and speaking Yiddish at home. His charitable efforts were also about education: He was a nearly 50-year member of Rotary Club, and was very proud of the organization's commitment to providing college scholarships. He was a gourmet and foodie before the word existed, loving his Zabar's from its origins as a tiny storefront and introducing it to his kids and grandkids; his New Haven pizza; his visits to Chinatown and zeal for the next hot restaurant. He enjoyed traveling with his wife Joan around the world, whether it was Argentina, Alaska or a trip down the Danube. He cherished his summer birthdays and wedding anniversaries in Montauk with Joan, his children, grandchildren and close friends, and began to enjoy winters in Boca Raton. He was a dapper man and indeed one of the earliest known shopaholics who had a keen sense of fashion and style, and was always decked out to a T. He never took anything for granted, loved life, and life loved him back. Funeral Services at Congregation Mishkan Israel, 785 Ridge Rd., Hamden, CT, Monday, November 10 afternoon at 1:30pm with Interment Services to follow at the Mishkan Israel Cemetery, Jewell St., New Haven. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to Rotary Scholarship Fund (New Haven) and Mishkan Israel."

Hal was the center of our universe as we were the constellation of his. Hal's sense of adventure and duty led him to many ports of call as a Pharmacist's Mate First Class in the Navy during WWII. He afterward owned and operated Foster's Pharmacy in Bedford Stuyvesant, where he was a fixture and beloved member of that community for over thirty years. Hal was a handsome man with beautiful, empathetic eyes and an uncomplicated joy in his life that endeared him to all who fell within the orbit of his gaze. He could do anything and do it well and we depended upon his quiet competence for the safety of our world. Hal's life was defined by his love for his family: Essie, his wife of almost 64 years, his five children Michael, Stacy, Tamar, Rafe, and Jody, and his eight grandchildren. This happiness was immutably altered in 2003 with the untimely death of his youngest son, Rafe, and again in 2012 with the death of his eldest son, Michael.

2014-11-11T00:00:00Z,"LIPIN--Dr. Bernard. It is with great sadness that the family of Dr. Bernard Lipin mourns the passing of their dearest and beloved Bernie. Born and bred New Yorker, Dr. Lipin, 85, of Branford, CT, devoted husband of Joan Lipin, died at Yale-New Haven Hospital on Friday, November. 7, 2014 after complications from abdominal surgery. Born July 2, 1929, he was a son of the late Charles and Anna Lipin. Beloved Father of Hilary Dworkin of Potomac, MD, Steven (Amy) Lipin of NYC, Nancy (Michael O'Brien) Lipin of NYC, Jennifer Fennell of Fairfield, Abbie Fennell of Boston, MA, Lori (Mark) Ruthfield of Southborough, MA, and Stacy (Robert) Giglietti of Fairfield. Dear Brother of Martin Lipin of Los Angeles, CA. Bernie cherished his grandchildren Emily, Madeleine, Anna, Margot, Samuel, Hannah, Noah, Adam, Joshua and Zachary. Born to immigrants who sailed from Hamburg to Ellis Island in the early 1920s, Bernie grew up in the Morningside Heights section of Harlem, where his parents owned a tuxedo rental shop frequented by Columbia undergrads. A child of the Great Depression, a proud Korean War veteran who played the trumpet in a marching band stationed at Fort McPherson, Georgia, he was a beneficiary of the GI Bill, which helped him graduate from Long Island University with a Bachelors in speech pathology. He moved from the Bronx in 1963 to make a life for his family as a Beltone hearing-aid sales representative in New Haven, CT, and became a member of the health-care and small business community in his adopted home. But he always considered himself a New Yorker, which meant frequent visits and never paying for parking. Bernie was a vivacious lover of life, avid chronicler of life's moments photographically, and a devoted daily reader of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal. He stressed education to all his children and was always about self-betterment. He obtained his Masters degree in audiology from Teacher's College at Columbia, a school whose shadows he grew up under, and eventually completed his PhD in audiology at the age of 78 from the AT Still University of Health Sciences. He somehow had time to take German along the way, benefiting from growing up hearing and speaking Yiddish at home. His charitable efforts were also about education: He was a nearly 50-year member of Rotary Club, and was very proud of the organization's commitment to providing college scholarships. He was a gourmet and foodie before the word existed, loving his Zabar's from its origins as a tiny storefront and introducing it to his kids and grandkids; his New Haven pizza; his visits to Chinatown and zeal for the next hot restaurant. He enjoyed traveling with his wife Joan around the world, whether it was Argentina, Alaska or a trip down the Danube. He cherished his summer birthdays and wedding anniversaries in Montauk with Joan, his children, grandchildren and close friends, and began to enjoy winters in Boca Raton. He was a dapper man and indeed one of the earliest known shopaholics who had a keen sense of fashion and style, and was always decked out to a T. He never took anything for granted, loved life, and life loved him back. Funeral Services at Congregation Mishkan Israel, 785 Ridge Rd., Hamden, CT, Monday, November 10 afternoon at 1:30pm with Interment Services to follow at the Mishkan Israel Cemetery, Jewell St., New Haven. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to Rotary Scholarship Fund (New Haven) and Mishkan Israel."

2014-11-13T00:00:00Z,"BADER--Deirdre Russell, (nee Murphy), beloved wife of Lawrence S. Bader, adoring mother of Ethan Russell Bader, cherished daughter of Daniel Murphy and Sally Kandle, passed away peacefully on November 11, 2014 at the Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. Deirdre was the Executive Director of Star Track, a cycling charity for New York City children between the ages of 7 and 14. Using the City's outdoor velodrome in Kessina Park in Queens, Deirdre founded the charity in connection with New York's bid for the 2012 Olympic games and led Star Track's growth over the past 12 years to the point where, in this year, 300 children were enrolled in Star Track, with a long waiting list. Star Track is a free program that teaches children how to ride specialized bicycles designed for competition on banked tracks called velodromes. It was Deirdre's hope that by learning to ride on a velodrome, the children could develop fitness, self-esteem and teamwork. Deirdre's involvement in competitive cycling began when she was 32 years old, and she retired at the age of 41, having just competed for Ireland in the women's road race in the Sydney Australia Olympics. Deirdre was born and raised in New York City, and while in high school, obtained Irish citizenship at the urging of her father. Years later, representing Ireland, Deirdre raced against international competition in Montevideo, Uruguay in a qualifying race to determine which countries could send their road cycling competitors to the 2000 Olympics. By finishing fourth in that race, Deirdre qualified Ireland to send its first woman road cyclist ever to the Olympics. Deirdre was also the Women's World Masters champion in 1997 for all women over 30 years old, earning her the coveted ""Rainbow Jersey"" worn by the reigning world's champion in one of cycling's disciplines --in her case, the road race. In her career, she won 81 races. Deirdre married her husband, Lawrence in 2002 and gave birth to their son, Ethan, in 2007. Deirdre was an extraordinarily beautiful woman who embodied generosity of spirit, warmth, loyalty, competitiveness and intelligence. She will be missed terribly by all who knew her. It was her request that in lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory be made to Star Track at ""Bike New York/Star Track"", 12 East 87th Street, New York, N.Y. 10128. A funeral service will be held at The Brick Presbyterian Church at 1140 Park Avenue on Saturday, November 15 at 11am, followed by a reception. 1/3"

Deirdre was a devoted and loving mother to their son Ethan, a talented and accomplished athlete, a generous champion of Star Track, a charity that brings the sport of competitive cycling to children of New York City, and a cherished friend to all at our firm. 1/3"
2014-11-14T00:00:00Z,"BADER--Deirdre Russell, (nee Murphy), beloved wife of Lawrence S. Bader, adoring mother of Ethan Russell Bader, cherished daughter of Daniel Murphy and Sally Kandle, passed away peacefully on November 11, 2014 at the Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. Deirdre was the Executive Director of Star Track, a cycling charity for New York City children between the ages of 7 and 14. Using the City's outdoor velodrome in Kessina Park in Queens, Deirdre founded the charity in connection with New York's bid for the 2012 Olympic games and led Star Track's growth over the past 12 years to the point where, in this year, 300 children were enrolled in Star Track, with a long waiting list. Star Track is a free program that teaches children how to ride specialized bicycles designed for competition on banked tracks called velodromes. It was Deirdre's hope that by learning to ride on a velodrome, the children could develop fitness, self-esteem and teamwork. Deirdre's involvement in competitive cycling began when she was 32 years old, and she retired at the age of 41, having just competed for Ireland in the women's road race in the Sydney Australia Olympics. Deirdre was born and raised in New York City, and while in high school, obtained Irish citizenship at the urging of her father. Years later, representing Ireland, Deirdre raced against international competition in Montevideo, Uruguay in a qualifying race to determine which countries could send their road cycling competitors to the 2000 Olympics. By finishing fourth in that race, Deirdre qualified Ireland to send its first woman road cyclist ever to the Olympics. Deirdre was also the Women's World Masters champion in 1997 for all women over 30 years old, earning her the coveted ""Rainbow Jersey"" worn by the reigning world's champion in one of cycling's disciplines --in her case, the road race. In her career, she won 81 races. Deirdre married her husband, Lawrence in 2002 and gave birth to their son, Ethan, in 2007. Deirdre was an extraordinarily beautiful woman who embodied generosity of spirit, warmth, loyalty, competitiveness and intelligence. She will be missed terribly by all who knew her. It was her request that in lieu of flowers, contributions in her memory be made to Star Track at ""Bike New York/Star Track"", 12 East 87th Street, New York, N.Y. 10128. A funeral service will be held at The Brick Presbyterian Church at 1140 Park Avenue on Saturday, November 15 at 11am, followed by a reception. 1/3"

2014-11-17T00:00:00Z,"SELLERS--Peter H. The Rockefeller University mourns the loss of our distinguished colleague and cherished friend Peter Sellers. A brilliant and pioneering mathematician whose research contributed significantly to the first computer search/ matching algorithm for DNA, Dr. Sellers joined the faculty of The Rockefeller University in 1966. Through more than four decades at the University, he conducted research at the intersection of mathematics and biology. During the 1970s and 1980s, work from the Sellers lab led to the development of BLAST, a widely used computerized DNA and protein database search program. Peter was a true Renaissance man, with a broad range of scientific and cultural interests and the rare ability to draw cogent connections across disciplines. With Lucy Bell, his beloved wife of nearly 60 years, Peter enriched the intellectual life of our campus community. Notably, he preserved and enhanced the University's Merrill W. Chase Historic Scientific Instrument Collection, of which he was curator. Beyond Rockefeller, Peter and Lucy Bell contributed to the cultural vibrancy of Mount Desert Island, Maine, where they summered and where they worked to protect the environment and the natural beauty of the coastline. A longtime trustee of the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Peter was also an accomplished sailor, who designed and built his own sailboat. In recognition of Peter's significant contributions to the biological sciences, the University has established a new lectureship in mathematics in his honor. We will miss Peter's unique blend of scientific brilliance, creativity, and personal warmth, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Lucy Bell; to Peter and Lucy Bell's children, Mortimer, Therese, Wanja, and Lucy Bell; and to the entire Sellers family.

2014-11-18T00:00:00Z,"SELLERS--Peter H. The Rockefeller University mourns the loss of our distinguished colleague and cherished friend Peter Sellers. A brilliant and pioneering mathematician whose research contributed significantly to the first computer search/ matching algorithm for DNA, Dr. Sellers joined the faculty of The Rockefeller University in 1966. Through more than four decades at the University, he conducted research at the intersection of mathematics and biology. During the 1970s and 1980s, work from the Sellers lab led to the development of BLAST, a widely used computerized DNA and protein database search program. Peter was a true Renaissance man, with a broad range of scientific and cultural interests and the rare ability to draw cogent connections across disciplines. With Lucy Bell, his beloved wife of nearly 60 years, Peter enriched the intellectual life of our campus community. Notably, he preserved and enhanced the University's Merrill W. Chase Historic Scientific Instrument Collection, of which he was curator. Beyond Rockefeller, Peter and Lucy Bell contributed to the cultural vibrancy of Mount Desert Island, Maine, where they summered and where they worked to protect the environment and the natural beauty of the coastline. A longtime trustee of the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Peter was also an accomplished sailor, who designed and built his own sailboat. In recognition of Peter's significant contributions to the biological sciences, the University has established a new lectureship in mathematics in his honor. We will miss Peter's unique blend of scientific brilliance, creativity, and personal warmth, and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Lucy Bell; to Peter and Lucy Bell's children, Mortimer, Therese, Wanja, and Lucy Bell; and to the entire Sellers family.

Hyman, Chairman of the Institute since 2008 and a Trustee since 2007. Mr. Hyman, age 78, died peacefully on Monday, November 17, in New York City with his family by his side. He is survived by his loving wife of 35 years, Chris Stern Hyman; his son, David; his daughter, Sarah; and son- in-law, Andy; and, his grandchildren, Zoe and Henry. We at Sabin owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Mr. Hyman for his visionary contributions. He was a tower of strength and energy who provided unparalleled leadership, driven by a deep passion for improving public health. Under his leadership, Sabin enjoyed tremendous growth including new long- term collaborations with Houston's Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine. These led to the creation of a new Center for Vaccine Development, greatly expanding our vaccine development portfolio, and the founding of the National School of Tropical Medicine. Constantly looking for ways to expand Sabin's impact, Mr. Hyman was also instrumental in establishing our sister organization in London, England, Sabin Foundation Europe, for which he also served as Chairman. In addition to his many other philanthropic pursuits supporting public health improvements, Mr. Hyman was an ardent champion for the development of the first vaccine for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that plagues 250 million people, led by the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership. Thanks to Mr. Hyman's support, that vaccine candidate currently is entering clinical trials. The Sabin team will strive to repay our debt of gratitude to Mr. Hyman by ensuring that his legacies not only endure, but as rapidly as possible fulfill his hopes of the widespread reduction of needless suffering by the neglected and underserved populations around the world. The Hyman family has asked friends and admirers interested in honoring Mr. Hyman to donate to the Sabin Vaccine Institute or Mount Sinai Health System. Philip K.

Hyman, Chairman of the Institute since 2008 and a Trustee since 2007. Mr. Hyman, age 78, died peacefully on Monday, November 17, in New York City with his family by his side. He is survived by his loving wife of 35 years, Chris Stern Hyman; his son, David; his daughter, Sarah; and son- in-law, Andy; and, his grandchildren, Zoe and Henry. We at Sabin owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Mr. Hyman for his visionary contributions. He was a tower of strength and energy who provided unparalleled leadership, driven by a deep passion for improving public health. Under his leadership, Sabin enjoyed tremendous growth including new long- term collaborations with Houston's Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine. These led to the creation of a new Center for Vaccine Development, greatly expanding our vaccine development portfolio, and the founding of the National School of Tropical Medicine. Constantly looking for ways to expand Sabin's impact, Mr. Hyman was also instrumental in establishing our sister organization in London, England, Sabin Foundation Europe, for which he also served as Chairman. In addition to his many other philanthropic pursuits supporting public health improvements, Mr. Hyman was an ardent champion for the development of the first vaccine for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that plagues 250 million people, led by the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership. Thanks to Mr. Hyman's support, that vaccine candidate currently is entering clinical trials. The Sabin team will strive to repay our debt of gratitude to Mr. Hyman by ensuring that his legacies not only endure, but as rapidly as possible fulfill his hopes of the widespread reduction of needless suffering by the neglected and underserved populations around the world.

He was born on April 23, 1924, in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England to John Anthony Griffin and Hilda Vizetelly. Mr. Griffin voluntarily enlisted in the Royal Air Force on the day he was old enough to join and was part of the Greatest Generation that fought World War II. He served during the Allied Forces invasion of Normandy and was frequently involved in air-to-air combat as he flew night missions in Lancaster bombers. He was a courageous, patriotic man who had an unwavering sense of right and wrong. He met his wife, the late Dr. Alice V. Griffin, while she was studying at Stratford-upon-Avon and he was working nearby as an air traffic controller. A mutual love of Shakespeare brought them together and became a shared passion for the rest of their lives. The couple married in 1952 at City Hall in New York City and soon thereafter began their radio show, ""Sidewalk Critics Review,"" where they would broadcast live reviews after the openings of new plays and musicals on Broadway. He took on the roles of homemaker, community volunteer and soccer organizer as his wife's career accelerated. Mr. Griffin loved soccer, and in the late 1960s was an early organizing force behind the Westchester Youth Soccer League, now one of the nation's largest with over 20,000 registered players. He trained other fathers to become coaches and recruited referees from a pool of new Americans. Mr. Griffin fulfilled a lifelong dream in 1998 when he attended the World Cup final, witnessing France's victory over Brazil.

2014-11-23T00:00:00Z,"SPOOR--William 1923 - 2014. William (Billy) Howard Spoor, retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Pillsbury Company, died on November 14, 2014 at his home in Salt Lake City, UT, surrounded by family. He died exactly as he lived, with tremendous grace, great dignity and on his own terms. While our hearts are broken by the idea of life without him, he and our mother, who passed before him, are still very much with us. Our father's incredible work ethic, sense of humor and love of life are at the heart of everything he did. We have all been influenced by his values and spirit. Bill was born January 16, 1923 in Pueblo, CO to Doris Slaughter Spoor and Charles Hinchman Spoor. The family eventually moved to Denver, where he was raised. In 1941, Bill was accepted to Dartmouth College on a full athletic scholarship. He was an incredibly gifted athlete and a fierce competitor. He excelled in all sports, especially football and track and field. In 1942, he volunteered for the US Army's 10th Mountain Division. Bill trained at Camp Hale and spent 3 1/2 years in the Army. Even as a young soldier, his leadership abilities were clearly evident. Instead of being sent overseas with his division, Bill was ordered to officer candidate school. After the war, Bill returned to Dartmouth where he received his degree in history and education in 1949. It was at Dartmouth that he met the love of his life Janet Spain, a student at Smith College. From that moment forward, she would become the most important person in his life. He would forever be ""Billy"" to her. Bill was often heard saying that ""I make the living and Jan makes the living worthwhile."" They were married in NYC on September 23, 1950 and embarked on what was to become, an extraordinary life. After graduating from Dartmouth, Bill began his career with The Pillsbury Company. For more than 20 years Bill focused on his internationalist vision and values, first as Area Sales Manager of Pillsbury's Export Division (New York) and later as Vice President and General Manager of International Operations. He was transferred from New York to Minnesota in 1962. In 1973, he was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Pillsbury. Bill ran Pillsbury from 1973 until 1985, returning briefly to both positions in 1988. Bill and his team not only brought Pillsbury great profitability, but they ensured it was shared with others. ""Our success as a company fueled our ability to give,"" he said. ""This enabled us to fully fund The Pillsbury Company Foundation and routinely contribute four percent of our domestic taxable income."" Under Bill's leadership, Pillsbury grew dramatically. Much of the growth came through acquisitions, most significantly Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs, Totino's Pizza, Steak & Ale, Godfather's Pizza, American Beauty Macaroni, Van de Kamps and Bumble Bee Tuna, and through the expansion of Burger King. At the time Bill became Chairman and CEO in 1973, Pillsbury sales were $816 million annually, profits were $20 million and earnings per share were $1.60. When he retired from Pillsbury in 1985, sales had grown more than fivefold to $4.7 billion. Profits were $192 million, and earning per share were $4.42. It was, he said, ""a very different company"" when he left. Bill was generous with his time and his good fortune. He served as director and executive committee member of the United Negro College Fund. He helped raise $32 million for the Minnesota Orchestral Association. He served on the executive committee of the Minnesota Historical Society, as a director of the Minneapolis based Inner City Tennis and as chairman of the YWCA Tribute to Women in International Industry. He was also a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award in 1986. Bill enjoyed his work as head of the Capitol City Renaissance Program task force, appointed in 1985 by Gov. Rudy Perpich, to develop a plan for redesigning the area around the Minnesota Capitol. He also served on the National Cambodia Crisis Committee, on the board of the Foundation for Management Education in Central America. He served on the boards of directors of Northwest Bancorporation, Northwestern National Bank, Honeywell, Inc., Dayton-Hudson Corporation, Berkley & Company, Inc., Piper, Jaffray incorporated, The Coleman Company and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts - Las Vegas. Bill's degree from Dartmouth College was one of his most treasured accomplishments. He demonstrated his appreciation in a variety of ways. In return, Bill was honored by Dartmouth with its Presidential medal for Outstanding Leadership and Achievement. He was closely involved with the Dartmouth Dialogues on Leadership, a program established by Pillsbury in his name. His work for Dartmouth and other institutions of learning brought election to Phi Beta Kappa. In 2005, Jan and Bill moved from their Wayzata, MN home of 40 years to Salt Lake City to be closer to their children and grandchildren. An avid fisherman, he and Jan spent many happy hours fishing in Colorado, Minnesota and their beloved Saratoga, WY. He enriched the lives of everyone he touched through his generosity, quick wit, integrity and loyalty. Bill was a larger than life presence, ingenious at turning a phrase, clever and funny beyond measure and lived his life honorably. Bill was preceded in death by his beautiful and loving wife of 63 years, Janet Spain Spoor; his parents Doris Slaughter Spoor, Charles Hinchman Spoor; his sister Dorothy Spoor Arnold and brother Charles Hinchman Spoor, Jr. He is survived by his children Melanie Grace Spoor, Cynthia Field Spoor (Douglas Howard), William Lincoln Spoor (Sarah), six grandchildren: Charles Spoor Howard, Anna Grace Howard, Blakely Madison Spoor, Savannah Spain Spoor, William Walker Spoor and Lincoln Campbell Spoor; his brother T.

In 1938 his family fled Nazi Germany and settled in Berkeley, California. A veteran of World War II, he was educated at the University of California at Berkeley and received his doctorate in the history of art under Johannes Wilde from the Courtauld Institute, University of London, in 1958. In that year he joined the art history faculty at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1968 he was appointed professor and chairman of the art department at Brown University, retiring in 1995 as Andrea K. Rosenthal Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership, the department became an important center for both graduate and undergraduate instruction in the history of art and architecture; he was greatly loved by students and colleagues alike. His abundant research focused on Medieval and Renaissance Venice, resulting in books and articles on Venetian Romanesque palaces, painted ceilings of the Renaissance, and printed maps, plans, and views of Venice. He was awarded fellowships by the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fulbright Committee, the NEH, and the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton and was a member of the Ateneo Veneto. For his contribution to the rescue of Italian art after the floods of 1966, he was designated Grande Ufficiale of the Ordine della Stella della Solidarieta della Repubblica Italiana. From 1984 he was an active member on the scientific council of the Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura ""Andrea Palladio"" at Vicenza. In 2000-2001 he was Samuel H. Kress Professor at the National Gallery of Art, Washington.

She left us peacefully on November 24th surrounded by her children and grandchildren, who all adored her. Born May 7, 1928 to Mark and Jeanette Sloman, she shared 57 years of marital bliss with Marty Kay, who predeceased her in 2009. Together, they formed a dynamic duo that raised the bar for partnership and affection. Dickie's legacy is the selflessness, compassion, generosity, kindness, respect, and patience she gave unconditionally to everyone she encountered in all the roles she served: wife, mother, Nannie, great-grandmother, friend, volunteer, and acquaintance. The legacy she and Marty were proudest of was their family: children Patty, Peter and Kathy, their spouses, 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. While most of her days were devoted to giving time to others, she did manage to squeeze in a few moments for needlepoint, gardening, Judge Judy, Fox News and her collections of antique pillboxes and pitchers. A lifelong volunteer, she was a 2013 inductee into the Westchester County Department of Senior Programs and Services Hall of Fame. Dickie will always be in the hearts and minds of those lucky and blessed enough to have known her.

2014-11-26T00:00:00Z,"CALDON--Walter. Walter Caldon, of New York, NY died on Saturday, November 22. He was 92 years old and lived near Lincoln Center. After a brief illness he died peacefully in hospice at Mt. Sinai hospital in Manhattan after sustaining a head injury in a fall at the hospital. Mr. Caldon was born in Staten Island, NY. His parents, Ida Dissen(a), born in Vitebsk, and Samuel Kaldovsky, born in Kiev, emigrated to the U.S. in the first years of the 20th century. He was the youngest of three children that included the late Ruth Levine (1907-1973) and Frances Gold (1916-2000). He is survived by his sisters' children, grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Before the war, Mr. Caldon studied at Brooklyn College and The Art Students League. He then served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1946. In recognition of his academic potential, he was selected to complete a program in Civil Engineering at Rutgers University in 1943-44 under U.S. Army sponsorship. After the war, he completed a B.S. and M.A. in Fine Arts with a minor in Music at Columbia University and subsequently a Diplome at the Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris where he studied under composer Artur Honegger. From 1952-1973, he worked as a Civil Engineer for the New York City Housing Authority. He worked on high-rise construction during a period of great postwar expansion of the Authority. Mr. Caldon lived for over 50 years in a townhouse in Greenwich Village. After he stopped working, he also spent time at a weekend home in Southold, NY. His lengthy retirement included several extended stays in his beloved Paris as well as composing music for performing arts productions and painting. He wrote musical scores for the Living Theater, the Open Theater, The Martha Graham Dance Company and The Actors Studio among others. His paintings were featured in American Artist in August 1975 and in one-man gallery shows in Paris and New York. His work is represented in corporate and private collections in New York, Germany and France. Many of the paintings depict urban scenes, often evoking a sense of the sublime or mysterious in otherwise familiar surroundings. There would be many piquant episodes to relate. In the early 1970s, Mr. Caldon was known to leash- walk his pet capuchin monkey around the Village in diapers. As if that weren't enough, he also enjoyed smuggling the monkey into the movies inside his shirt where she would sleep blissfully until the credits rolled. One week something alarmed the monkey and she went free-range in a crowded Manhattan movie house during the second reel. The rest of the story is perhaps best left to the imagination. He was fiercely independent until the end of his life. He was grateful for the help of friends but he often confounded them by not accepting even the most basic services that make life here less arduous. On the day of his fall, he rode two buses to the hospital when he could have easily paid for the cab ride across town. He was an intense, witty friend whose sense of humor and wonderment at simple details that most of us fail to notice are missed by those fortunate enough to have known him. You could have fun in even the most dismal surroundings if you could only catch his eye. The flaws in our English and French syntax shall hereafter go uncorrected. There will be a Memorial at a future date. 1/3"

2014-11-27T00:00:00Z,"STOECKLEIN--David R. 1949-2014. Legendary photographer David R. Stoecklein left his mark on our world in more ways than one. The son of Bernard and Dorothy and brother of Buzzy, Julie, Walter and Debbie Stoecklein, he was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1949. During his early twenties he headed west to pursue his passion for photography. David met Mary Jagger in 1976 and after moving to Sun Valley, Idaho, they married and were blessed with three boys-- Drew, Taylor and Colby. Everyone who knew David also understood that he was completely in love and devoted as a husband, a father and friend to all. David's images dominated the ski and outdoor industry, but his contribution to advertising made him one of the most sought after photographers in the business. He worked with Chevrolet and Jeep to Marlboro and Stetson, Canon USA and Epson, Coca Cola and Bayer to name a few. His passion was in documenting the cowboy way of life and the men and women who knew a thing or two about hard work and making an honest living. David lived by the code of the West. In fact he provided the photographs and publishing for the book Cowboy Ethics. His word was worth gold, and his handshake meant everything. He finished what he started, spoke his peace, but always listened first. He worked hard, played hard, and always made a stranger feel welcome. He was both tough and tender, and his life has inspired countless others. The iconic American Western photographer was much loved and admired for his gregarious character and passion for life. His photographs will forever be a tribute to his talents and his spirit will live on in all those whose lives he graced. He remains legendary. In his honor, Mary and her three sons have established the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation. It is a charitable organization designed to provide help to causes David cared so much for--such as providing scholarships to aspiring photography students and to helping cowboys and cowgirls in need. The Stoecklein family would like to continue David's legacy of education and generosity for generations to come. Memorial donations in memory of David may be made to the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation in care of Attorney Brian Barsotti, P.O. Box 370, Ketchum, ID 83340.

Beverly Reynolds, who was a devoted wife, loving mother, mischievous grandmother and the Founder and Director of the Reynolds Gallery in Richmond, VA, died on November 23 at her home. She was 68. Beverly was a driving force in creating a vibrant contemporary arts community in Richmond and lived a life of style, substance, and spirit. She was gifted, generous, tenacious, tough, curious, opinionated, tender- hearted, compassionate, creative and committed to making a difference and a contribution. She laughed easily and delighted in creating places and opportunities for family and friends to spend time together. Bev loved life and the people in it with her, especially her family. Beverly Lynn was born in Wilmington, DE to Dudley and Alice Ward, both natives of Canada, on July 13, 1946. She was raised in Chicago and Washington. After graduating from the University of Tennessee, the always-adventurous Bev headed to New York City where she met the charming David Reynolds. They were married on December 13, 1969 and were devoted to each other for forty-five years. While living on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for eight years, Bev joined the docent program at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and soon met art dealer Jeanne Frank, who hired Bev to work in her gallery and who became a lifelong mentor. Bev founded Reynolds Gallery in Richmond in 1977. Early sales of works by Alexander Calder, Ellsworth Kelly, and Max Ernst gave her ""the courage to dream that a gallery based on a New York model might work in Richmond."" And it has. Today, the Reynolds Gallery is one of the most respected contemporary art galleries in the country. Bev was a visionary and tireless leader in the effort to create the Institute for Contemporary Art at Virginia Commonwealth University, designed by Steven Holl and scheduled to open in 2016. The first floor gallery has been named in her honor. While living in Richmond, Beverly always had a second spiritual home in Manhattan. She traveled to New York several times a year for over thirty years, and loved the vibrancy, creativity and constant change of New York. She brought famous New York based artists to Richmond and brought Virginia based artist to world prominence in New York. She rejoiced in the crowded bustle of Madison Avenue and quite contemplation in the Metropolitan Museum, particularly during the holidays. Bev is survived by her husband, David, and her four children: Quentin and his wife, Sarah; Alec and his wife, Laura; Alice Livingston and her husband, Mac; and Margaret Jones and her husband, Will. She is predeceased by their first son, David. She was ""Bevie"" to her nine beautiful grandchildren (Caldwell, Quinn, Jackson, Pierce, Elliott, Griffin, William, Helen and Lillian), all of whom will carry on her spirit and joy for life. Bev adored her sister Dianne English and her husband, Roger, and her brother, Dr. John A. D. Ward and his wife, Pam. A memorial service will be held at 11am, Saturday, November 29, at St. James's Episcopal Church, 1205 W, Franklin St., Richmond, VA. The family requests gifts be made in memory of Bev to either the Institute for Contemporary Art at VCU (www.ica.vcu.edu) or the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (www.ocrf.org); in lieu of flowers. 1/3"

2014-11-30T00:00:00Z,"STOECKLEIN--David R. 1949-2014. Legendary photographer David R. Stoecklein left his mark on our world in more ways than one. The son of Bernard and Dorothy and brother of Buzzy, Julie, Walter and Debbie Stoecklein, he was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1949. During his early twenties he headed west to pursue his passion for photography. David met Mary Jagger in 1976 and after moving to Sun Valley, Idaho, they married and were blessed with three boys-- Drew, Taylor and Colby. Everyone who knew David also understood that he was completely in love and devoted as a husband, a father and friend to all. David's images dominated the ski and outdoor industry, but his contribution to advertising made him one of the most sought after photographers in the business. He worked with Chevrolet and Jeep to Marlboro and Stetson, Canon USA and Epson, Coca Cola and Bayer to name a few. His passion was in documenting the cowboy way of life and the men and women who knew a thing or two about hard work and making an honest living. David lived by the code of the West. In fact he provided the photographs and publishing for the book Cowboy Ethics. His word was worth gold, and his handshake meant everything. He finished what he started, spoke his peace, but always listened first. He worked hard, played hard, and always made a stranger feel welcome. He was both tough and tender, and his life has inspired countless others. The iconic American Western photographer was much loved and admired for his gregarious character and passion for life. His photographs will forever be a tribute to his talents and his spirit will live on in all those whose lives he graced. He remains legendary. In his honor, Mary and her three sons have established the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation. It is a charitable organization designed to provide help to causes David cared so much for--such as providing scholarships to aspiring photography students and to helping cowboys and cowgirls in need. The Stoecklein family would like to continue David's legacy of education and generosity for generations to come. Memorial donations in memory of David may be made to the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation in care of Attorney Brian Barsotti, P.O. Box 370, Ketchum, ID 83340.

He was born May 10, 1925 in Bronx, New York, attended school in Brooklyn, New York and then graduated from George Washington University School of Pharmacy in Washington, DC, receiving the prestigious Merck award and graduating number one in his class. He and his wife were married for 61 years and have lived in the Saint Petersburg area of Florida for 31 years. He was the consummate professional pharmacist--""Doc"" to everyone who sought his advice. His daughter garnered her love of pharmacology from him. He owned his own pharmacy, together with his wife, for approximately 26 years in Silver Spring, Maryland and then again in Glassell Park, Los Angeles, California for three years, before relocating to Florida, where he worked for multiple pharmacy chains in various supervisory capacities. He was an avid tennis player and formidable opponent until about age 75, where he had nicknames such as ""get-em-back-Jack"" and ""crazylegs"". His favorite line --nothing ventured, nothing gained --has been a Goldberg family mantra; this simple saying has often borne fruit for the family. Jack was a decorated Veteran with the US Army Air Force, having served during World War II and received the American Theater Service Ribbon, Good Conduct Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.

Russell, 16th Commandant of the Marine Corps, Tony was first and always a Marine. Tony loved animals as much as people and was a talented wildlife photographer working for both for National Geographic magazine and World Books Encyclopedia in the 1950's and 1960's, an early conservationist, author of seven books and a highly respected three- time United States Ambassador. Tony very much loved his three stepchildren, Arden, Inness and Robert and three step-grandchildren James, Lyon and Weston who showered him with love, affection and respect particularly his stepson Robert with whom he formed an everlasting and most loving bond. During the course of his life, he helped countless young people get their own start in life by introducing them to those who could provide internships or jobs or sometimes he would write a check to tide one over until they could make it on their own. And then he relished in their success. Tony served his country all his life beginning as a young Marine leading his platoon onto Blue Beach on Iwo Jima earning him a Purple Heart, followed by a job as a decoder at the State Department, Consulate General to Turkey stationed in Istanbul, then 40+ years with the CIA and the U.S. Ambassador to Madagascar, the Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kenya where he was beloved by President Kenyatta. Until his death, he remained a member of the prestigious Racquet & Tennis Club, The Brook, The Explorers' Club and was Founding Chairman of the Marine Corps University Foundation as well as a recipient of the General John H. Russell Leadership Award. Tony had the tenderest of hearts, a brilliant mind and an outrageous sense of humor. It was my honor to love and be loved so tenderly by Tony for more than 25 years.

Lippman was born in Brooklyn, eldest of three brothers. He graduated from City College of New York and Yale Law School. Most of his legal career was devoted to preventing the break-up of AT&T.

For about 30 years Lippman was a serious amateur Cantor for two different congregations, and widely known as a teacher of his own cantorial style, which incorporated classical historical cantorial literarure with other classical music which illustrated the liturgy.

2014-12-01T00:00:00Z,"STOECKLEIN--David R. 1949-2014. Legendary photographer David R. Stoecklein left his mark on our world in more ways than one. The son of Bernard and Dorothy and brother of Buzzy, Julie, Walter and Debbie Stoecklein, he was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1949. During his early twenties he headed west to pursue his passion for photography. David met Mary Jagger in 1976 and after moving to Sun Valley, Idaho, they married and were blessed with three boys-- Drew, Taylor and Colby. Everyone who knew David also understood that he was completely in love and devoted as a husband, a father and friend to all. David's images dominated the ski and outdoor industry, but his contribution to advertising made him one of the most sought after photographers in the business. He worked with Chevrolet and Jeep to Marlboro and Stetson, Canon USA and Epson, Coca Cola and Bayer to name a few. His passion was in documenting the cowboy way of life and the men and women who knew a thing or two about hard work and making an honest living. David lived by the code of the West. In fact he provided the photographs and publishing for the book Cowboy Ethics. His word was worth gold, and his handshake meant everything. He finished what he started, spoke his peace, but always listened first. He worked hard, played hard, and always made a stranger feel welcome. He was both tough and tender, and his life has inspired countless others. The iconic American Western photographer was much loved and admired for his gregarious character and passion for life. His photographs will forever be a tribute to his talents and his spirit will live on in all those whose lives he graced. He remains legendary. In his honor, Mary and her three sons have established the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation. It is a charitable organization designed to provide help to causes David cared so much for--such as providing scholarships to aspiring photography students and to helping cowboys and cowgirls in need. The Stoecklein family would like to continue David's legacy of education and generosity for generations to come. Memorial donations in memory of David may be made to the David R. Stoecklein Memorial and Educational Foundation in care of Attorney Brian Barsotti, P.O. Box 370, Ketchum, ID 83340.

Russell, 16th Commandant of the Marine Corps, Tony was first and always a Marine. Tony loved animals as much as people and was a talented wildlife photographer working for both for National Geographic magazine and World Books Encyclopedia in the 1950's and 1960's, an early conservationist, author of seven books and a highly respected three- time United States Ambassador. Tony very much loved his three stepchildren, Arden, Inness and Robert and three step-grandchildren James, Lyon and Weston who showered him with love, affection and respect particularly his stepson Robert with whom he formed an everlasting and most loving bond. During the course of his life, he helped countless young people get their own start in life by introducing them to those who could provide internships or jobs or sometimes he would write a check to tide one over until they could make it on their own. And then he relished in their success. Tony served his country all his life beginning as a young Marine leading his platoon onto Blue Beach on Iwo Jima earning him a Purple Heart, followed by a job as a decoder at the State Department, Consulate General to Turkey stationed in Istanbul, then 40+ years with the CIA and the U.S. Ambassador to Madagascar, the Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kenya where he was beloved by President Kenyatta. Until his death, he remained a member of the prestigious Racquet & Tennis Club, The Brook, The Explorers' Club and was Founding Chairman of the Marine Corps University Foundation as well as a recipient of the General John H. Russell Leadership Award. Tony had the tenderest of hearts, a brilliant mind and an outrageous sense of humor. It was my honor to love and be loved so tenderly by Tony for more than 25 years.

Irv served the hospital and health care administration field with a lifetime of extraordinary leadership, innovation and contributions delivered with a keen intelligence, sparkling humor, a genuine kindness and interest in every person he met. He possessed an ability to quickly envision essentials, foresee creative solutions and bring them into existence. With an acute perception of others' talents, he provided an incubator for great managers. A true gentleman, in his career and throughout his life this quality of kindness, care and respect for others was always present. He held senior executive management positions at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, New York University Medical Center, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York and Montefiore Medical Center during his 38 years in hospital and health care administration. While chief executive of University Hospital in New York, it evolved into a major teaching facility of New York University. Among countless contributions, he smoothly moved the Post Graduate Hospital into the new University Hospital building on First Avenue in 1963. He originated the Cooperative Care concept for inpatients, and built the first 100-bed facility in the nation. His emphasis on patient education and family involvement resulted in charges 40% below average, provided an element of care only a loved one can give, and strengthened family relationships. Its unqualified success received national and international acclaim and resulted in eighteen more Cooperative Care facilities across the country. Throughout his career he actively participated in local, state and national health associations and forums including the N.I.H. General Clinical Research Centers Committee, the Liaison Committee on Graduate Education (A.C.G.M.E.), and the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council. He was chairman of the Greater New York Hospital Association, the Hospital Association of New York State, and the Council of Teaching Hospitals of the AAMC and was a director of the New York Blood Center, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York and the American Hospital Association. Mr. Wilmot was a Life Fellow of The American College of Healthcare Executives and a Professor of Health Care Management at New York University. Born in Nanking China on June 30, 1922, and raised in California, he was the son of Dr. Frank A. Wilmot and Ethel Ranney Wilmot, missionaries who built the Drum Tower Hospital in China which still operates today. He served in the US Navy from 1940-1946 as an Aviation Chief Machinists Mate. A graduate of Northwestern University (1955) he held a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago (1957). Beloved and devoted husband and father he married his life's partner of 69 years Dorothy Agnes Wilmot on February 6, 1943. Residents of Rye, NY for 50 years, Irv and Dorothy (who passed in March 2012) were the love of each other's lives, true partners, devoted parents and keen world travelers. Irv was an avid golfer, and enjoyed some painting and sculpting in retirement years. A gifted architect, he created solutions for anything needed at home.

Irv served the hospital and health care administration field with a lifetime of extraordinary leadership, innovation and contributions delivered with a keen intelligence, sparkling humor, a genuine kindness and interest in every person he met. He possessed an ability to quickly envision essentials, foresee creative solutions and bring them into existence. With an acute perception of others talents, he provided an incubator for great managers. A true gentleman, in his career and throughout his life this quality of kindness, care and respect for others was always present. He held senior executive management positions at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, New York University Medical Center, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York and Montefiore Medical Center during his 38 years in hospital and health care administration. While chief executive of University Hospital in New York, it evolved into a major teaching facility of New York University. Among countless contributions, he smoothly moved the Post Graduate Hospital into the new University Hospital building on First Avenue in 1963. He originated the Cooperative Care concept for inpatients, and built the first 100-bed facility in the nation. His emphasis on patient education and family involvement resulted in charges 40% below average, provided an element of care only a loved one can give, and strengthened family relationships. Its unqualified success received national and international acclaim and resulted in eighteen more Cooperative Care facilities across the country. Throughout his career he actively participated in local, state and national health associations and forums including the N.I.H. General Clinical Research Centers Committee, the Liaison Committee on Graduate Education (A.C.G.M.E.), and the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council. He was chairman of the Greater New York Hospital Association, the Hospital Association of New York State, and the Council of Teaching Hospitals of the AAMC and was a director of the New York Blood Center, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York and the American Hospital Association. Mr. Wilmot was a Life Fellow of The American College of Healthcare Executives and a Professor of Health Care Management at New York University. Born in Nanking China on June 30, 1922, and raised in California, he was the son of Dr. Frank A. Wilmot and Ethel Ranney Wilmot, missionaries who built the Drum Tower Hospital in China which still operates today. He served in the US Navy from 1940-1946 as an Aviation Chief Machinists Mate. A graduate of Northwestern University (1955) he held a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago (1957). Beloved and devoted husband and father he married his life's partner of 69 years Dorothy Agnes Wilmot on February 6, 1943. Residents of Rye, NY for 50 years, Irv and Dorothy (who passed in March 2012) were the love of each other's lives, true partners, devoted parents and keen world travelers. Irv was an avid golfer, and enjoyed some painting and sculpting in retirement years. A gifted architect, he created solutions for anything needed at home. Together they raised two children who survive them: Marcia B. Wilmot of Port Washington, NY and David M. Wilmot of Las Vegas, NV. Also surviving are two nephews, Stephen Warshauer of Manning, SC and Michael Warshauer of Bend, OR. The family will receive friends at the Graham Funeral Home, 1036 Boston Post Road, Rye, NY 10580, on Saturday December 6, 2014 from 9am to 12:30pm.

2014-12-07T00:00:00Z,"RITTER--Patricia Kingsley, 84, a pioneer civil and human rights leader and educator, died of acute leukemia on December 10, 2004, in Hartford, CT. She was a woman of uncommon grace and quiet intensity with a lifelong commitment to social justice. As a 16-year-old freshman at the University of Iowa, she organized a sit-in at a segregated restaurant and headed south to become an early freedom rider. In post-war 1947, she assisted Margaret Mead at the first Salzburg Seminar in American Studies. In 1950, she was the first woman appointed to the Connecticut Civil Rights Commission. In the early 1960's, she co-founded with her husband, George, and headed a national model for integrated, affordable housing, still going strong. With heart and innovation, she championed integrated housing as board chair of the Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust in New York City in the 1970's, and as an appointee of President Carter's to the National Housing Partnership board in the 1980's. Among the first foreign teachers invited to China at the close of the Cultural Revolution, she taught English at universities there for years, established several libraries, and created a foundation that forged an early educational link with the country. She taught English, humanities and sociology at various U.S. schools, including the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, CT, where she pioneered women's studies in high school. Ms. Ritter studied education (M.A.) and philosophy and ethics at Yale. One of her honorary degrees--from Heilongjiang University in Harbin, China, where she taught--was bestowed at her lecture on Harriet Beecher Stowe from an outdoor balcony before a throng of admirers. She was a direct descendant of Pastor John Robinson, who coordinated his congregation's migration from Holland on the Mayflower. For 58 years she was married to George Ritter, an attorney, entrepreneur, state legislator and fellow social activist. She was a passionate, wise and devoted presence for her children Martha, Scott, Thomas, Penn and John, and their families. See courant.com/obituaries.

Siragusa (founder, Admiral Corporation) and late Irene O'Brien Siragusa; beloved husband of Alison Siragusa for 62 years; devoted father of Irene S. Phelps (Charles J. Eastman), Alisa S. Perrotte and Ross D. Siragusa III (Susan K. Siragusa); cherished grandfather of Andrew A. Perrotte, Isabel K. Siragusa and J. Marco Siragusa; and dear brother of John R. Siragusa (Jack), Richard D. Siragusa (Dick) and Mary Irene Siragusa Hicks (deceased). Ross grew up in Barrington, IL and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, MA in 1949 and Yale University in 1953. He married Alison F. Fennelly in June 1952 and they raised their three children in Lake Forest, IL. Ross joined his father's television company Admiral Corporation in 1953, holding several executive positions over the years. He succeeded his father as president from 1969 to 1974, when Admiral was acquired by Rockwell International. He was elected to the Board of Directors and served until 1995. In 1976, Ross and his brothers Jack and Dick bought Game Time, a manufacturer of commercial outdoor playground equipment and in 1981 they moved the company to Fort Payne, Alabama. Ross served as president until his retirement in 1997, when Game Time was acquired by Swing-N- Slide Corp. In 1981 Ross and Alison moved to Fort Payne, AL and established Straight Creek Farm, a successful 500 acre cow/calf operation with Limousine cattle. He grew up on a farm and always wanted to live on one again. Like his father before him, Ross was an astute businessman, a thoughtful problem solver and an innovator. He held several patents for equipment, and inspired those around him with his deep curiosity and passion for education and life-long learning. A modest man who preferred to work quietly behind the scenes, Ross leaves a remarkable philanthropic legacy though his personal giving to educational institutions, nonprofits serving youth and advancing educational opportunities, as well as through his father's charitable entity The Siragusa Foundation, on which he served as board member from 1980-1981 and 1991-2007. He was instrumental in leading the foundation to make the largest grant in its history --$6 million to Lurie Childrens Hospital, saying that the transplant program at Lurie was cutting edge, much like the work of his father and Admiral Television. Ross was a major benefactor of the Yale University Art Gallery and along with Alison a loyal member of its Patrons group for many years. Ross and Alison had a passion for traveling. Together, they visited all seven continents and encouraged their children and grandchildren to see the world. He was a gourmet cook and enjoyed sharing new recipes with family and friends. Colleagues, friends and family remember Ross as generous and caring in all his endeavors, a gracious host, an engaging conversationalist, and a gentleman of great integrity with a wonderful sense of humor. He valued people and his family above all else. Ross has passed on a steadfast legacy and will be dearly missed. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to The Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel St, New Haven, CT 06510.

Gifted with beauty, a philosophical cast of mind, mischievous humor, a vast talent for languages, music, and art, Nina had boundless energy, courage, good judgment, and a fierce intelligence that helped her survive the trauma of World War II, the rigors of post-war displacement to Italy, and eventual resettlement in the United States. Adaptable and inventive, she excelled in every profession in which she worked: as interpreter/secretary for the British Red Cross and the Allied Military Government for Occupied Forces in the aftermath of WW II; radio broadcaster in Trieste; EKG technician in Chicago; in various areas of library science at the libraries of Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology; University of Illinois; and, until her retirement in 1989, as Slavic and East European Bibliographer, Columbia University. She had studied Slavic philology at the University of Ljubljana, where she met her future husband, Dr. Rado L. Lencek (1921-2005), Professor Emeritus of Slavic Languages and Cultures, Columbia University. They married in Gorizia, Italy, in May 1946. Her account of the Allies' forced repatriation of thousands of captured anti-Communist Yugoslavs and Russians in the spring 1945 -among them members of her own family - was included in the historian Nikolai Tolstoy's expose of the ensuing atrocities and in the BBC documentary ""A British Betrayal."" Moving easily among six languages, she peppered her speech with citations from Greek and Latin writers; was a discriminating reader; and, in the last years of her life, relished drawing the Tuscan countryside. An inspired cook, she was celebrated for producing the Platonic ideal of apple strudel. Her memory is lovingly honored by her daughters Bibi and Lena; grandchildren Bianca Lencek Bosker (Nguyen), Misko and Katrina Lencek-Inagaki, relatives, friends, and colleagues. She lived the motto: ""Quidquid agis, prudenter agas et respice finem!"" and exhorted us to love as fully and as well as we can. She will be buried in Ljubljana in May 2015. A celebration of her life is scheduled for January 22, 2015 in Butler Library, Columbia University. 1/3"

2014-12-07T00:00:00Z,"BRY--Doris, leading authority on the works of Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe, passed away at her home in New York on December 3rd, just two days before her 94th birthday. During her long life she worked for Time-Life as a science researcher, established her own publishing imprint, Atlantis Editions, and acted as agent for Georgia O'Keeffe. She was intensely interested in photography and the challenges of reproducing it in ink. Publications with which she was involved are noted for their high level of visual quality. Bry collaborated with Nicholas Callaway on a three-volume set of Georgia O'Keeffe's paintings and was currently working with Thomas Palmer on what was to be the final work on her experiences with O'Keeffe in New Mexico. Bry wrote the exhibition catalogue for ""Alfred Stieglitz"" at the National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC, 1958) and authored the monograph, ""Alfred Stieglitz: Photographer"" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1965). She published ""Georgia O'Keeffe: Some Memories of Drawings,"" a study of O'Keeffe drawings, in 1988 (Atlantis Editions). A dignified and intensely private person who often worked alone, in 2008 Bry was honored at a symposium at Yale University with the publication of a student- curated exhibition entitled ""From Any Angle: Photographs from the Collection of Doris Bry"" -she greatly enjoyed her interactions with the students. Her many accomplishments included organizing, along with O'Keeffe, the estate of Alfred Stieglitz. Together they arranged for many institutions across the United States to receive gifts from Stieglitz's private collection of works by John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Arthur Dove, Charles Demuth and Georgia OKeeffe. Along with Lloyd Goodrich, Bry helped curate the major 1970 O'Keeffe exhibition at the Whitney Museum of Art, The Art Institute of Chicago and the San Francisco Museum of Art. For decades, while acting as O'Keeffe's exclusive agent, auction houses, art dealers, curators and collectors relied on her expertise, generously and freely given, to authenticate and properly catalogue works by O'Keeffe that entered the marketplace. As the price of works escalated, authenticity issues arose and Bry was asked to help on more and more occasions. Doris Bry influenced at least two decades of scholars, curators, dealers and collectors in the field of photography. She worked with the finest museums in the country, helping to build their photography collections with her early pioneering efforts in that field; she had a particularly rich relationship with the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas. Doris Bry is survived by her sister, Marcia Kaplan, of Chevy Chase, MD. 1/3"

It was a fitting end to a life well lived. Felix started as a surgical resident at Maimonides after service as a Captain in WWII. At a time when surgical specialization was uncommon, he helped create and advance the field of vascular surgery. His affiliation with Maimonides lasted nearly 70 years. A natural teacher, he adored working with residents at Maimonides Medical Center, Downstate Hospital, and Kings County Hospital, where he helped them explore the science and the art of medicine. Until a few weeks ago, he still regularly attended 7am teaching conferences. His colleagues there were his second family. At home, Felix was a voracious reader, an enthusiastic cyclist and swimmer, and a discerning eater. He, and his wife Judith --an actress, poet, teacher, classical music scholar, and gourmet cook, who died last year --are survived by Felix's sister, loving children, grandchildren, a great-grandchild, and friends, who miss his brilliance, humor, insight, and, most of all, his humanity.

2014-12-10T00:00:00Z,"BRODEUR--Lester. Lester Brodeur, age 75 of Rockwall, TX, passed away December 5, 2014. He was born January 28, 1939, in Brooklyn, NY, to Lester and Kathleen (Dockerty) Bullene. Born to poverty, Lester was the oldest of six children and soon became the breadwinner for his younger brothers, sisters and mother. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1956 and after his discharge in 1959 attended college at night, after work. Lester earned two bachelors degrees on the GI Bill from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, one in Mathematics and the other in Aerospace Engineering. From there, he pursued his passion in electronics and computers and soon became a renowned inventor. Lester possessed a genius level IQ and was gifted in aerospace, computer technology, guidance systems, micro-chip engineering, medical inventions and applied science. Among his more famous inventions are the final stages of the MRI, the fetal heart monitor, the microprocessor-controlled LORAN C (precursor to GPS), the electrical waveform generator, many military jet counter-measure systems, the Air Force One guidance system and NASAs Space Shuttle guidance system. He held 35 U.S. patents and dozens of foreign patents. In 1976, at the young age of 37, Lester was nominated by his peers for the Nobel Prize in Science. A hard worker and creative inventor, he rose to the prestigious positions of Chief Scientist of Lockheed Martin Corporation and Principal Senior Engineer of BAE Systems. According to his fellow engineers, though, Lesters greatest gift was his friendly and down to earth manner. He was a dedicated husband and father, an avid sailor and pilot, and a man who loved life. Lester is survived by his wife of 56 years: Kate Brodeur of Rockwall, TX; sons: Mark Brodeur of Rockwall, TX, and David Brodeur of Eliot, ME; daughter: Jennifer Pachico of Hudson, NH; brothers: James Wallace Brodeur and Robert Brodeur, both of Medford, OR, and Donald Brodeur of St. Pete Beach, FL; sisters: Cathleen Cudd of Walnut Creek, CA, and Michelle Latourette of Mesa, AZ; ten grandchildren and one great grandchild.

2014-12-11T00:00:00Z,"LIEBOWITZ--Murray, of Boca Raton, Florida and South Egremont, Massachusetts, died at home surrounded by family on Monday, December 1st, 2014. He was 86. Mr. Liebowitz was born in Manhattan on September 4th, 1928 to Lena and Henry Liebowitz. His father ran a hotel in the Catskills, The Pine Grove Hotel in Loch Sheldrake, New York, and Murray spent many summers helping him do so. His business acumen came naturally and he had great successes in his career through a variety of activities ranging from selling eggs (Jersey June Eggs) to commercial real estate (MSL Management) to trading on the stock market. (He always said the best eggs to buy were large and brown -never white or extra large.) Murray and his wife Patti (1934-2013) had an appreciation for good food and memorable parties. Together, they dined in restaurants throughout Europe and ate meals prepared in their homes by world-renowned chefs and Murray was a certified member of the food and wine society called the Chaine des Rotisseurs. The parties they hosted on many special occasions--at Blantyre in Lenox, Massachusetts, and at their homes in the Berkshires and south Florida--were always memorable. Their New Year's Eve parties, with the best champagne from Murray's extensive cellar and caviar from Zabar's, annually kicked off the years in style for their family and friends. But they also sat down every night at 6:30, with each other and often other family members, to a home-made meal in their kitchen that followed the ""rules of the Chaine"" on a properly set table. Murray was proud of his Jewish heritage and embraced its tradition of philanthropy throughout his life. Patti and he supported many worthy causes, including American Friends of Torah B'Yisrael -affiliated with a New Jersey synagogue that educated his children when he was just starting out, the Anti-Defamation League, and Women in Distress of Broward County. He was deeply committed to the value of higher education, and his greatest support was devoted to his daughter Suzanne's alma mater, Simon's Rock College of Bard in the Berkshires, where he served for thirty years, first as a member and then as vice-president of the Board of Overseers; and to Bard College in New York, where he was a member of the Board of Trustees for more than twenty years. His many gifts to Simon's Rock provided essential support to its annual fund, scholarship, endowment, and building projects-- including the construction of the Liebowitz Arts and Humanities Center and the Liebowitz Center for International Studies, establishment of the Murray Liebowitz and the Lena Liebowitz Scholarships. His support of Bard College and the initiatives of its president, Leon Botstein, were also extensive. Murray developed and nurtured numerous friendships throughout his life -many lasting a lifetime. Their support and love for Murray enriched his life immensely, just as his life has enriched theirs. He leaves them behind along with a family that loves him. He is survived by his children, Howard Liebowitz, Sheldon Liebowitz, Susan Rindner, Suzanne Klimek and Pamela Palumbo; and his grandchildren Bryan, Justin and Lauren Rindner; Nicole Liebowitz; and Zachary and Michael Palumbo. Arrangements for a spring memorial are pending. Mourners may honor his memory through an act of philanthropy to any of the organizations listed above or one of their choosing. 1/3"

2014-12-11T00:00:00Z,"HARTWELL--Anne V.,died on December 9 at home in Framingham, MA of pancreatic cancer discovered only three weeks earlier. We who are writing this, her children and husband of 59 years, can only say she was, quite simply, the light of our lives. She was loving, caring and funny in about equal proportions. She also set an example for us by her own accomplishments in the fields of politics and work for disadvantaged persons. Being the daughter of a Rhode Island governor, William H. Vanderbilt, her first love was politics. She worked in the campaigns of John F. Kennedy (president 1960); Robert Kennedy (New York Senate 1964); Adlai Stevenson III (U.S.Senate 1970); Dan Walker (Illinois Governor 1972); Ruth Messinger (Manhattan Borough President 1989); and Paul Tsongas (president 1992). Her interest in helping the disadvantaged was focused on low income housing in New York City. From the early 1970's to the 1990's, she held senior volunteer positions with Mobilization for Youth Legal Services (tenant management); Association for Neighborhood Housing Development (tenant co-ops for purchasing fuel, insurance, etc.); and Bronx Heights Neighborhood Community Corporation (housing related community organizing). Upon moving to Boston in the early 1990's, she became a volunteer with Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative located south of the city. At other times, she was a participant in the founding of radio station WMCA's Call For Action in New York; Chicago Journalism Review; New York based Women's World Banking; and The New York Women's Foundation. Board memberships included Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, Citizens Committee for New York, and Adlai Stevenson Institute. Her enjoyment of skiing and mountain trekking caused all of us to take up these sports and make them the center of family vacations. Anne is survived by three daughters, Ellen Blais, Charlotte Gesten, and Anne MacNair; a son, Samuel Hartwell, Jr.; eight grandchildren; and her husband, Samuel Hartwell, Sr. Among her parting words she said that misbehavior by any of us would result in corrective visitations by her from above.

2014-12-16T00:00:00Z,"HALMAN--Talat Sait. Talat Sait Halman, 83, Bilkent (Ankara), Turkey, and New York City, died from a heart attack at Bilkent University on December 5. Halman was born in Istanbul in 1931 in the first decade of Ataturk's Republic. He studied at the country's leading institution, the American Robert College of Istanbul. In 1952 he came to New York for graduate studies at Columbia University. A year and a half later he was hired to teach Turkish there. While a graduate student he worked as a clerk at the Record Hunter, New York's famed classical music store; a year later he became the general manager when the owner died suddenly, and he brought the company out of bankruptcy within three years. After graduate studies, Halman stayed in the United States for the next four decades and had a distinguished career at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University, where he served as chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures. He returned briefly to Turkey to serve as his country's first Minister of Culture (1971); in the 1980s he served as Turkey's first and only Ambassador for Cultural Affairs, stationed in New York. At this time he also served as Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Halman was appointed as a delegate to UNESCO in 1989 and later was elected to the Executive Board and served with distinction as president of its primary commission, Programme and External Relations; since 2003 he served as president of the Turkish National Committee for UNICEF. Among myriad awards, Halman received the Knight Grand Cross, G.B.E, from Queen Elizabeth during her 1971 state visit to Turkey. After 45 years in the United States, Halman joined Bilkent in 1996 as founding chairman of the university's Department of Turkish Literature and most recently had also been serving as Dean of Humanities and Letters. It was Halman's humanism and cross-cultural approach that is his most lasting legacy. In 1976 he arranged a Middle Eastern Literature symposium that took place both at the New York Public Research Library and Princeton University. It was the first such conference that included both Israeli and Arab writers. He opened the way for the teaching of Turkish literature and culture at major universities in the U.S. Before that, Middle Eastern studies departments concentrated primarily on Arab and Persian studies. Halman published nearly 3,000 articles, essays, newspaper columns, and reviews in English and in Turkish. He translated over 10,000 poems from English into Turkish and Turkish into English, and wrote over 80 books, including 11 volumes of his own poetry. He was William Faulkner's first Turkish translator. This publication of ""Knight's Gambit"" had a tremendous impact on the nascent short-story and novel genres in the Turkish Republic. For his work as a translator he won Columbia University's Thornton Wilder Prize. Among his books in Turkish are a massive volume of the poetry of ancient civilizations, the poetry of ancient Anatolia and the Near East, Eskimo poems, ancient Egyptian poetry, the rubais of Rumi, the quatrains of Baba Tahir Uryan, several collections of Yunus Emre poetry, two anthologies of modern American poetry, and books of selected poems of Wallace Stevens and Langston Hughes. He also translated works by Mark Twain and Eugene O'Neill. Translations of Shakespeare's ""Complete Sonnets"" count among his major achievements and have been published in many editions. This was the first time that the sonnets had been translated into Turkish using meter and rhyme. Earlier this year his translations of Shakespeare's long narrative poems, again into meter and rhyme, were published in Istanbul. Halman also wrote an original play about Shakespeare, his plays, and Turkish productions; the play was produced to the acclamation of Turkish theater audiences. Halman saw culture as a ""unifying force; when a nation develops itself culturally, humanism begins,"" he always said. It is Turkey's cultural plurality, the recognition of the inherent power of the cultural synthesis that the Turkish nation has fostered over the past fifteen centuries, combined with the numerous and diverse civilizations in the area that is now Turkey, that Halman sought to encourage and promote. The world's literary and cultural stage has lost a truly unique and irreplaceable talent--poet, translator, columnist, belletrist, accomplished academic, diplomat, charismatic public speaker, social and cultural critic, writers' activist, and much more. All of these contributions plus his willingness to share his wisdom and knowledge will be remembered by the countless audiences he enlightened, the numerous students he inspired and encouraged, and future generations who will benefit from this legacy. Talat Halman is survived by his wife Seniha, daughter Defne, son Hur (from a former marriage), and grandchildren Melissa, William, and Olivia. His son Sait predeceased him in 1983. Jayne L.

2014-12-16T00:00:00Z,"CRABTREE--Richard Clarke. Richard ""Dick"" Clarke Crabtree, died peacefully on December 12 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx with his family by his side. Dick was born in New Rochelle, NY and was raised there by his parents Joseph and Irene. He attended Iona Prep where he excelled in sports, especially track, setting multiple records including in the 440 yard and 220 yard dashes which stood for many decades. He attended both Notre Dame and Georgetown Universities where he studied business, and in 1952 he married Marjorie (Mimi) Hannon, a model, his childhood sweetheart, and dedicated wife until his death. Dick served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1953 to 1954 before entering the family automobile business, Crabtree Motors, where he took charge of the used car division and introduced the concept of 'certified pre- owned vehicles.' Dick was hired by Ford Motor Company as Northeast Manager of Edsel Car Dealership Sales, and despite the short term of the project, was proud that each of the dealerships that he established survived the Edsel debacle to become thriving businesses. Dick worked as a bank executive at both Citibank and Marine Midland Bank, but eventually realized his true calling was to utilize his prolific people skills in the restaurant business. He opened his first restaurant, Crabtree's Plaza Inn in Crestwood, NY in 1974 to great critical acclaim, and then in 1981 he purchased a popular landmark in Chappaqua, NY, the Kittle House, and completely restored the building and the business as the preeminent Restaurant and Inn in Westchester County. Amongst his numerous community positions, Dick served as a Commissioner of the Westchester County Police Board, 1978-1986, as Chairman of the Business School Advisory Board at Westchester Community College, as Trustee of the New Castle Historical Society, as president of Chappaqua Rotary, as a Director of Westchester/Putnam Girl Scouts of America, as president of the Boys and Girls Club, Myrtle Beach, and as Prior to the Sovereign Military Order of the Knights Templar. Dick also served in the New York Guard from 1992 until he retired in 1999 as a Brigadier General. In 1984 Dick received the Westchester County Distinguished Service Award. Dick will be greatly missed by the multitudes whose lives he touched. No matter how many hats he wore, and uniforms he donned, Dick never lost his energy for life and compassion for the people around him, and wherever he walked, the world was at least a little bit brighter. He will be forever remembered as a man 'larger than life' with a charm, wit, humor, and compassion that were truly remarkable. He is predeceased by his brother Robert and sister Joan Mackin.

Mother-in-law to Jay Teitler, Robert Cohen and Wendy Lewis; adored grandmother to Amanda, Joshua, Kara, Marisa, Sophia, AJ, Vanessa and Adam. Her intelligence, beauty and competence were upstaged only by her capacity to love. Among her great passions were her family, the Democratic Party, culture and any creature in trouble. She came to local media attention at 88 when a pit bull killed her beloved dog Rosie and she called every outlet to warn pet owners beware. Beyond being an active doctor's wife and raising five children, her prodigious energy led to work, subsequently, as HS teacher, dance instructor and long time docent at the Brooklyn Museum where her fluency ranged from Bernini to Basquiat. Great art brought sublime pleasure and more than once her children found her weeping over a libretto while Tosca, Aida or Tannhauser blared from the sound system. The family will deeply miss her and strive to live out her great spirit. There will be a private service. 1/3"

The Board of Directors, officers and staff of Astoria Financial Corporation and Astoria Bank extend our deepest sympathies on the passing of our distinguished former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer George L. Engelke, Jr. For 40 years, George was an extraordinary business leader and beloved member of the Astoria family. His vision made it possible to grow from a mutually owned thrift into a premier community bank on Long Island, with a reputation for extensive community involvement. George's vision for building a better bank was evident as he converted the bank to public ownership in 1993, and then acquired Fidelity New York Savings Bank, Greater New York Savings Bank and Long Island Savings Bank, building a retail banking franchise which would serve the banking needs of a region with a population greater than that of 38 states. George's business acumen was invaluable to the bank's growth and expansion, and his kindness toward all those he met was inspirational. A hard-working executive and Certified Public Accountant by trade, he believed in the value of education. His professional skills were matched only by his larger than life personality, and genuine interest in the welfare of the bank's customers and staff. An advocate for affordable housing, homeownership and community revitalization, George was a former Chairman of The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and a member of the Board of Directors of the Community Preservation Corporation, as well as Chairman of the Savings Bank Association of New York State. He was also a former member of the Board of Directors of the New York Bankers Association and served as a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council. He was an active member of the Board of Trustees of Long Island University and the Advisory Board of Directors of Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, Inc.

2014-12-18T00:00:00Z,"BRIDWELL--Norman. Died December 12, 2014, on Marthas Vineyard at the age of 86. Norman is mourned by all of his friends at Scholastic, the global publishing, education and media company, where his beloved children's series, Clifford the Big Red Dog, has been nurtured and published for more than fifty years. Bridwell created the character of Clifford in 1963 and went on to write and illustrate more than 150 titles in the series, which now boasts 129 million books in print in 13 languages. In 2000, everyone's favorite BIG red dog made his television debut on PBS Kids and the animated series quickly became one of the network's biggest children's hits. Norman Bridwell's books about Clifford, childhood's most loveable dog, could only have been written by a gentle man with a great sense of humor. Norman personified the values that parents and educators hope to communicate to children kindness, compassion, helpfulness, gratitude through the Clifford stories which have been loved for more than fifty years. The magic of the character and stories Norman created with Clifford is that children can see themselves in this big dog who tries very hard to be good, but is somewhat clumsy and always bumping into things and making mistakes. What comforts the reader is that Clifford is always forgiven by Emily Elizabeth, who loves him unconditionally. At Scholastic, we are deeply saddened by the loss of our loyal and talented friend whose drawings and stories have inspired all of us and generations of children and their parents. We offer our condolences to Normans wife of 56 years, Norma Bridwell, their daughter Emily, their son Timothy and their three grandchildren. Richard Robinson Chairman, President, CEO, Scholastic"

Rabbi will be missed by many; none more so than the Righteous Gentiles whose deeds during the Holocaust he championed for years. Establishing The Jewish Foundation for the Righteous brought attention to the bravery of non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Rabbi Schulweis was a man of faith, spirituality, compassion, principle, and action. He cared deeply about others and worked his entire life to make our world a much better place. Whether it was from the pulpit or whether it was through his writings, Rabbi Schulweis motivated others to action in an effort to repair our broken world.

2014-12-19T00:00:00Z,"PARSON--Donna Fox, 73, died on December 16 of complications from heart surgery. Donna was born in 1941 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and died in New York City. Donna was a remarkable and multifaceted woman whose life and work touched thousands of people. As a community organizer in Connecticut, she led the fight to stop Interstate 84 from slicing through wetlands and historic sites. She served as Executive Director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group and of Northeast Action, a regional support center for organizing. Donna also directed two Congressional campaigns and numerous state legislative campaigns, and worked in the Connecticut Secretary of the State's office under Secretary of the State Miles Rapoport. Later, her activist work took her to New York and Washington, where she served in key positions at Public Campaign, Demos, and most recently Common Cause. Through all of this, Donna was a mentor and friend to hundreds of young organizers, especially women, in their careers and personal lives. Donna was also a traveler and a writer. She recently completed a novel about two sisters in Estonia, separated by war, and the lives they led, told in the letters they exchanged. The inspiration for the book was the Estonian heritage of her husband of 29 years, John Parson, who predeceased her in 1997. John and Donna shared a beautiful, extraordinary, and unshakeable bond. They loved, they traveled, they shared everything, and they raised two wonderful and accomplished daughters, Jennifer Parson of San Francisco and Joanna Parson of New York City. Donna is also survived by her siblings Gayle, Roger, and Michael Fox, all of Michigan. No funeral services are planned. A memorial service will be held at a future date.

2014-12-19T00:00:00Z,"GUIHER--James M.,Jr., died on December 17 in Columbia, Maryland. Beloved husband of Elizabeth ""Liddy"" Hart Guiher and father of Catharine Brownfield Guiher and Deborah Guiher Chamblee. The only child of Ruth Souders and James M. Guiher, Sr., he was born in Clarksburg, WV, on February 21, 1927. He was raised in Clarksburg and graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1945. After military service as Private First Class in the army in post-WWII occupied Germany, he attended Princeton University on the GI bill, class of 1951. He attended Harvard Law School, but did not finish, opting instead to get an MFA degree from the Museum School of Fine Arts in Boston in 1954. He married Liddy in 1954 and they settled in New York City. Jim worked for Prentice-Hall publishing company, where he rose to be the sponsoring editor for art and geology books. His crowning achievement there was publishing the textbook edition of H.W. Janson's ""History of Art."" Later, he became editor-in-chief of the elementary and high school textbooks division. He retired from publishing in 1976 to pursue a writing career and intellectual pursuits. Valuing the wisdom of Greek pagan culture, he wrote two Greek-themed plays, ""Aphrodite"" and ""Candoo!"", which he self-published in 2010. In later life, he had become increasingly concerned about political discord and religious intolerance, both in the United States and around the world, and felt that the Greek philosophy of ""everything in moderation, nothing to excess"" held the key to the world's problems. Jim devoted great efforts to preserving family history and artifacts. He ensured that the avant- garde films of Liddy's uncle, Jim Davis, were housed at Anthology Film Archives, curated by Robert Haller, and that numerous family historical documents were housed at the West Virginia and Regional History Center at the University of West Virginia, curated by John Cuthbert. After living in NYC for 60 years, he moved to Maryland in October 2014 to Charlestown retirement community, where his daughter Deborah works. He was looking forward to a new chapter of his life, and to continue working on disseminating his wisdom and insights through his writings, but increasingly nagging health issues resulted in his time being cut short. His parting wish for humanity is for people around the world to follow a path of moderation rather than fanaticism. He was pre-deceased by his wife, Liddy, in 2011. He is survived by his two daughters, Catharine (Brooklyn, NY) and Deborah (Columbia, MD), his son-in-law Jeff Chamblee, and two grandchildren, Rebecca Guiher Chamblee and Benjamin Guiher Chamblee. The funeral will be held at the Davis Funeral Home in Clarksburg, WV on Saturday January 3 at 11:00am. A memorial will be held in New York City at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, New York, NY 10003; or the West Virginia and Regional History Center, c/o WVU Foundation (IMO Jim Guiher FUND 2U139), PO Box 1650 -Morgantown, WV 26507-1650. 1/3"

Norman is mourned by all of his friends at Scholastic, the global publishing, education and media company, where his beloved children's series, Clifford the Big Red Dog, has been nurtured and published for more than fifty years. Bridwell created the character of Clifford in 1963 and went on to write and illustrate more than 150 titles in the series, which now boasts 129 million books in print in 13 languages. In 2000, everyone's favorite BIG red dog made his television debut on PBS Kids and the animated series quickly became one of the network's biggest children's hits. Norman Bridwell's books about Clifford, childhood's most loveable dog, could only have been written by a gentle man with a great sense of humor. Norman personified the values that parents and educators hope to communicate to children kindness, compassion, helpfulness, gratitude through the Clifford stories which have been loved for more than fifty years. The magic of the character and stories Norman created with Clifford is that children can see themselves in this big dog who tries very hard to be good, but is somewhat clumsy and always bumping into things and making mistakes. What comforts the reader is that Clifford is always forgiven by Emily Elizabeth, who loves him unconditionally. At Scholastic, we are deeply saddened by the loss of our loyal and talented friend whose drawings and stories have inspired all of us and generations of children and their parents. We offer our condolences to Normans wife of 56 years, Norma Bridwell, their daughter Emily, their son Timothy and their three grandchildren. Richard Robinson Chairman, President, CEO, Scholastic"

He cherished those experiences and the lifelong friendships that were made along the way. In addition to being an active member of the New York and Martinsville, NJ communities for close to 40 years, he was also a passionate and generous contributor to many educational institutions as well as charities devoted to animal rights -dogs in particular.

2014-12-21T00:00:00Z,"HALMAN--Talat Sait. Talat Sait Halman, 83, Bilkent (Ankara), Turkey, and New York City, died from a heart attack at Bilkent University on December 5. Halman was born in Istanbul in 1931 in the first decade of Ataturk's Republic. He studied at the country's leading institution, the American Robert College of Istanbul. In 1952 he came to New York for graduate studies at Columbia University. A year and a half later he was hired to teach Turkish there. While a graduate student he worked as a clerk at the Record Hunter, New York's famed classical music store; a year later he became the general manager when the owner died suddenly, and he brought the company out of bankruptcy within three years. After graduate studies, Halman stayed in the United States for the next four decades and had a distinguished career at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University, where he served as chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures. He returned briefly to Turkey to serve as his country's first Minister of Culture (1971); in the 1980s he served as Turkey's first and only Ambassador for Cultural Affairs, stationed in New York. At this time he also served as Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Halman was appointed as a delegate to UNESCO in 1989 and later was elected to the Executive Board and served with distinction as president of its primary commission, Programme and External Relations; since 2003 he served as president of the Turkish National Committee for UNICEF. Among myriad awards, Halman received the Knight Grand Cross, G.B.E, from Queen Elizabeth during her 1971 state visit to Turkey. After 45 years in the United States, Halman joined Bilkent in 1996 as founding chairman of the university's Department of Turkish Literature and most recently had also been serving as Dean of Humanities and Letters. It was Halman's humanism and cross-cultural approach that is his most lasting legacy. In 1976 he arranged a Middle Eastern Literature symposium that took place both at the New York Public Research Library and Princeton University. It was the first such conference that included both Israeli and Arab writers. He opened the way for the teaching of Turkish literature and culture at major universities in the U.S. Before that, Middle Eastern studies departments concentrated primarily on Arab and Persian studies. Halman published nearly 3,000 articles, essays, newspaper columns, and reviews in English and in Turkish. He translated over 10,000 poems from English into Turkish and Turkish into English, and wrote over 80 books, including 11 volumes of his own poetry. He was William Faulkner's first Turkish translator. This publication of ""Knight's Gambit"" had a tremendous impact on the nascent short-story and novel genres in the Turkish Republic. For his work as a translator he won Columbia University's Thornton Wilder Prize. Among his books in Turkish are a massive volume of the poetry of ancient civilizations, the poetry of ancient Anatolia and the Near East, Eskimo poems, ancient Egyptian poetry, the rubais of Rumi, the quatrains of Baba Tahir Uryan, several collections of Yunus Emre poetry, two anthologies of modern American poetry, and books of selected poems of Wallace Stevens and Langston Hughes. He also translated works by Mark Twain and Eugene O'Neill. Translations of Shakespeare's ""Complete Sonnets"" count among his major achievements and have been published in many editions. This was the first time that the sonnets had been translated into Turkish using meter and rhyme. Earlier this year his translations of Shakespeare's long narrative poems, again into meter and rhyme, were published in Istanbul. Halman also wrote an original play about Shakespeare, his plays, and Turkish productions; the play was produced to the acclamation of Turkish theater audiences. Halman saw culture as a ""unifying force; when a nation develops itself culturally, humanism begins,"" he always said. It is Turkey's cultural plurality, the recognition of the inherent power of the cultural synthesis that the Turkish nation has fostered over the past fifteen centuries, combined with the numerous and diverse civilizations in the area that is now Turkey, that Halman sought to encourage and promote. The world's literary and cultural stage has lost a truly unique and irreplaceable talent--poet, translator, columnist, belletrist, accomplished academic, diplomat, charismatic public speaker, social and cultural critic, writers' activist, and much more. All of these contributions plus his willingness to share his wisdom and knowledge will be remembered by the countless audiences he enlightened, the numerous students he inspired and encouraged, and future generations who will benefit from this legacy. Talat Halman is survived by his wife Seniha, daughter Defne, son Hur (from a former marriage), and grandchildren Melissa, William, and Olivia. His son Sait predeceased him in 1983. Jayne L.

It’s bad enough for tiny humans. For the proud young animals of the savanna, the concept of nap time is downright insulting. “Naps are for little babies,” according to a strapping crocodile; the giraffe declares herself “too tall,” the monkey “too busy.” De Moüy, who fills her bold, black-outlined gouache illustrations with great character, cleverly turns the tables on her readers, introducing a little girl — a former reluctant napper herself? — who outwits the beasts with the old “just close one eye” trick."
