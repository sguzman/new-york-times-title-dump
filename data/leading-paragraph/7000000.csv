Start with the shock upon arrival when the guy told you, “treinta” -- $30 -- to park on his lawn. When the stands shook and swayed, it registered on the Richter Scale. A big-play roar for the home team was like Niagara Falls from the Maid of the Mist. Homefield advantage? Huge. The Dolphins played there from 1966 to 1988, went unbeaten in 1972, and made it to four Super Bowls. None since. The University of Miami has won five National Championships since 1985, the most in college football.

Mr. Binney, above, can often be heard setting off depth charges in cozy settings like the 55 Bar, where his intensely cohesive groups enjoy a presiding eminence, for good reason. (See the ''gig download'' section of davidbinney.com.) Outside the New York nexus Mr. Binney's reputation is strong but a bit distorted; last year's Downbeat Critics Poll patronizingly designated him a ''rising star'' on his instrument, even though he's in his mid-40s, having lighted upon New York from Southern California more than 25 years ago. That honor would have been appropriate in the 1990s, when Mr. Binney was still establishing both his style and his footing. He started Mythology Records about a decade ago, and since then he has averaged an album a year, some on other independent labels. Last year he released not only ''Out of Airplanes'' (Mythology), featuring the guitarist Bill Frisell, but also ''Cities and Desire'' (Criss Cross) with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner. His only 2007 title is ''Océanos'' (Criss Cross), a collaboration with the pianist Edward Simon that's as notable for its compositions -- Mr. Binney contributed half of them -- as for its high standard of improvisation."

At the gathering, they called upon all contenders to succeed Mr. Wagner to prepare plans for the future of the annual event, devoted to the works of his grandfather Richard Wagner. Amid mounting pressure to step aside, Mr. Wagner, who has run the festival since 1966, was represented by his lawyer in what The Times called ''an often passionate and irritable debate'' over leadership of the festival, which has always been held by a member of the Wagner clan. Mr. Wagner, who has his job for life unless it can be established that he has lost his faculties, wants leadership to pass to Katharina Wagner, 29, his daughter from his second marriage. The other main contenders are relatives in their 60s: Eva Wagner-Pasquier, a daughter from his first marriage; and Nike Wagner, his niece and the daughter of Wieland Wagner, his brother, who died in 1966."

Ms. O'Donnell said as much in a posting to her Web site, rosie.com, earlier in the evening. The NBC executive, who would describe the negotiations only on condition of anonymity, said a principal hurdle had been the length of a potential contract. To preserve her options, Ms. O'Donnell would commit only to a year, the executive said. But the network wanted a deal for at least two years. A publicist for Ms. O'Donnell, Cindi Berger, did not dispute the NBC executive's assessment. ''Things do happen for a reason,'' she said yesterday. ''No harm, no foul. It didn't work out now.

Built in the Middle Ages, the city palace became the principal residence of the kings of Prussia in 1701. It was severely damaged by Allied bombs in 1945 and demolished in 1950 by the East German Communist authorities, who viewed it as a reminder of the imperial past and erected the Palace of the Republic in its place in the 1970s."

2007-11-09T00:00:00Z,"'BEYOND THE WALL: KIDS WITH CAMERAS -- JERUSALEM' In Israel, Jewish and Muslim children rarely see the world through one another's eyes. But not long ago, some did -- with the help of a camera's lens. The results are at the JCC in Manhattan, where ''Beyond the Wall'' illustrates the efforts of Jason Eskenazi, a New York photojournalist, to teach photography to children who were neighbors but seemed hopelessly divided by religion and politics. Mr. Eskenazi, with a grant from the nonprofit group Kids With Cameras, traveled to Jerusalem in 2004 with 24 point-and-shoot cameras. By distributing leaflets in the Muslim quarter, he recruited a dozen Muslims, all 8 to 12; a Jewish center helped find an equal number of Jews the same ages. Mr. Eskenazi met with each group separately. ''The goal was to make a portrait of Jerusalem,'' he said. But he also had a more difficult, and at first hidden, objective: someday to show each group the other's work."
2007-11-09T00:00:00Z,"WAELSCH--Salome G., Ph.D. Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University mourns the loss of our Distinguished University Professor Emerita of Molecular Genetics. World renowned for her contributions to the field of developmental genetics, and one of the pioneering woman scientists of the 20th century, Dr. Waelsch was a founding member of the Einstein faculty, joining the medical school when it opened in 1955. She was the leading force in the creation of our Department of Genetics, which she chaired from 1963 to 1976. Until she reached her mid-90s, she graced this campus with her presence, her scientific brilliance, and her lively interactions with faculty colleagues and students. Among her many accolades, she was awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor, in 1993, and was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1979. She was the recipient of the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal of the Genetics Society of America and received the first Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the American Cancer Society. She was an Honorary Life Member of The New York Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London. Dr. Waelsch's personal history has a special resonance for this College of Medicine, the first medical school established in the United States under Jewish auspices. She escaped from Nazi Germany in 1933. When invited back to her alma mater, the University of Freiburg, nearly 50 years later to receive an honorary degree for her scientific accomplishments, she refused to attend. Her refusal, she said in a letter to the University, was in honor of all of those who suffered under the Nazi regime, among them the man whose name our medical school carries with the greatest pride. We at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine are proud to have had Dr. Waelsch among us for nearly half a century. Her legacy of scientific accomplishment and moral imperative continues to inspire us, and she will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to her daughter, Naomi Kerest, her son, Peter, and her three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Allen M. Spiegel, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University"

2007-11-09T00:00:00Z,"'FOLKERT DE JONG: LES SALTIMBANQUES' Folkert de Jong is a young Dutch sculptor, though looking at his debut New York solo show at the James Cohan Gallery in Chelsea you would swear he was from Los Angeles. He makes life-size sculptural tableaus that bring to mind the grotesque masked figures inhabiting the Los Angeles stalwart Paul McCarthy's video performances, not to mention his use of icky, viscous industrial insulation materials like Styrofoam and polyurethane. Then there is the palette -- sky blue, bubble-gum pink, burning reds and a toxic green -- making the figures look like elaborately costumed visitors at a Halloween party, or melted department-store mannequins. His aesthetic roots also reach back into Modern European art, specifically Picasso's paintings of the Harlequin, an archetypal itinerant circus performer and lonely adventurer. For the youthful Picasso the Harlequin was a kind of alter ego, reflecting the alienation of an aspiring artist and foreigner living alone in Paris. Mr. de Jong's interest in the Harlequin feels more complicated than this, with him arranging groups of Harlequin figures in acrobatic formations (above, ''The Tower 'Violin Player''') or huddled about a fire in an oil drum. They are real people, if a little coldblooded. And they are also metaphors of a sort, pointing up the condition of the contemporary artist: a beggared fool performing for the wealthy.

2007-11-09T00:00:00Z,"A federal judge has ruled in favor of Penguin Putnam, a unit of Penguin Group, in a case in which it was accused of copyright infringement when it published ''Dorothy Parker, Complete Poems.'' In the case, Stuart Y. Silverstein, a Los Angeles lawyer who researched and assembled 122 previously uncollected poems and verses in the book ''Not Much Fun: The Lost Poems of Dorothy Parker,'' said Penguin had used his book as source material without crediting him. He argued that he was entitled to ''compilation copyright'' for the creativity he had showed by including or recategorizing some poems that other scholars had said were not proper poems, and by excluding others that scholars had said were Parker's work. Judge John F. Keenan, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who signed the most recent decision, ruled in 2003 that Penguin had infringed Mr. Silverstein's copyright and ordered the publisher to recall its books. Penguin appealed, and in May 2004 a federal appeals court concluded that Mr. Silverstein's copyright interest was slight and ordered the case to return to Federal District Court for a further ruling. On Wednesday Judge Keenan dismissed Mr. Silverstein's complaint, ruling that he did not demonstrate any creativity in selecting the poems that appeared in ''Not Much Fun.''"

2007-11-09T00:00:00Z,"NEW YORK COMEDY FESTIVAL Charlie Murphy's pursuit of a career in stand-up seems like the set-up for a joke his brother Eddie would have used in ''Raw'' -- one that would have begun with a description of a brother riding his coattails and ended in a perfectly timed, expletive-heavy punch line. Fortunately, Charlie Murphy, above, is well aware of the comedic possibilities of having a famous sibling. If his past shows are any indication, when he takes the stage at Caroline's during the final weekend of the New York Comedy Festival, his best bits will be self-deprecating ones in which names are dropped liberally. (In addition to his brother, he can always draw easy applause by mentioning ''Chappelle's Show,'' on which he also mined life in his brother's entourage for material.) And while his delivery doesn't have the punch of, say, a Chris Rock, his humor is serviceable enough to draw more than a few guilty laughs. Another festival performer for whom comedy is a family enterprise is Damon Wayans, who has shared a stage or a television show or a movie with several of his relatives. Mr. Wayans has gone from controversial on ''In Living Color'' to wholesome on ABC's ''My Wife and Kids,'' and back again. Which Mr. Wayans will show up at the Beacon Theater?

Bowlsby knows this, of course, because Palo Alto is the most expensive, with the average price of a 4-bedroom, 2,200 square-foot house being $1.67 million. This led to Stanford beginning an innovative new program where they actually buy houses for their football team coordinators to live in and give the assistant coaches a $3,000 per month housing stipend. That would buy a mansion in Muncie, Ind., the home of Ball State and the least expensive university town. A 4-bedroom house there costs an average of $150,000. The list was compiled by Coldwell Banker and is available to see here. Definitely some surprising numbers scattered throughout."

2007-11-11T00:00:00Z,"HILLMAN--Rita K., the noted philanthropist and art collector, died Thursday night, November 8th, at Lenox Hill Hospital, on the Upper East Side. She was 95 years old. She was born Rita Jean Kanarek on May 16, 1912, in New York City and attended New York University from 1929 to 1932, where she studied psychology. In 1932, she married the publisher Alex Lester Hillman, and together they began collecting art, focussing mainly on French Impressionism and Post-Impressionist art. Over the years, the Hillmans amassed a remarkable collection of nineteenthand twentieth-century European paintings, drawings, and sculptures. Among the artists represented in the Hillman Collection are Picasso, Matisse, Braque, Miro, Manet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Bonnard, Degas, Cezanne, Seurat, Soutine and Modigliani. In 1966, their son Richard died tragically in a road accident at the age of 28. Rita's husband, Alex, died in 1968. After his death, Rita became the President of the Alex Hillman Family Foundation, and, under her leadership, the foundation began to play a major role in supporting the arts in New York City. In 1974, she became a founding trustee of the International Center of Photography, and, over the course of more than three decades of involvement with ICP, she served as chairman of the Board and then honorary chairman. She also served as vice chairman of the Board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1982 to 1997 and was a member of the executive committee for more than thirty years. She was on the executive committee of the American Friends of the Israel Museum since its founding. In the late nineteeneighties, the city-and countrywide nursing shortage inspired her to shift the focus of the foundation to support nursing in New York City, with a special emphasis on bedside care, and to assist nursing students who couldn't afford tuition. In 1989, she established the Hillman/Penn Nursing Scholars Program at the University of Pennsylvania, which provides scholarships and postgraduate clinical mentoring opportunities to students committed to work for one year at a new York City hospital upon completion of their studies. In 1990, she partnered with Lenox Hill Hospital to found the Hillman Partners in Practice Program, and, in 1991, she established additional Hillman Scholar programs at the New York University Division of Nursing and the Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing. Since their inception, Hillman Nursing Scholar programs and scholarships have helped more than 1200 registered nurses. In 2004, Rita received the American Journal of Nursing - Beatrice Renfield Caring for the Caregiver Award. Rita is survived by her son, Alex HIllman, as well as her grandson, Ahrin Mishan, the son of the late Richard Hillman, as well as by her grandchildren Eva, Rebecca, Janice, and Richard. A funeral service will be held at 10:30am on Monday, November 12th at Frank E. Campbell's, Madison Avenue and 81st Street. Burial will be at the Kensico Cemetery, in Valhalla, NY. In lieu of flowersc ontributions in her memory can be made to the charity of your choice. HILLMAN--Rita K/d. Founding Trustee, Honorary Chairman, and generous benefactor of the International Center of Photography, Rita was much admired and loved by her fellow trustees and the ICP staff. We were honored to have had her friendship, counsel, and support since the earliest days of this institution, which she helped establish and whose educational work with young people gave her particular satisfaction. Our affection for her was accompanied by gratitude for her generosity and encouragement, unfailing wisdom, delightful sense of humor, and keen intelligence. She was a true New Yorker, a gracious presence and an indomitable spirit. Our profound condolences to the entire Hillman Family, the Hillman Foundation, and to the many who were touched by her. Gayle Greenhill, Chairman Jeffrey A. Rosen, President Cornell Capa, Founding Director Emeritus Willis E. Hartshorn, Ehrenkranz Director International Center of Photography HILLMAN--Rita/d. The Trustees Committee, faculty, students and staff of Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing join the entire Beth Israel Medical Center in acknowledging the passing of Rita Hillman, whose genuine interest and unwavering support enabled 253 men and women to pursue careers in nursing. The Hillman Scholars Program has helped the school to attract and educate the most qualified, motivated and caring students. Her love and passion for nursing and her indomitable spirit touched the life of each of her scholars. By helping them to become nurses, she has also had a tremendous impact on healthcare in New York City. We will be forever grateful for her dedication and generosity, and extend our heartfelt condolences to her wonderful family, kind assistant at the Foundation, and friends.

With profound sorrow, the entire Beth Israel Medical Center family mourns the passing of Rita Hillman, who dedicated herself to improving the quality of nursing care. Through the Hillman Family Foundation, Mrs. Hillman was a staunch supporter of Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing for 17 years. She funded numerous projects at the nursing school, most notably the Hillman Scholars Program, which offers full-tuition scholarships to the ''best and brightest'' individuals who demonstrate academic excellence and a commitment to compassionate nursing care. Mrs. Hillman knew many of her more than 253 scholarship recipients personally and took great pleasure in following their progress. She will be remembered fondly for her generosity, warmth, spirit and encouragement. We extend our deepest sympathies to all of her family and friends. Lawrence S.

When you arrive at the parking lot, you can hear the drumming in the distance, this thing that's calling you, beckoning you to come. It seemed like this strange kind of tribal activity. After I had really danced hard, I decided to go for a swim and ended up meeting a guy who was standing by my sarong when I came out. We hung out.

2007-11-11T00:00:00Z,"THE NEWS The dollar sank to a new low against the euro and to its lowest level in decades against the Canadian dollar and British pound. BEHIND THE NEWS The drop followed reports midweek that China might reduce the percentage of its $1.4 trillion in foreign currency reserves held in dollars and put it into other currencies to get a better return. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, didn't help matters when he warned that the economy would slow noticeably. But the dollar could have fallen even more if he had signaled that the Fed might lower interest rates again, since such cuts have helped to weaken the dollar, which tends to fall when interest rates decline."

My siblings and I were faced with a similar dilemma just last year in the case of our ailing, elderly mother. Like the writer's father, our mother had been denied anything by mouth to prevent aspiration and pneumonia. For six months she begged for food, for water -- for anything -- while we stood by conflicted and heartbroken trying to act in her best interests. Friends who had recently lost a parent steered us to a hospice. A palliative-care physician helped us realize that allowing our mother to eat and drink was the more compassionate course, no matter the possible consequences. Our mother lived six months more and enjoyed watermelon, pears, peaches, water -- and milkshakes. Did our decision hasten her death? Probably. But the comfort and pleasure she received by eating and drinking at will for those six months far outweighed anything else. In retrospect, we feel we made the right -- the compassionate -- decision."

2007-11-11T00:00:00Z,"The argument that low-income prekindergartners would thrive on a regimen of academics and ''direct instruction'' does not take into account that these children, even more than middle-class youngsters, need a rich preliteracy experience with the hands-on interactions that all children relish (Ann Hulbert, Oct. 28). That is precisely the way all children learn at 4 and 5 years old. Sooner is not better for the decoding of symbols, which is the basis of reading and mathematical notation, no matter how much easier it makes testing and measuring skills. Most young children are simply not neurologically ready for these tasks. They are more likely to zoom ahead when they hit age 6, ready to take on academics with confidence. And to assume that a ''developmentally sensitive'' prekindergarten does not demand that children ''listen up and follow routines'' is erroneous. A thoughtful pre-K program teaches students to be respectful, take turns, raise hands and learn from each other. The bottom line is that our government does not want to pay for the well-educated teachers, in good facilities, that our least-privileged children need and deserve."

In years of gunfights, cattle drives, galloping horses and saloons, only one movie ever galvanized me, one I saw on TV, in black and white: ''Broken Arrow,'' with Jeff Chandler as Cochise, James Stewart as Tom Jeffords and Debra Paget as the Apache girl Stewart is allowed to marry. Stewart was a real movie star, and I must have noticed him, but what sticks in my mind is the very thing that made the movie startling when it came out in 1950 -- the fact that it is sympathetic to the Native American point of view, as represented by Chandler, strikingly handsome and dignified as Cochise, and Jay Silverheels, rough-voiced and dynamic, as Geronimo."

There she met Andor Weininger, a talented artist, musician, performer and Bauhaus Band leader. They were married in 1931 in Berlin where they worked together creating modernist furniture and interior design. In 1938, Eva, Andor and their infant daughter fled Hitler's Germany. They lived in Holland for 13 years, then six years in Canada, finally settling in New York City in 1958. After Andor's death in 1986, Eva catalogued his work and welcomed a steady stream of art scholars to her Manhattan apartment. She founded the Weininger Foundation to ensure that future generations could learn from her vast collection of artworks, and made numerous donations to museums and universities around the world. Throughout her life, Eva's ability to confront hardship and challenges with curiosity, energy and humor were admirable. Eva's daughter, Cornelia, died in 1996. She is survived by her youngest sister, Renate Fuchs; her nieces Anita Younes, Gudula Khan and Linda Miller and her eight grandnieces and nephews."

I instantly agree, but it turns out we mean two different things. He's thinking of McCabe -- Warren Beatty, that is -- succumbing from his bullet wounds after going to ground in a snowstorm, then being enveloped by swirling flakes and the elegiac tones of Leonard Cohen's ''Winter Lady.'' Yes, this is one of the western's great death scenes. It completes one of the slowest and most heart-rending descents in all cinema; the shattering of McCabe's dreams comes to stand for a farewell to both the western tradition and to the sublimely fragile idealisms of the glamorous hippies both Beatty and McCabe really were beneath gruff western garb."

She was the Co-Chair of The New York Housing Conference, a life-time member of the National Housing Conference and Director Emeritus of Settlement Housing Fund. The Boards and Staffs of these organizations mourn her loss deeply. Clara originated the idea of combining low and moderate income housing with social programs, and she ran the first leadership training programs for new owners of middle income cooperative housing. She began her career in the field of early childhood education. She held numerous positions in government and non - profit organizations, wrote extensively and lectured frequently. Until the very end of her life, she was an active housing advocate, especially concerned about the lack of middle income housing in New York City. She had little patience with leaders who did not work hard enough to achieve effective housing programs. She was generous with her time and mentored her successors. We will especially miss her way with words and her wit. We offer our condolences to her daughter, Roberta Fox.

Mr. Goltzer retired from the Philharmonic in 1984 after a long and distinguished orchestral career. Born in Brooklyn, New York on July 25, 1918, he did not begin to study music until he was thirteen, while at Brooklyn's Tilden High School. Young Albert was a natural. In 1938, just nineteen years old, he was invited to join the New York Philharmonic by then music director Sir John Barbirolli, who heard him play chamber music at a party. Just before that, he had won a scholarship to Julliard as well as the Gabrilowitch Memorial Scholarship of the National Orchestral Association. He studied with Philharmonic musicians Engelbert Brenner, Bruno Labate and Michael Nazzi. Mr. Goltzer was so young he lied about his age so he could sign his contract with the orchestra. Mr. Goltzer took a leave of absence to serve in the military during World War II. In 1946, he assumed the position of solo oboist with the St. Louis Symphony. After his stay in St. Louis, he was solo oboe with the CBS Symphony and the WOR Orchestra, and a member of the New York Woodwind Quintet. In 1955, Mr. Goltzer was invited back to the New York Philharmonic by Dimitri Metropolis, where he played until 1984 as associate principal. Albert Goltzer made numerous recordings and was on the faculties of the Julliard, Mannes and Manhattan Schools of Music. He is survived by his beloved wife, Doris, an accomplished orchestral musician currently with the New York City Opera, son George and George's wife, Barbara Gertel Goltzer, son Seth, brother-in-law Alvin Delman, and grandchildren Andrew, Jill, Samantha and Adam.

She is survived by her mother, Sydney Cook, her sister Dana Baker, her brother Kyle Rosene, and their children and grandchildren. She had an honorary brother and sister as well, Bruce and Carole Stock. She was preceded in death by her beloved partner of thirty-one years, Stelyani Sandris. Kay received her law degree with honors from the University of Texas and had a distinguished career in the law, spending the last thirteen years before her 2007 retirement at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C., where she was in charge of production of many highly admired educational programs for the federal courts and was noted for her graceful and forceful writing on legal topics. While at the National Center for State Courts in 1989-1992, she also co-authored a book, Managing Notorious Cases, a well-known handbook. In partnership with Ms. Sandris she produced two award-winning films: Farenthold, on the second campaign of Frances ''Sissy'' Farenthold for the governorship of Texas, 1977, and More Than The Music, 1984, about a concert by pianist Mona Golabeck at a California women's prison. She wrote a book, Stella's Story; Fight For Life Against A Malignant Brain Tumor, and edited her partner's memoirs Greek Soul, Memories Of A Detroit Childhood. Kay was deeply interested in political matters and worked in various capacities for state and federal politicians and for a number of legal causes and issues. Her wide-ranging interests in these and in women's issues led her to make many friends and colleagues in Washington and California. She was a role model and mentor for a number of young women, as an example of what one woman could make of her life. Her love of travel made her many friends internationally. Few of those who met her will ever forget her. A memorial service will be held for Kay at the Spiritual Center, American University, 17 November at 10:30am. A luncheon will follow. Anyone wishing to speak at the service or to attend the luncheon should contact Lisa Fuentes at LisaFuentes@gmail.com or by phone at 202-222-6387.

2007-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Pumpkins used for jack-o'-lanterns are not the type best suited for pie; they are too watery and stringy. Many pie bakers, especially those who do not shop at farmer's markets, opt for the convenience of canned pumpkin. An alternative has just been introduced in a line of food products made by Heritage Family Specialty Foods, a Texas maker of private label foods. A hefty jar holds a rich, deep orange mixture of pumpkin, spices and sweeteners. The addition of three eggs and a cup of milk is all it takes to produce a pie filling that is mellow, fragrant and deliciously custardy, with an almost honey color. I was not too happy about the preservatives among the ingredients, which are at odds with the notions of heritage and home baking, but the result trumped this concern. The filling, called Classic Pumpkin Pie in a Jar, was made for Country Living Magazine, and is $12.99 from hfsfoods.com and macys.com."

For example, the grades upended a common perception -- that high-performing schools have more students from wealthy families, while low-performing schools are packed with students who qualify for free lunch, a measure of poverty. The new grading system considers a high-performing school one that raises its students' achievement from one year to the next. And so schools got more credit for student progress, regardless of where they started. The result: Schools with high marks were not only in well-heeled areas, and F schools were everywhere."

''Sometimes not making a decision is a good decision,'' one prosecutor said. Mr. Talen, above, who is the head of what he calls the Church of Stop Shopping, was arrested in June after he repeatedly recited the 45 words of the First Amendment through an unamplified megaphone during a rally in support of bicyclists. The police said he refused to stop when they asked him to, and followed them around. The amendment deals with ''the right of the people peaceably to assemble.''"

He mixes clear acrylic with inks and pigments, and pours it onto plastic-lined worktables, as if it were pancake batter, forming circles of varying sizes and thicknesses. Once they have dried, the disks are stacked into clusters and attached to a Belgian linen canvas. Now he is using the same technique to make ottomans, which are covered in a ''fabric'' of acrylic disks over a reinforced plywood frame that sits on glides.

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"CHEREN--Melvin. (January 21, 1933-December 7, 2007) Affectionately known as ''The Godfather of Disco'' for his championing of DJs, dance music and club culture from the early days of the Disco Movement, Mel began his five decade career in the music business at ABC/Paramount, where he eventually became Head of Production. He held the same position when he moved to Scepter Records. During his tenure at Scepter he was responsible for many innovations such as the first 12 inch record for DJs and the first instrumental mix on the B-side, earning Scepter the ''Trendsetter of the Year'' Award from Billboard in 1974. With a former Scepter colleague he formed his own company, West End Records in 1976, which has been associated for over 30 years with enduring dance classics like ''Hot Shot'' and ''Heartbeat''. In recent years West End released popular compilation CD's of remixes and live performances by legendary Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan. Mel was the financial backer of the landmark club created by his former life-partner Michael Brody. This history is well documented in Cheren's autobiography, My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep on Dancin' published in 2000 and in a recent documentary, The Godfather of Disco. In 2005 Mel was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame with their Lifetime Achievement Award, an honor which meant a great deal to him. For all of his accomplishments in the music industry, Mel was most proud of his work in support of various causes and charities and in particular his efforts in support of the LGBT Community and the fight against AIDS. He was part of the vanguard of gay men who first responded to the AIDS crisis in New York in the early Eighties and gave GMHC their first home in his Chelsea brownstone which he later operated for over 20 years as a successful bed-and-breakfast, the Colonial House Inn. He was the founder of 24 Hours For Life, an AIDS charity that was the fiscal sponsor for LIFEbeat, on whose Board he served as a Charter Director. Mel was also quietly a friend to many friends and strangers in need as well as an accomplished painter. A large number of Mel's works of art memorialize friends lost to AIDS. It is a sad irony that he is a fatality of the same health crisis that he fought so long to eradicate. Even in his last days he took a stand for AIDS prevention in a cautionary interview aired on the LOGO channel throughout the week of World AIDS Day. Mel Cheren is survived and will be greatly missed by many family members, prominent among them being Illya Dekhtyar, Mark Cheren and Barry Cherin, as well as a large extended family of close friends, colleagues and fellow activists. An announcement will soon be made about a memorial service/celebration and various memorial benefit parties taking place over the third weekend in January which would have marked his 75th birthday. Donations in Mel's honor can be made to GMHC, 119 West 24th Street, New York, New York 10011; The LGBT Community Center at 208 West 13th Street, New York, New York 10011; or LIFEbeat, 630 9th Avenue Suite 1010 New York, New York 10036."

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"THE ARISTOPHANIC LABORATORY The illustrious playwrights of ancient Greece gave us the tortured Oedipus, the grief-stricken Electra and the jealous and murderous Medea, among other dark and passionate characters, but every play coming out of Athens at that time was not necessarily tragic. Though we see the work of Aristophanes less frequently nowadays, he was toiling away too, writing bawdy, irreverent comedies with overtly political themes. This master of the Greek Old Comedy period is the only parodist from his era whose work survives today -- he wrote about 40 plays during his lifetime (around 450 to 388 B.C.), though fewer than a dozen are still extant. The Target Margin Theater, which spent last season breathing new life into Greek tragedy and philosophy, including adaptations of Plato's ''Symposium'' and Aristotle's ''Poetics,'' is lightening up things by devoting its 2007-8 season to Aristophanes. This is the last weekend of the Aristophanic Laboratory, a festival of adaptations and interpretations of the existing plays and fragments. The final offerings are ''The Name Means Public Spirited. Or, All Those Other Things,'' above, by Mallery Avidon, which is loosely adapted from ''Ecclesiazusae'' (say that 10 times fast -- it's eck-lee-zee-AH-zoo-sigh and kind of fun to say out loud), and takeoffs on ''Lysistrata'' and ''Peace,'' two of Aristophanes' most overt and imaginative pleas for peace. The plays may be old, but the themes, well, not so much. Most of Aristophanes' life was defined by the long and brutal Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, and his plays are filled with appeals for an end to the fighting."

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"'THE WHOLE SHOOTIN' MATCH' One of the finest films to play in New York this year was made on a shoestring budget in and around Austin, Tex., almost three decades ago. ''The Whole Shootin' Match'' was written, directed, photographed and edited by a grievously undersung independent talent named Eagle Pennell, who died in 2002 at 49, mostly forgotten after years of swimming and all but drowning in booze. Mr. Pennell was just 25 and a film school dropout when he made ''Shootin' Match'' in 1978 for an estimated $20,000. Shot in black-and-white 16 millimeter in a quasi-documentary visual style, with sensitive framing and attentively hand-held camerawork, the film follows the tragic-comic though more often than not comic-tragic adventures of two bosom buddies, Lloyd and Frank, wonderfully played by Lou Perryman (above, left, in a scene from the film) and Sonny Davis. Chronically just a few dollars away from broke, Lloyd and Frank spend their days dreaming and scheming, and occasionally working, angling for a way to get a leg up on fate, on luck and their aimless, rootless lives. Nights are reserved for boozing, philosophizing and nuzzling available women, as well as periodic barroom fisticuffs. Filled with hilarious observations and digressions, both verbal and visual, and characterized by a deeply felt and lived-in sense of place, ''The Whole Shootin' Match'' is an exemplar of American regional filmmaking or what Roger Ebert, in his glowing review, nicely called ''Wood-Burning Cinema.'' The film had other champions: It was shown at the 1979 New Directors/ New Films festival, where it received over-the-moon praise from Vincent Canby in this paper. It also apparently helped inspire Robert Redford to found the Sundance Film Festival. None of this seemed to have done much good for Mr. Pennell, who, after a ritualistic and predictably disappointing Hollywood stopover, faded from view. In 1999 Steve McVicker wrote a lengthy and terribly sad account of Mr. Pennell's rise and fall for the Houston Press, which you can still read online at houstonpress.com. Newly preserved, ''The Whole Shootin' Match'' will hit DVD soon, but catch it now in its big-screen glory.

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"'MILTON ROGOVIN: BUFFALO' The case of the Jewish optometrist Milton Rogovin is a sobering reminder of the adage that what goes around comes around. Persecuted in the 1950s because of his activities in the Communist Party, he is now celebrated as one of the great American documentary photographers of the postwar period. In 1999 the United States government, which had hauled him before the House Un-American Activities Committee, embraced him as a social and civil rights pioneer when the Library of Congress acquired more than 1,100 of his master prints, along with negatives and contact sheets. And now comes this 97-year-old artist's first large-scale gallery exhibition in Chelsea at Danziger Projects, focusing on his three-decade-long series of portraits of residents of the Lower West Side of Buffalo. A committed social-documentary artist, he shows little in the way of compositional tricks or technical frills. Nor was he interested in staging scenes or capturing decisive, dramatic moments. Mr. Rogovin wanted to show everyday people in their everyday lives -- young men in a bar; a girl on her way to school (above, from the series ''Lower West Side, 1969-1973''); a young boy lifting weights. His pictures are nonjudgmental, depicting his poor, frequently (but not exclusively) black subjects gently and lovingly. His photographs may not be great art, but they show America as it really was.

Livezey, Professor of Urban and Religious Studies and Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project at the Seminary. Dr. Livezey directed large studies of urban congregations, using ethnographic data assembled in collaboration with colleagues and students in Chicago, Boston, and New York. He argued that the ''religion factor'' is more salient than often recognized in the economic, demographic, and spatial restructuring of modern industrial cities. Dr. Livezey received the B.A. from Swarthmore College and the M. Th. and D. Min. degrees from the University of Chicago School of Divinity. He spent two decades in the peace movement before beginning his second career in studying communities, meanings, culture, and social change. In 2005, Dr. Livezey became the founding Director of the Ecologies of Learning Project (EOL) at NYTS, funded through a major grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. Lowell Livezey was a person of immense insight, wisdom and compassion, of great integrity and depth, and an outstanding colleague. He embodied the values of teaching, learning and research that lie at the heart of the scholarly endeavor. He also was a friend, a caring human being, someone around whom community was easily formed. In the language that is familiar to the people of faith, Lowell simply was a blessing to NYTS. Lowell helped us all understand the life and work of the churches and especially the intellectual task of preparation for ministry more clearly. Dr. Craig Dykstra, Senior Vice President, Religion of Lilly Endowment Inc., stated that ''Lowell Livezey's work on religion and urban culture is path-breaking -a permanent contribution. His patient, generous and imaginative work with pastors and other religious leaders in Chicago, Boston and New York, as well as with scholars, will bear great fruit for many years to come.''

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"KOCZY--Rosemarie Inge 68, of Croton-on-Hudson, NY, internationally renowned artist, succumbed on December 12, 2007 to inflammatory breast cancer. Born March 5, 1939 in Reckling-hausen, Germany to Jewish parents, she was deported in 1942 and survived two concentration camps. In 1959 she left Germany for Geneva to study art at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. Graduating with distinction in 1965, she soon gained recognition throughout Europe as a tapestry maker. A chance encounter with Peggy Guggenheim in Venice in 1973 led to an abiding friendship (and the commissioning of a tapestry) and contact with then Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum director Thomas Messer. By the mid-1970's the unexpressed trauma of her early years forced a change of direction in her work toward an open acknowledgment of the Holocaust. By the time Koczy accepted a fellowship to the MacDowell Colony in 1980 at Messer's invitation, she had already begun to create the signature pen and ink drawings memorializing the victims of the Shoah reverenced today throughout the world. In addition to hundreds of paintings, wood sculptures and other works, they alone numbered over 12,000 at the time of her death. Of them she wrote: ''The drawings I make every day are titled 'I Weave You A Shroud.' They are burials to those I saw die in camps.'' Esteemed in both mainstream and outsider art worlds but in the moral dimension apart from both, Koczy's work renowned in the Guggenheim, the Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne and Jerusalem's Yad Vashem, to give partial sense of its reach. Rosemarie Koczy's first marriage (which brought her Swiss citizenship) ended in divorce. She wed composer Louis Pelosi in 1984 and became an American citizen in 1989. She is survived by her husband, a sister Gisela and a half-brother Walter, both of Germany. She was interred at Bethel Cemetery, Croton on December 14. Her gravestone will read: ''I weave you a shroud...of love.''"

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"'THREE GENERATIONS OF JAZZ TRUMPET' Jazz lore and custom have largely pegged the trumpet as a young man's instrument. There is powerful precedent, from Buddy Bolden onward, for the earnest or brazen prodigy who blazes onto the scene. But however punishing the physical demands of the trumpet (or in the case of Bolden and others, the cornet), it also clearly rewards experience. For every bold arrival, it seems, there's a well-traveled elder with lessons to impart. ''Three Generations of Jazz Trumpet,'' one of several concerts organized at Symphony Space by the former Dizzy Gillespie protégé Jon Faddis, advances this guildlike notion. (It doesn't do anything to show that women are strong stewards of the horn; that point demands its own concert.) Naturally, the evening's anchor is Mr. Faddis, a smarter trumpeter at 55 then he was at 25, if not a more dazzling one. His latest release, ''Teranga'' (Koch), showcases his composure with the same rhythm section that supports him here: David Hazeltine on piano, Kiyoshi Kitagawa on bass and Dion Parson on drums."

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"After turning up late and stumbling about the stage of the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, England, the trouble-prone British soul singer Amy Winehouse, 24, left, listened to boos, heard jeers and saw members of the audience walking out on Wednesday night, Agence France-Presse reported. ''Let me tell you something,'' she said as she began a 17-date British tour. ''First of all, if you're booing, you're a mug for buying a ticket. Second, to all those booing, just wait till my husband gets out of incarceration -- and I mean that.'' The reference was to her spouse, Blake Fielder-Civil, who is being held in Pentonville Prison in London, accused of perverting justice and assaulting the landlord of a pub. The concert's closing number, ''Valerie,'' ended when Ms. Winehouse stopping singing, dropped the microphone and walked off the stage. Andy Coleman, the music critic of The Birmingham Mail, said the concert was ''one of the saddest nights of my life.'' ''I saw a supremely talented artist reduced to tears,'' he continued, ''stumbling around the stage and, unforgivably, swearing at the audience.''"

Johnson to participate in the White House Conference on International Law and International Cooperation. In addition to his professorship at St. John's, he was also on the panel of Arbitrators of The American Arbitration Association. By the time he retired as Professor of Law at St. John's in 1984, he had taught and inspired generations of young lawyers and future leaders in business and government. After his retirement from St. John's, Professor Wang became the senior partner of Wang and Wang in Taipei, a law firm specializing in transnational law. St. John's honored him in 1984 with the President's Medal, in 1987 with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, and in 1992 with the Medal of Honor. In 2003, Soochow University honored him with the naming of the Kenneth Wang School of Law. He will always be honored in the hearts of his family, friends and students. Services were private.

2007-11-16T00:00:00Z,"'THE THREE SILLIES' Along with acne, voice changes and growth spurts, intense embarrassment over your parents is an undeniable symptom of puberty. Usually poor Mom and Dad don't have to be guilty of more than existing, but Sammy, heroine of ''The Three Sillies'' at the Looking Glass Theater, finds her family's behavior especially cringe-inducing. Her father, with his bird calls and tickle attacks, makes you think of Robin Williams on amphetamines; her mother, whose voice is as loud as her outfits, is his perfect mate. And Sammy's younger sister, Sally, shows no signs of outgrowing her own silliness. Directed and written by Aliza Shane, ''The Three Sillies'' unfolds on Sammy's birthday, when she finds herself seriously in need of seriousness. After discovering that her old talking teddy bear (Mark DeFrancis, above right) is capable of original speech, Sammy (Ayelet Blumberg, center) is surprised that he agrees to run away with her. But he does make her promise that she will return home if they can find three bigger sillies than her folks."

There is little reliable data on the extent of his misiones for the poor (financed by oil revenue). But while filming for two weeks in October, for HDNet World Report in Maracaibo, Caracas and at a massive cult gathering of 10,000 spiritualists outside Barquisimeto (celebrating Chávez’s Day of Indigenous Resistance, formerly Columbus Day), I talked to people from all over Venezuela.

What a President Obama would offer is a new avenue to power and respect, not through military might, but through cooperation and understanding.

''Once I'm onstage, I feel complete,'' says this New York-based tabla player, who was the first female musician to perform in post-Taliban Kabul. A Minneapolis native, she studied tabla -- a traditional North Indian drum -- with the master Alla Rakha and has collaborated with the hip-hop producer Timbaland. She takes her blend of electronic and classical Indian music everywhere, from Brooklyn (where she recorded her most recent album, ''Blueprint'') to a royal palace in Jodhpur, India (''the acoustics are amazing''), but Suphala finds some of her most attentive audiences at the airport. ''It's a given that my tabla gets lots of looks at security,'' she says. ''The case does look like something out of 'Star Wars.'''"

Here, she wears a Cadeau maternity jacket with Habitual maternity jeans. Her shoes are by Christian Louboutin. ''What's nice about the jacket is that it's casual but it also pops, so you can go somewhere in the evening,'' she said. ''I've also been wearing short skirts and some little dresses.

His suit was disheveled, his bow to Janet Flanner courtly, and his refusal to shake Gore Vidal's extended hand caused a murmuring in the audience. When I said I couldn't help noticing what had just happened, I was told by Mailer that he did not approve of Vidal and found him intellectually shameless. Mailer's mission, it became rapidly clear, was to eviscerate Vidal for what Vidal had written about him in The New York Review of Books. This was tossed about a bit and Mailer told Vidal that if Vidal could teach him something about writing, he would look up to him.

Can you explain? What I was driving at was that it was a foolish time to have a strike issue over a business and a marketplace that is not evolved enough to even know if there is a business or a marketplace there. But aren't television networks already making money from programs that appear on the Internet, which is what the striking writers want a piece of? No. The areas in which they are making money, which let's call the reuse areas -- the movies to be downloaded, or television series to be downloaded -- are areas in which I believe the producers have agreed to make a deal. The area where they cannot make a deal is original production for the Internet, which is neither profitable nor is it clear in exactly what direction it's going to go."

When he finally arrived to the United States of America, he became an active member of the anti-Castro organization El CID (Cuba Independence Democratica). He traveled to the Dominican Republic where once again he spoke out against communism. He created ''Escuelitas de la Patria'' with the objective for Cuban children to preserve their first language and culture on the radio broadcast ''Radio Marti.''

He introduced District 14 to Spanish reading series ''A CADA PASO'', to teach children how to read in Spanish phonetically. He was the Co-founder of the Spanish Bilingual Program at Mercy College where he taught undergraduate and graduate courses. He was also a Professor at L.I.U and St. John's University.

There are no words to express how much I loved and respected you both as a father, confidant, advisor and the greatest ''Papa'' to my son Jack.

A day will never go by as long as I live that you will be out of my thoughts. I will live the rest of my life as if you are still here guiding me daily. The love you showed for your grandson was nothing short of remarkable. Calling every day to see how he was, what new things he had to say, and the most endearing was the way you just stared at him every time he was with you, never taking your hand away from him for a minute. He knew when we were going to ''Papa's'', you would be out in front of the house waiting for us to arrive, and again watching the car when we left. Your love for him was an inspiration to me and a lesson on not just loving, but how to show that love. You will be missed more than you could ever know.

2007-11-21T00:00:00Z,"Doctors reading the results of a blood test widely used to screen for prostate cancer can be fooled into thinking obese men are disease free, researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The test may yield falsely reassuring results because obese people have more blood in their bodies because of their girth, diluting the concentration of the protein doctors use to detect the presence of tumors, researchers said. The prostate gland produces a protein called prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A. If levels are higher, that suggests the cells are growing, which can be a sign of cancer, although an enlarged prostate can also send the levels up. Researchers examined records for nearly 14,000 men who had surgery for prostate cancer from 1988 to 2006. “It’s not that P.S.A. is a bad test in obese men.” Dr. Stephen Freedland, a researcher, said. “Rather, we just need to learn how to use it better.”."

2007-11-21T00:00:00Z,"If you’re hunting for Golden Bear tracks — that is, a sampling of Jack Nicklaus’s course designs—you will surely bag your limit along Florida’s Gold Coast, where Nicklaus has resided since the early 1970s. Among his best are two layouts of recent vintage in Palm Beach County, the Bear’s Club and its next-door neighbor, the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, Jupiter. The latter course in particular illuminates Nicklaus’ evolution as a designer. Gone are the gigantic, unnatural conical mounds, vast waste bunkers and fiercely protected elevated greens that graced many of his early works. In their stead is a set of low-key holes that flow through dense stands of pine, palmetto and native scrub, with greens that are receptive to a variety of approaches. Artful contouring, deep, if smallish bunkers and just the right number of strategically deployed hazards keep the scratch golfer at bay, but fairways are amply wide, thus allowing Mr. Once-a-Week a pleasurable day. If your connections can’t land you on one of these private Nicklaus nooks, check out PGA National Resort & Spa’s Champion Course, which Nicklaus redesigned in 1990. A former Ryder Cup and PGA Championship site, it is current home to the PGA Tour’s Honda Classic. For those on a budget, North Palm Beach Country Club is your ticket. Jack’s gift to his adopted hometown was to reconfigure its tired muni into a local treasure—and he did it for the princely design fee of $1. Reopened in November 2006, the rolling, 7,100-yard layout boasts two holes along the Intracoastal Waterway and a high season green fee that’s well south of $100. For bargain hunters, that’s a Bear worth stalking. www.ritzcarltonrealestate.com, 561-691-8700; www.pgaresort.com, 561-627-1800; www.village-npb.org, 561-691-3420."

For decades, Victor courageously was in the forefront of the fight for civil liberties when only a few were willing to stand up to the onslaught of the McCarthy era. He believed that his task was not only to expose the law's inequities but ''to carry on the necessary legal activities in a professionally competent and politically principled fashion.'' For more than six decades, Victor did precisely that--representing with extraordinary skill and commitment the militant labor movement, the targets of McCarthy-era repression, the civil rights movement, Vietnam-era protesters, Cuba and Allende's Chile. He served as an inspiration, teacher, mentor and friend to several generations of young lawyers, in our office and in the National Lawyer's Guild, who hope to use their talents and careers in the service of something more important than the pursuit of money and status. We will miss Victor, and we will try to carry on as he would have wished. Victor's family will be holding a memorial sometime in January. The family has asked that anyone wishing to remember Victor with a contribution, to consider the L. M. Rabinowitz Foundation, 18 Fountain Street, Clinton, NY 13323.

2007-11-21T00:00:00Z,"STEMMERMANN--Dr . Grant N. A noteworthy pathologist and epidemiologist died on Saturday in Cincinnati. He was 89. The cause was cardiac arrhythmia. A native of New York City, Dr. Stemmermann attended Trinity College and Cornell University, and received his M.D. from McGill University in 1943. During WWII, he served as Battalion Surgeon with the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion in Okinawa, then returned to New York to complete his residency at Sea View and Richmond Memorial Hospitals on Staten Island. After 2 years as Assistant Pathologist at Halloran VA Hospital on Staten Island, he moved to Hilo, Hawaii, to be Head Pathologist at Hilo Memorial Hospital. In 1950, as Director of Laboratories at Kuakini Hospital in Honolulu, he initiated his groundbreaking studies of heart disease and cancer. As Principal Investigator of the Honolulu Heart Program, he contacted men who had fought in WWII in the famed 442nd Battalion, and gathered background information from each man. He then continued to follow this group in an ongoing study. In 1971, with the collaboration of colleagues in Japan, Dr. Stemmermann expanded these studies of second-generation Japanese - Ameri cans to include data from similar populations in Japan to assess the impact of western lifestyles upon their disease experience. After retirement, he continued to refine this research, and in 1993 took a position with the University of Cincinnati Medical School, where he worked until his death. In recognition of his work, Dr. Stemmermann participated in meetings in Japan organized by the Crown Princess Takamatsu, honoring those who have made significant contributions to cancer research. He was also recognized in 2000 by the Hawaii State Legislature for his exceptional service and outstanding contributions to the betterment of the community. He is survived by his wife Nell, daughters Maile, Mele, and Rachel. Donations in his memory can be sent to McGill University (Bursary Fund, Faculty of Medicine class of 1943), and the Cincinnati Chapter of the American Cancer Society."

2007-11-22T00:00:00Z,"San Francisco supervisors have rejected a proposal, spurred by Mayor Gavin Newsom’s affair with a staff member, that would have banned City Hall managers from having “romantic or sexual relationships” with subordinates.

The decision did not represent any loss of hope for recovering the men’s bodies, he said. The walls can be removed, he said. The miners were trapped on Aug. 6.

The tree is actually an assembly of five of Mr. Boontje's Xmas Light kits, which were introduced in 2005, and which each include a strand of white lights, two sheets of lace made from Tyvek and a hook to hang your creation from the ceiling. The set of five kits ($419) results in a 26-inch-diameter tree that is 84 inches tall, above; the idea is to stack three of the fixtures and use the other two to round out the shape.

Though the university was unnoted in your article and unmarked on the accompanying map, it is not only the Valley’s largest employer but also its chief attractor and generator of creative talent in the arts and humanities. Distinguished poets and novelists on its faculty or among its alumni include James Tate, Sabina Murray, Martín Espada, Natasha Trethewey, Susan Straight and many other prestigious award winners. Recent public readings on campus involved Suzan-Lori Parks, Tony Kushner, Salman Rushdie and the late Grace Paley.

But in her latest incarnation she has many strings; she never goes anywhere without them. Yet Pippi is still Pippi. Her new circumstances derive from her stardom at the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, where the musical ''Pippi'' honors the centennial of Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish author of the Pippi books and a woman ahead of her time. Her diminutive heroine, with her red pigtails and disarming honesty, is fiercely independent. Pippi, above right, with her monkey, has no need for a prince or a magical godmother; if necessary, she can rescue herself."

2007-11-23T00:00:00Z,"TANGO MEETS JAZZ FESTIVAL The dialogue between Argentine tango and American jazz has a history stretching back at least half a century, to the worldly innovations of Astor Piazzolla. An inspired composer and a master of the bandoneón (a type of button accordion), Piazzolla essentially created ''nuevo tango,'' which absorbs both classical counterpoint and jazz improvisation without losing the dramatic and mournful character of tango. To most outside observers, Piazzolla's high-flying brand of tango has come to represent the mainstream; some leading practitioners of tango today, like the pianist Pablo Ziegler, above, come to their authority partly as his former sidemen. Yet exploration in this realm hardly stopped after Piazzolla's death in 1992. Anyone now in search of tango-infused modern jazz (or, at times, the inverse) can seek out strong recent albums by the trumpeter Diego Urcola, the bassists Pedro Giraudo and Pablo Aslan, or the pianists Emilio Solla and Fernando Otero.

2007-11-23T00:00:00Z,"DEVINE DANCE COMPANY ''Riverdance'' took the world by storm in 1994, when that Irish dancing spectacle was first seen at the Eurovision Song Contest. It has since spawned numerous offspring and imitators, and while it shows no sign of losing its appeal, for some the thrill is long gone. ''It seems a lot of the subsequent Irish dance shows have used that formula to present their productions,'' said the Irish dancer James Devine, whose dance company is wrapping up a critically lauded show at the family-friendly New Victory Theater. Mr. Devine, who holds the Guinness world record for fastest dancer, was invited to perform in Michael Flatley's ''Lord of the Dance'' in 1996, but the format wasn't for him. ''I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to present something that isn't about 34 dancers in a row,'' he said, ''and the bigger spectacle taking over the art form itself? I wanted to reduce it to something that was more stripped back, and had more edginess.'' That show is ''Tapeire,'' above, which ends this weekend and is, indeed, stripped back: Mr. Devine is the lone dancer. Working with an electric harpist, a percussionist and a fiddler, he presents his particular brand of 21st-century Irish dance, which folds American rhythm tap into sean-nos. A Gaelic term meaning ''old-school,'' sean-nos refers to dancing that is lower to the ground, with a relaxed upper body, like tap. ''That style of Irish dance is what would have emigrated with the people, when there was that mixing of cultures,'' Mr. Devine explained. ''That's really what was brought over, not the high kicks of modern Irish dance schools today. That's what I've eliminated from the show, to be quite honest, that leaping around the stage -- that's just spectacle dance, it's not really communicating anything.'' (Today and tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., with a talk today after the 2 p.m. show. New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 646-223-3010, newvictory.org; $12.50 to $35.) CLAUDIA LA ROCCO"

Mr. Pitt cited concerns over the script and a writers' strike that is preventing problems from being solved quickly. Mr. Pitt and the film's director, Kevin Macdonald (''The Last King of Scotland''), met several times recently to try to work out the problems but were unable to do so. Mr. Pitt was to play a reporter investigating the death of a political researcher. Shooting was to begin Nov. 15. Helen Mirren and Ed Norton are also featured in the cast, for the moment at least: Universal Pictures will need to replace Mr. Pitt quickly or risk losing other actors to scheduling conflicts if the delay goes on too long."

2007-11-23T00:00:00Z,"KLEYNKUNST! After the First World War, Poland became an independent nation after more than a hundred years of foreign rule. In Warsaw, where a quarter of the population was Jewish, the city's rising class of secular Jews included lots of artistic types who were riding the new wave of Polish nationhood and looking toward a bright future. Kleynkunst teaters (little art houses) thrived during this vibrant period, offering irreverent, politically charged Yiddish cabaret that drew from a variety of sources, including Weimar cabaret, Russian folk music, jazz, tango and traditional cantorial music. Sadly, it's a type of performance that has largely been lost to time, but Rebecca Joy Fletcher, the writer and creator of ''Kleynkunst! Warsaw's Brave and Brilliant Yiddish Cabaret,'' is bringing it back. ''It's almost unimaginable for most American Jews how vital, hip and avant-garde Yiddish-speaking Warsaw was between the wars,'' she said. Ms. Fletcher, who is also a cantor, started working on her theatrical cabaret about a year ago. With the help of research assistants in Israel and Poland, as well as several professors and ethnomusicologists, she has tried to recreate an authentic Yiddish cabaret while simultaneously telling the story of the art form itself. The show, performed in both English and Yiddish, includes songs from the period in new arrangements by Bob Goldstone. And if you don't speak Yiddish, no need to fear -- the majority of the text is in English, and the Yiddish parts are translated on supertitles in both English and Russian."

Among them is Lehmann Maupin, which has opened a satellite space on Chrystie Street, where, beginning on Thursday, it will show the work of the Korean artist Do Ho Suh. At the same time he has mounted a big companion exhibition in the gallery's Chelsea premises, the centerpiece of which is ''Cause & Effect,'' left, an enormous theatrical installation in the shape of a twirling tornado made out of thousands of plastic interlocking figurines stacked on top of one another and densely hung from the ceiling. It is like a Dale Chihuly sculpture crossed with the chandelier in the Palais Garnier, crossed with the Weather Channel. It is quite different from most of the art in Chelsea now. Even though the piece looks good, it is hard to comprehend its meaning. It allows us to get up close to and see the wonder of nature, but why is it made of cheap figurines turned out by workers in a studio factory operated by Mr. Suh in South Korea? Maybe it's a metaphor for late-capitalist decadence, in which the art world can feel at times like a vortex of glistening banality. My sense is that it is decorative, a sweetly pretty focal point for a room where it need not give off any meaning. (Through Dec. 22, Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea; Thursday through Feb. 2, ''Do Ho Suh: Part Two,'' 201 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side; 212-255-2923, lehmannmaupin.com.)

That Major Harris-led team lost to Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl.If West Virginia defeats Connecticut today and Pittsburgh next week, it will most likely play for the national title on Jan. 7 in New Orleans. That notion hasn't been lost on the locals.Zippy Shearer, a member of that 1988 team, said in the parking lot before the game that folks at a local Buffalo Wild Wings last night celebrated Arkansas's upset of top-ranked Louisiana State by hoisting chairs in the air. The Arkansas victory put West Virginia, which entered the week No. 3 in the Bowl Championship Series, into the top two.""Our run came a little more out of nowhere,"" Shearer said in comparing his team with the current team. ""They were ranked to start the season.""The feeling that the Mountaineers are on the cusp of something special could be felt throughout the parking lots surrounding Milan Puskar Stadium.Bill Henderson had just finished deep-frying a turkey at his tailgate, which was marked by the pirate flag hanging over the trailer.

2007-11-24T00:00:00Z,"Günter Grass, the Nobel Prize-winning author, has sued Random House over a claim in a new biography that he volunteered to serve in the Nazis' Waffen SS unit, Agence France-Presse reported yesterday, citing the online edition of the German magazine Der Spiegel. Mr. Grass, right, is seeking an injunction against the publishing house over a phrase in a biography by Michael Jürgs, which reads: ''Günter Grass admitted ... that as a 17-year-old he willingly joined the Waffen SS.'' Mr. Grass wrote last year in his autobiography ''Peeling the Onion'' that he was drafted into the Waffen SS in the final months of World War II, an admission for which he was widely condemned because he had kept his Nazi service a secret for more than 60 years while urging other Germans to confront their painful histories. Mr. Grass told a Berlin district court that Mr. Jürgs had knowingly erred in writing that he had joined the Waffen SS willingly, his lawyer told Der Spiegel. He said Mr. Grass has handed the court a statement asserting, ''The conscription into the Waffen SS happened without my active participation.'' Mr. Jürg's book, ''Günter Grass,'' is published in Germany by Goldmann, which is owned by Random House, itself a subsidiary of Bertlesmann, a German company. A legal representative for Goldmann said the book would remain on sale pending a court ruling."

2007-11-24T00:00:00Z,"The earliest known full-length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I was sold at Sotheby's in London for £2.6 million (about $5.4 million), Bloomberg News reported yesterday. The price was a record for any British royal portrait, the auction house said, and more than double the pre-auction estimate. The winning bidder was Philip Mould, a London art dealer, who bought the portrait, above, along with another dealer. The painting was originally given by the queen to Griffith Hampden, the sheriff of Buckinghamshire, on a visit to Hampden House, Sotheby's said. The image dates from the 1560s and may have been painted by the Antwerp artist Steven van der Meulen. The work may have been intended to attract potential suitors, but Queen Elizabeth, known as the Virgin Queen, never married."

2007-11-24T00:00:00Z,"A federal appeals court ruled that Sony Music must pay the founder of a small record company $5 million for failing to put his company's logo on reissues of Meat Loaf's album ''Bat Out of Hell,'' The Associated Press reported yesterday. Steve Popovich, the founder of Cleveland International Records, signed Meat Loaf, then known as Marvin Lee Aday, and in 1977 persuaded Epic Records, a unit of CBS Records, to release his album. Sony later bought CBS Records and paid $6.7 million to Mr. Popovich and his former partners to settle a lawsuit over royalties from ''Bat Out of Hell.'' The settlement required Sony to place the Cleveland International logo on future Meat Loaf albums, but Sony did not add the logo to ''Bat Out of Hell'' for more than a year. In a 2-to-1 decision reached Wednesday, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati upheld a federal jury's 2005 decision awarding Mr. Popovich $5 million in damages. ''I worked too hard for them and made them too much money to get robbed now, in the autumn of my life,'' Mr. Popovich said. ''Bat Out of Hell'' has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide."

Agence France-Presse reported that last week Ms. Nasreen, right, a self-proclaimed feminist and atheist, was being moved repeatedly, disguised in a black burqa, as authorities in India sought to assure her safety following violent Islamist protests calling for her expulsion from the country. ''I am mentally distressed; I am not well at all,'' Ms. Nasreen told the Press Trust of India on Friday by telephone from an undisclosed location. She has lived in the Indian state of West Bengal since 2004, in an apartment guarded by Indian security forces, while seeking permanent residence in India, which is officially a secular country. So far, however, the government, fearful of upsetting the country's large Muslim minority, has granted her only six-month visa extensions. The All India Milli Council, a Muslim group, said in New Dehli on Friday that all Muslim organizations would ''vehemently protest'' her continued stay. In March, an offshoot group of the influential All India Muslim Personal Law Board declared a reward for anyone who ''beheaded ... the notorious woman'' who has ''has put Muslims to shame.''

2007-11-24T00:00:00Z,"SIOUX CITY, Iowa Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton had some tough words Saturday afternoon for the college student loan industry, saying banks and other lenders had ''ripped off'' students with high interest rates and repayment plans that were onerous on recent graduates and their families. ''I want to get rid of the student loan companies,'' Mrs. Clinton said at an event in Sioux City, as she laid out her college affordability plan in response to a parent's concern about high tuition prices. ''I kept working and I got a little scholarship, and I borrowed money from the government at 2% interest.'' ''I'm asking myself, why are we making it so expensive and costly for families today?'' she continued. ''I also want to eliminate the complicated form that families have to fill out. I don't know how many of you have had to fill out those forms, it takes dozens and dozens of pages.'' Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, battled the student loan industry in the 1990s as he championed the Federal Direct Loan Program, which eliminated for-profit lenders as the middlemen for students in that program. And an ally of Mrs. Clinton's, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, has been waging legal fights against several lenders, accusing them of unscrupulous tactics to bilk students. Mrs. Clinton also supports the direct loan program, and she has also called for a ''student borrower's bill of rights.'' According to her campaign website, this proposal would ''make it easier for students to repay loans and give them a basic set of enforceable rights. ''It would give student borrowers the right to fair monthly payments that do not exceed a percentage of their incomes, as well as access to fair interest rates and fees. The bill would also give students the right to shop in a free marketplace for their lender and to borrow without exploitation. Finally, the bill will give students access to better information about their loans to provide students with better options during repayment.'' Mrs. Clinton's campaign event in Sioux City was chiefly devoted to fighting autism; she pledged to spend $700 million a year to expand research on the causes of autism and monitor its impact nationwide, and to create a task force to investigate treatments and services for those with autism. Her remarks about getting ''rid'' of student loan companies came as part of a length answer during the Q&A portion of the event with the audience, and was not part of a pre-planned attack on the industry, aides said. Mrs. Clinton has been critical of student lenders before, casting herself as an ally of middle-class families struggling with the rising cost of attending college. But taking on for-profit lenders, if she choose to, would come with risks: It is a multi-billion-dollar industry with powerful allies in Congress, many of them Republicans, thanks in part of campaign contributions over the years."

I did not see a recent discussion about George Orwell on one of the TV book-chat programs, but I heard the participants discussed how language (and, inevitably, our understanding of events) is increasingly corrupted by feel-good phrases, like ""support our troops"" - mainly offered by political conservatives and spread by the media to help avoid scrutiny. I mention this because the fashion industry is under extreme pressure from marketing. One of the biggest marketing/PR hoaxes is that grand old Paris fashion houses should be revived. Why on earth do we need Schiaparelli? Ah, because Diego Della Valle can make some money. It's not complicated. There is no altruistic motive (let's save a great name!). The fashion world, like the literary and art worlds, is full of great names that only a few people take the time and interest to investigate. But it's limited, and should be limited. So they are reviving Ossie Clark-to capitalize on the fact that dozens of designers have already dipped into the Ossie well? Too late. Anyway, I'm not interested. I am intrigued by the latest Halston revival, mainly because of the players involved and because I like the challenge of seeing Halston done in a contemporary way.

They ask you to pay a few dollars and promise to dispose of your old gear in a responsible manner. If you wanted to forgo that expense and even recoup some of your original investment, your best choice was to sell the device on a site like eBay. Brett Mosley, 25, of Denver, has an even more appealing idea. About a year ago, Mr. Mosley started BuyMyBrokeniPod.com and began buying, refurbishing and reselling used or broken iPods. Mr. Mosley, who is apparently comfortable around a soldering iron, started the company by posting an ad on Craigslist seeking damaged iPods.

2007-11-27T00:00:00Z,"British Airways said it would not increase its stake in Iberia Líneas Aéreas de España, dimming prospects that British Airways would be part of a takeover bid for Iberia and increasing the likelihood that it would remain in Spanish hands. By not exercising its right to buy shares being sold by two of Iberia’s Spanish investors, British Airways and the American private equity firm TPG are unlikely to mount a full takeover bid of 3.4 billion euros ($5 billion), as was expected, analysts said. The decision opens the door for Caja Madrid, a large Spanish savings bank, to raise its interests in Iberia. Caja Madrid said last week that it wanted to exercise its own option to buy the Iberia shares held by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Logista, the logistics arm of Altadis, raising its stake in the Spanish carrier to about 24 percent."

The defendants were given materials to prepare their defense; they later pleaded guilty. The 18-page motion says the government request — which was made under seal and signed by a judge Sept. 11 — is “futile” and “unenforceable” because the sealed materials have already been widely shared, leaked and published outside of the criminal defense team. It also argues that the order would pose “an open-ended danger” of further leak investigations against the defendants, Conte, James Valente (Balco’s former vice president), Barry Bonds’s former trainer Greg Anderson and the track coach Remi Korchemny. It argues they may need the materials to prepare for testimony in future cases.

The film, ''Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal,'' produced for 160 million rupees ($4 million), is set among London's Asian residents and includes some Bollywood stars, who are popular in Pakistan despite the official ban on their work. The film, a football drama, is to open in seven cities in Pakistan, including Karachi and Lahore. The arrangement is anything but straightforward, however. ''We got the permission because 'Goal' is technically a U.K. production, which was funded via a specially set up London-based banner, Aim Films,'' said Siddharth Roy Kapur, the chief operating officer of UTV Motion Pictures, based in Mumbai, which made the film.

(NBC) CHRISTMAS IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER Nick Lachey, Al Roker and Ashley Tisdale help flip the switch at this 75th tree-lighting ceremony, whose real star is an 84-foot-tall Norway spruce from Connecticut (above, the scene last year). But if you thought New York's Christmas tree was already green, think again. This year its brilliance will come from 30,000 solar-powered light-emitting diodes strung along five miles of wire, which will reduce energy consumption to 1,297 kilowatt hours a day from 3,510 kilowatt hours -- saving about the same amount of energy that a family in a 2,000-square-foot house might use in a month. According to City Hall, the tree was also cut with a hand-held saw to save energy. After Christmas it will be turned into lumber for Habitat for Humanity. Tonight Natasha Bedingfield, Tony Bennett, Celine Dion, Sean Kingston, Carrie Underwood and others sing in the holiday season. 8 P.M. (ABC) SHREK THE HALLS Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas lend their voices to this half-hour special spun off from the ''Shrek'' movies. Everyone's favorite ogre tries to muster a little holiday spirit for the sake of his princess bride, Fiona, and their children, but Donkey, Puss in Boots and Gingy, for all their good intentions, just end up spoiling his plans."

This month, another distinguished crew (see their bios on the right) will spend two weeks tackling ""The Education of Henry Adams,"" an American classic published 100 years ago this year. Well, sort of: The memoir, which covers the years from Adams's birth in 1838 to the death of Adams's great friend the statesman John Hay in 1905, was printed in a luxurious private edition in 1907 and circulated to 100 or so friends - including then-president Theodore Roosevelt - who were invited to return it with comments and corrections in the extra-wide margins. (Only three complied.) The book was republished for a general audience in 1918, the year of Adams's death. An unsigned review in the New York Times Book Review called it ""a book every American should read."" It won the Pulitzer Prize."

But the Public Theater, which doggedly tends to uncover the new, is offering a festival next week featuring the work of American Indian artists from the United States and Canada. Oskar Eustis, the Public's artistic director, created a similar event when he was the artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company in Rhode Island, but this Native Theater Festival is his first time doing it in New York.

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"According to a new report from the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, the economic impact of even a long strike by screenwriters would not be much. If the strike, now about four weeks old, were to last for five months, the report said, the Los Angeles area would see economic activity drop by about $380 million, or roughly one-tenth of 1 percent of the region's $380 billion in annual activity, and personal income growth for area residents would fall by just a quarter of 1 percent in 2008. Written by the economist Jerry Nickelsburg, the report, released yesterday, described the strike's likely effect as ''modest and transitory.'' It said widely published higher estimates of the strike's impact had failed to account for the entertainment industry's stockpiling of programs and movies; spending by consumers on other entertainment; and the large number of reality television shows, which are unaffected by the walkout."

''It's a step forward,'' Douglas Frith, president of the Canadian Motion Pictures Distributors Association, said after Louis-Rene Hache of Montreal was charged Wednesday with recording in a movie theater for commercial distribution. Mr. Hache was arrested on Oct. 26 and charged with recording the Touchstone Pictures comedy ''Dan in Real Life'' at a movie theater in Montreal. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and was released ahead of his next scheduled court appearance on Jan. 21. His arrest was made possible in part after a $5,000 night-vision system to detect digital-camera lenses was installed in the Guzzo Lacordaire multiplex cinema, described as a target of illegal videotapers. Mr. Hache faces a fine or up to two years in prison if found guilty of recording a movie without a theater's permission and a fine or up to five years in prison if convicted of recording for commercial gain."

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"THE BARNARD PROJECT University dance departments have budgets, studios, and students eager to work with real-life choreographers. And choreographers have budget constraints, time constraints, space constraints. Putting the two together could help both parties, Mary Cochran, chairwoman of the Barnard College dance department, realized. And so was born the Barnard Project, a collaboration between Dance Theater Workshop and Barnard, now in its third year. ''The choreographers get to use far more bodies than they could normally afford to pay, which is fun for them,'' Ms. Cochran said, ''and the students are so energized by the different creative processes that they experience.'' The strength of the project is in its choice -- made by Ms. Cochran and Carla Peterson, the artistic director of Dance Theater Workshop -- of experienced choreographers with strong, distinctive voices. This year Gerald Casel, Amanda Loulaki, RoseAnne Spradlin and Keith A. Thompson have created works for 44 students in the dance departments of both Barnard and Columbia University, and the fruits of that collaboration will be offered at Dance Theater Workshop next week.

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"THE JAZZ PASSENGERS Music making and storytelling have long been inextricable for Roy Nathanson, the saxophonist and composer best known for his work with the Jazz Passengers. When he formed that group 20 years ago -- with the trombonist Curtis Fowlkes, whom he had met in a Big Apple Circus band -- Mr. Nathanson brought some idiosyncratic ideas about jazz and narrative. The typical Jazz Passengers album includes a bolt of polyphonic bluster, a dash of sly grace and a bit of archly hard-boiled language, either spoken or sung. The Jazz Passengers haven't worked much as a full band in recent years, notwithstanding the odd performance with Deborah Harry, formerly of Blondie. But Mr. Nathanson has kept sharpening his style through projects like ''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill,'' a song cycle featuring, among others, Ms. Harry and Elvis Costello. In ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), released last year, Mr. Nathanson works alongside Mr. Fowlkes, the violinist (and fellow Passenger) Sam Bardfeld, the bassist Tim Kiah and the vocal percussionist Napoleon Maddox.

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"Joel Shapiro's latest show is exquisite: a focused, perfect arrangement of just under a dozen sculptures filling Pace Wildenstein in Chelsea. This may well be the artist's best effort in years. The work may look old-fashioned to some, with its attention to relationships between abstraction and representation, its choice of weighty materials (wood and bronze) and its heroic scale. The pieces may even be reminiscent of David Smith's, specifically his final ''Cubi'' series of monumental geometric sculptures made of stainless-steel cubes and prisms. Certainly Mr. Smith opened up a space for abstract sculpture in which Mr. Shapiro works. But Mr. Shapiro is very much his own artist, with his own style and set of aesthetic concerns, chief among them the striving for a sense of compositional balance between opposites. His sculptures are compact yet fluidly elegant; rapturously open yet contained; full of life yet inert; majestic yet humble. Several seem to defy gravity, with the arrangements of the cubes, prisms and rectangles surging into the air (left, ''Untitled,'' 2005-7). The works can also be brightly colored or lovingly hand-finished, the surface of the bronze sculptures made to resemble wood. They are like scaffolding crossed with a bouquet of flowers.

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"The echo of gunfire that accompanied two nights of rioting in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel this week has subsided, and now it is the relentless throbbing of police helicopters and the probing searchlights that keep residents awake. ''I feel safer for having all those cops on the streets and the helicopter at night making sure the kids are not planning more riots, but it sure is hard to live like this,'' said Nadège Tanier, a 40-year-old mother of two. She is among many locals trying to make do with an undeclared state of emergency. There is no curfew, but few people go out after dark when police officers move in. In interviews with residents, it became plain that there was little sympathy for the rioters. ''I don't like the way the police are treating the kids sometimes, and I know they do not have many economic opportunities, but there is no excuse for the violence and the destruction,'' said Nora Hemmal, a Moroccan immigrant who had hoped to enroll her daughter in a nursery that the rioters destroyed. ''Most of us are just caught in the middle.''"

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"SCHEETZ--Dr. Jane Overmeyer passed away peacefully and in comfort at the home of her son and his family in Greenwich on November 27, at the age of 75. She had battled lung and brain cancer for the better part of the year. She successfully struggled to survive and spend a final Thanksgiving with her entire family. She enjoyed Thanksgiving with her daughter, Mary Zehnle, and her husband, Tom, their two children Madeleine (11) and Nicky (6) and with her son, Ed, his wife Marianne and their two children Alexander (14) and Victoria (12). Jane was born in 1932 in Columbia, PA to Mary and Henry Overmeyer. She grew up in this small town in Amish Country. From there, she went to Penn State University and was one of the few women in the pre-med program there. She met her future husband, Walter, there. Walt and Jane were married in 1955. Both graduated from Temple Medical School in Philadelphia. Jane was a general practitioner but specialized in Bacteriology and Pathology. Walter entered the Army as a surgeon. While living in Honolulu, they had two children: Walter Edward (Ed) born January 11, 1965 and Mary Alice born April 5, 1966. After having the children, Jane devoted herself to raising them and became a homemaker. She maintained her license to practice medicine her entire life up to her death. The family settled in Potomac, Maryland, outside of Washington, DC. Jane's devotion to her family and her children were her proudest accomplishment. Her brilliance and wit was transferred to her children. Ed graduated from Princeton and became a successful real estate investor and now lives in Greenwich and New York. Mary graduated from Dickinson College and Catholic University Law School. Mary and Jane remained best friends and visited virtually everyday. Jane enjoyed watching her four grandchildren grow older. They adored her and enjoyed spending every moment they could with her. Jane was a movie buff with an incredible grasp of trivia. She kept her mind sharp reading, maintaining her medical degree, and mastering crossword puzzles. She often visited her family and enjoyed traveling with them to Hawaii, the Bahamas and other warm places. She faced a very difficult illness with courage and strength. Living with Ed's family in Greenwich she got to know Alex and Victoria even better prior to her death. Jane had a special fondness for Marianne, her daughterin-law, and Marianne was her primary companion and caregiver during her final six months. Jane will be missed enormously by her children Ed and Mary, their spouses, Marianne and Tom, and by her grandchildren, Alex, Victoria, Madeleine and Nicky. Mom, we love you very much and are happy you are in heaven with your parents and other close relatives. A memorial service will be held Saturday December 1st at Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church, 121 South Second Street, Columbia, PA 17512 (717) 684-7070.

2007-11-30T00:00:00Z,"'JOEL SHAPIRO: NEW SCULPTURE' Joel Shapiro's latest show is exquisite: a focused, perfect arrangement of just under a dozen sculptures filling Pace Wildenstein in Chelsea. This may well be the artist's best effort in years. The work may look old-fashioned to some, with its attention to relationships between abstraction and representation, its choice of weighty materials (wood and bronze) and its heroic scale. The pieces may even be reminiscent of David Smith's, specifically his final ''Cubi'' series of monumental geometric sculptures made of stainless-steel cubes and prisms. Certainly Mr. Smith opened up a space for abstract sculpture in which Mr. Shapiro works. But Mr. Shapiro is very much his own artist, with his own style and set of aesthetic concerns, chief among them the striving for a sense of compositional balance between opposites. His sculptures are compact yet fluidly elegant; rapturously open yet contained; full of life yet inert; majestic yet humble. Several seem to defy gravity, with the arrangements of the cubes, prisms and rectangles surging into the air (left, ''Untitled,'' 2005-7). The works can also be brightly colored or lovingly hand-finished, the surface of the bronze sculptures made to resemble wood. They are like scaffolding crossed with a bouquet of flowers.

Tranghese recalled that four years ago this weekend, Syracuse beat Boston College to put Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl. (The Panthers were blown out by Urban Meyer's undefeated Utah team.)

2007-12-01T00:00:00Z,"The six young actors and actresses who helped make ''High School Musical'' and ''High School Musical 2'' the most popular movies on the Disney Channel reached an agreement with Walt Disney Studios to star in a feature film based on the franchise, a Disney executive said yesterday. The executive, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because the company is not yet ready to make a formal announcement, said that five cast members -- Vanessa Hudgens,Ashley Tisdale, Corbin Bleu, Lucas Grabeel and Monique Coleman -- have signed contracts to appear in the film, which has the working title ''High School Musical 3'' and is scheduled to have its premiere next fall. The sixth, Zac Efron, who had a major role in the film ''Hairspray'' earlier this year, has committed to return but still has to sign a contract, the executive said. Mr. Efron's salary, the highest of the six, would be in excess of $3 million, the executive said. The movie will be directed and choreographed by Kenny Ortega, who was in charge of the first two productions, and will be set during the characters' senior year. Disney will also use the movie to introduce a secondary cast, who will star in future ''High School Musical'' television movies. The question of whether to include Ms. Hudgens had been extensively debated within Disney because she acknowledged in September that she was the nude woman in a photograph circulating widely on the Internet. She has since apologized to her fans."

2007-12-01T00:00:00Z,"A BID TO EASE CREDIT IN EUROPE The European Central Bank said that it would extend a lending deadline in December to help the banking system through a period of unusually tight credit at the end of the year. The action represents a renewed effort by the bank to calm a lending system that had showed signs of returning to normal recently but now appears nearly as nervous as during the summer days when the global credit turmoil began. The bank's normal midmonth lending, which typically has a maturity of a single week, will be extended in December so that loans are not due until Jan. 4. ''In this operation, the E.C.B. will aim to satisfy the banking sector's liquidity needs for the entire two-week period,'' the bank said in a statement."

(HBO) ALPHA DOG (2006) In 2000, a 20-year-old Los Angeles marijuana dealer named Jesse James Hollywood kidnapped, partied with and then ordered the murder of the 15-year-old half-brother of a client who owed him $1,200, prosecutors say. After that he was on the F.B.I.'s most-wanted list for five years until his arrest in Brazil in 2005. In this retelling by Nick Cassavetes, Emile Hirsch plays Johnny Truelove, the dim-bulb mastermind; Bruce Willis is his dad; and Justin Timberlake is Johnny's best friend.

But don't expect this self-described ''art tranny'' to be impressed by designer labels. He prefers to have his wardrobe custom-made. (For a summer course he taught at Central St. Martins, the students had five weeks to make him an outfit; he bought the ones he liked the best.) Perry, whose work ranges from ceramics to graphic novels, is currently designing a fabric for the English company Liberty; curating a show for the Arts Council England, ''Unpopular Culture''; and crafting a medal for the British Museum that he promises will be anything but noble. Despite his own penchant for baby-doll dresses and ruffled socks, he says: ''I am terribly sick of the infantilization of everyday life. Whatever happened to things being subversive, slow and complex?''"
2007-12-02T11:33:27Z,"As a child growing up in San Francisco, the multimedia artist Slater Bradley was obsessed with whom he wanted to be. ''I think it's something we all do when we're really young,'' he says. This search for identity still lingers in his work. ''Doppelgänger Trilogy,'' his 2004 lo-fi video series, showed his ''veritable double,'' Benjamin Brock, dressed as cultural icons from Bradley's youth like Kurt Cobain and Michael Jackson. ''I think the 'Doppelgänger' piece was practically begging for YouTube to exist,'' Bradley says. He is now interested in moving toward sculpture but is aware that his alter ego won't stop haunting him anytime soon: ''I have had about 29 solo shows, but people mostly know me by that piece.''"
2007-12-02T11:31:10Z,"Their his-and-his bespoke suits have made them two of the most recognizable peacocks in the art world. But unlike their perfectly tailored demeanor, the work of the London artists Gilbert and George is a messier affair. Often the stars of their own pieces, the pair have explored taboo subject matter like bodily fluids and skinhead subcultures in their photography and performance art. (An image from their 2005 series ''Ginkgo Pictures'' shows them morphing into a sort of two-headed monster.) A retrospective of their work was shown this year at the Tate Modern and is making its way to the Brooklyn Museum in October 2008. Much like their sartorial habits, their work appears timeless."

Blake Lively, the actress who plays Serena, finds that in terms of fashion, life and art imitate each other. ''She does have a strong sense of style, and I like to think mine is a little bit like hers,'' said Ms. Lively, 20, who often orders pieces directly from the designers she wears on the show. ''I like the urban, chic Kate Moss look and the ladylike Audrey Hepburn look as well.''"

2007-12-02T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Audiophile gear has always been a niche market -- as has classical music in general. But the ascendance of portable, downloadable music is not necessarily at odds with the audiophile ethos, which is a devotion to sonic authenticity with the goal of maximizing the enjoyment of recordings. IPods and similar devices are not limited to the sound quality inherent to the lowly MP3 file. If the user chooses, a higher-resolution format can be opted for when, for example, someone copies a CD he owns onto his iPod. And some classical music organizations that sell their material online know that sound quality matters. For example, the Philadelphia Orchestra Web site has downloads available as MP3 files or in the CD-quality FLAC format. It's no harder ''to be an audiophile in an iPod world'' than it is to be a Angela Gheorghiu fan in a Christina Aguilera world."

After more than 20 years of working in magazines, I still find it exciting scanning the newsstand for a good cover or a new title. Sharing T with readers of The New York Times has been an incredible pleasure, like inviting you to my house for dinner and a great bottle of wine. In these past three years, we have tried to be good hosts, serving up memorable images and great stories that whet your appetite for the culture: these days a fusion of fashion, art, design, film and music -- or as Jean Baudrillard might have said, a total entertainment world. We have also defied the prevailing wisdom that a magazine cannot address a large audience without sacrificing quality and elegance. With this issue, T goes global, as part of The International Herald Tribune, and also goes online. Just by logging on to nytimes.com/tmagazine, an even larger audience can enjoy our pages. But pages are not part of the virtual world, and that's a challenge. Much of what you see on the Web is visually unpleasant, busy and clunky. How could we make the virtual experience as sensual as the written one? We've worked on that task for months, and now you can judge the results. What we've attempted to create is a total immersive experience. Not just a place to go for information, though surely there's plenty of that, but also a place where you can be seduced by an image, a story and those special qualities that the Web can deliver: sound and movement. On our Web site, you will find everything that appears in our magazine, and much more: videos by artists and filmmakers, original interactive features and The Moment, a blog full of style discoveries, news and T's trademark wit, updated at least five times a day. Just as T has been editing the best in contemporary culture -- in fashion, art, design and travel -- T online will be your way to experience the best of the Web, put together by the same people we hope you already trust."

BEHIND THE NEWS The riots erupted in Villiers-le-Bel, about 12 miles from Paris, after two teenagers on a motorbike died in a collision with a police car. The clashes echoed on a smaller scale the uprisings that swept Paris's lower-class suburbs for three weeks in 2005. Some 1,000 riot police restored order by midweek but tensions remained.

But the Grammy-nominated producer Brian Burton, right, who is also known as Danger Mouse and half of the alt-pop duo Gnarls Barkley, thinks a temporary setup keeps him most creative. ''I change spaces all the time,'' he said. ''Every four or five months.'' He said that he has always moved around a lot, so the idea of being unsettled ''kind of creeps into relaxing me when I work.'' But his current studio in Los Angeles still bears some personal touches, like a boxing-themed bathroom and a wall plastered with quirky images and cryptic notes to himself. ''Sometimes I stare at things on the wall when I'm getting tired, in the hopes that they'll make more sense to me when I wake up,'' he said. ''Some people think it's weird, but that's the way I work.''"

2007-12-02T00:00:00Z,"CAVALLARO--Rosina Rosina Cavallaro passed away on October 29, 2007 at the age of 96. She was a New York City school teacher for nearly 40 years and a devoted sister and aunt. As many first generation immigrants Rosina acheived the American dream. Rosina was born in an East Harlem tenement in 1911 shortly after her parents arrived from Italy. Before WWI, her parents brought Rosina to Italy for a visit. After the outbreak of the War, her father was drafted into the Italian Army. The family was unable to return to the U.S. until 1921. At age 10, unable to speak English, Rosina entered the NYC Public Schools. She progressed rapidly to graduate with honors. After High School graduation, rosina entered Hunter College and again graduated with honors. She began her long teaching career as a substitute teacher and, in 1939, obtained a permanent teaching position in the New York City School System as a High School teacher of Italian, French and Spanish. Early in her career, Rosina attended Columbia University Teacher's College at night and received a Masters Degree in Romance languages. Rosina taught in a number of NYC High Schools but spent most of her career at the Evander Childs High School in the Bronx. She was beloved and endeared by many colleagues and students. After her retirement in 1973, many who knew her maintained contact until the last years of her life. Rosina was a life long resident of the Bronx, living in the family home on Morrison Avenue, in Parkchester and, in later years, Fort Schuyler House in Throgs Neck. Rosina had many scholarly and cultural interests. She was a generous donor to religious and social organizations during her life. Rosina was an active member of the Casa Italiana and The American Association of Italian Teachers. She was an avid opera fan and held subscription seats to the New York City Metropolitan Opera for more than two decades. She toured Europe and the U.S. frequently. Rosina is survived by her brother Salvatore and his wife Claire Cavallaro of Glen Head, NY; nieces Sahli Cavallaro of Albany, NY, Claire Cavallaro of Fullerton, CA, Mary Waddle of New Rochelle, NY, Angela Merindino of Sommers, NY, nephew Michael Cavallaro of Sleepy Hollow, NY; greatnephews Paul Waddle of Katonah, NY, Anthony Waddle of Lake Worth, FL, William Caplenor of Northridge, CA; and great-greatnieces and nephews Joseph, Enrico and Marisa."

2007-12-03T18:23:26Z,"""The Education of Henry Adams"" is not really an autobiography. As the author himself confesses several dozen pages from the end, it is the modern omega to the medieval alpha (his book ""Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres"") in his project to contrast long-ago cohesion with latter-day multiplicity. ""The Education"" is a treatise, an elegant, patrician apogee to the fine American tradition of cranks putting forth literary explanations for the whole universe, of which their own country is a strangely exceptional precinct. Adams's ""Dynamic Theory of History,"" developed during a decade in which he was also playing with magnets and seeking revelation in the statistics of coal production, proceeds from a late-life awareness of himself a ""a conscious ball of vibrating motions, traversed in every direction by infinite lines of rotation or vibration."" His discovery that, as of 1900, the world would ""not be a unity but a multiple"" freed him to write a memoir whose own ever-increasing entropy could be rationalized as a shape to suit the times."

We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. A nationally recognized constitutional and civil rights lawyer, Benson served as the ACLU's executive director in Ohio from 1969-1986. His distinguished career in litigation and advocacy included presenting a winning argument before the U.S. Supreme Court in Capital Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette. Benson, acting as an ACLU volunteer attorney, successfully challenged the State's refusal to permit the Ku Klux Klan to erect a cross next to a menorah on the grounds of the Statehouse, thus infringing upon the Klan's right to freedom of expression. He was perhaps most proud of his work on the Kent State University shootings litigation. Under his leadership, the case, entitled Krause v. Rhodes, reached a settlement on behalf of the students who were killed or injured on May 4, 1970 at Kent State. During his seventeen years as ACLU executive director, Wolman became well known as an articulate advocate of individual rights. Under his tutelage, the ACLU received the Gold Medal Award of the Freedoms Foundation for developing the Ohio Mock Trial Program of law related education in the state's high schools. He served on the National Advisory Council of the ACLU and as a member of the ACLU's national, state and local boards of directors. After leaving the ACLU, Benson served as counsel to the law firm Moots, Cope & Stanton, and later formed his own firm, Wolman, Genshaft & Gellman, both in Columbus. Benson had been serving as executive director of the Equal Justice Foundation in Columbus at the time of his death. Benson was known for his wit, eloquence, and passion for civil liberties. He will be missed by the many ACLU members whom he recruited, mentored, supported and collaborated with over the years."

Mr. Julius Gantman, who served as a senior executive and member of the Board of Directors of Public Service Mutual Insurance Company died at his home in Westchester on Sunday, December 2, 2007. He was 97. At the time of his death, Mr. Gantman was one of three senior members of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors having been named to the Board in November 1977. Mr. Gantman joined Public Service Mutual Insurance Company's legal department in 1942 and served in various leadership positions until his retirement from active employment in May 1980. ''Julie will always remain an important and colorful part of our Magna Carta history and will be sorely missed by all,'' said Andrew L. Furgatch, Chairman of the Board of Public Service Mutual Insurance Company, an affiliate of Magna Carta Companies. Mr. Gantman earned both his undergraduate degree and bachelor of laws degree from St. John's University in New York. The Magna Carta Foundation established the Julius Gantman Scholarship Fund at St. John's University School of Risk Management, Insurance and Actuarial Science (formerly the College of Insurance) in 2003.

2007-12-05T00:00:00Z,"WOLMAN--Benson. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Board of Directors mourn the death of Benson Wolman, a longtime civil rights lawyer and a champion of the poor. Wolman was a former member of the ACLU National Board and past executive director of the Ohio affiliate. Wolman died on Friday. He was 71 years old. Wolman's heart was always with the ACLU and he remained a volunteer attorney even after he left the organization and went into private practice. It was in that role that he won Pinette v. Capitol Square Review Board, a major Supreme Court free speech decision in 1995. Wolman joined the ACLU in the 1950s to defend First Amendment rights and due process, and stayed on to help the organization as it fought on other fronts, including leading the Ohio affiliate from 1969 to 1986. His work during that period on behalf of the Kent State University shooting victims was a great source of pride for him. Under his leadership, the case, entitled Krause v. Rhodes, reached a settlement on behalf of the students who were killed or injured when the National Guard opened fire on them during a May 1970 college protest. Although his base was in Columbus, Wolman's influence extended far beyond Ohio. In 2005 he became chief executive and general counsel of the Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit agency that represents people disenfranchised by the legal system."
