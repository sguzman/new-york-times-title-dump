While still a student at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, she traveled to China to teach in a government school, leaving as the Japanese-Chinese fighting approached the town. Returning to the United States, she completed her B.A. at Carleton and went on to earn an M.A. in International Relations from the University of Chicago and an M.S. in Education from Madison College in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In 1939 she married Haldore Hanson. Together they spent more than 25 years living in Asia. Africa, and South America. Haldore's work in economic development, primarily with the Ford Foundation, took them to Burma, Iran, Pakistan, West Africa, and Mexico. Berni's focus in these countries was on promoting traditional handicrafts. She was involved in developing rural cooperatives to support local artisans and arranging venues in urban areas for artisans to demonstrate and sell their work. She is the author of a book, From the Distaff Side: Fifty Years Around the Third World, describing her experiences.

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Jake Kasdan, the writer and director of ''The TV Set,'' was also among the creators of ''Freaks and Geeks,'' one of those shows that drew a fatally small but unusually ardent audience. It may have been too smart for the medium, and Mr. Kasdan is thus perhaps ideally suited to making a knowing, behind-the-scenes sendup of network television. He has seen how it works and lived to tell the tale. Show business satire is a tricky genre, at once too easy and too hard. The manners and mores of the Hollywood executive class -- the new-age management lingo, the smiling hostility, the mix of forced casualness and status anxiety -- all of this pretty much makes fun of itself. So do the neuroses of the various ''creatives,'' as actors, writers and directors are sometimes called."

This ''Sopranos'' is not by Mr. Chase; it does not appear on HBO and cannot be described as pensive, brooding or austere. Instead it is hyperglib, antic and rendered at an auctioneer's pace."

'TRANSFIGURES' Previews start today. Opens on April 16. Created from sources including the writings of Joan of Arc, scientific journals and Post-it notes from the desks of corporate secretaries, this new show examines the Jerusalem Syndrome (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'ESSENTIAL SELF-DEFENSE' Adam Rapp's new play is a quirky love story about a wholesome but anxious girl (the charming Heather Goldenhersh) and an automaton with a beating heart and a big vocabulary (Paul Sparks, impressively affectless). Dark, zany, entirely mannered and mostly empty (2:15). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'FUGUE' ''Mary Smith'' is found wandering the streets of Chicago, suffering from amnesia. A young psychiatrist, who has his own demons, is consulted, and the process of treatment and Mary's memories in flashback are the action of ''Fugue,'' Lee Thuna's unrewarding play, directed by the Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey (2:15). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'LA MAGNANI' Theresa Gambacorta reincarnates the Italian film star in this one-woman show, which reveals her to be more irritating than interesting -- loud and self-absorbed. Ms. Gambacorta does, however, get some pathos out of her relationship to her son, who had polio (1:10). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noel Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Spectacles 'RINGLING BROTHERS AND BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS' An eye- and earful (2:10). Madison Square Garden, (212) 307-7171. (Lawrence Van Gelder) Last Chance 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of José Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'CHICKEN' Michael Batistick's new play about cockfighting and emasculation could benefit from subtler metaphors but manages to touch us gently even as it deploys a heavy hammer. E J Carroll, Michael Imperioli and his ''Sopranos'' cast mate Sharon Angela give fine performances as struggling urban nobodies (1:45). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'DID YOU USED TO BE R. D. LAING?' This sweet, nostalgic solo show explores the life and work of the controversial Scottish psychiatrist -- an international celebrity and countercultural guru in the 1960s -- from the perspective of a genial admirer. It's well acted and empathetic but a bit too pleasantly tranquil to bring such a prickly and passionately disputed figure into full focus (1:30). The American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Kalb) 'THE EXILES' Theodora Skipitares's rendering, with life-size puppets, music and video, of the story of Orestes, adapted from Euripides but inspired by Sartre. A short and rather slight play that continues the mining of the Trojan War for contemporary equivalents by the conceiver and director of last season's Trilogy (1:00). La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Moore) 'MEN OF STEEL' This darkly comic twist on superheroes is a loony, guilty pleasure (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' An adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, updated to 1990s Harlem, tests the limits of credibility (1:40). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis) * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'AMERICAN CANNIBAL' (No rating, 91 minutes) Illustrating the premise that if you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas, the documentary about a failed reality television series is absorbing in the same sick way as the lowest examples of the genre it examines. (Stephen Holden) * 'BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON' (R, 92 minutes) Scott Glosserman's mockumentary about a celebrity-seeking serial killer is sustained by rapier-sharp observations and a firmer grasp of tone than that in many more generously financed projects. The movie subtly prods at the sick dance between the news media and über-criminals without belaboring its point or lowering its tone. If Christopher Guest ever turned his attention to psycho killers instead of dog breeders, this is exactly the sort of movie he would make. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Catsoulis) * 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller directed by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofor, among others. , as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis) 'COLOR ME KUBRICK' (No rating, 90 minutes) If it doesn't add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, the fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame. (Holden) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'THE HAWK IS DYING' (No rating, 106 minutes) In this painfully earnest backwoods tale from the director Julian Goldberger, Paul Giamatti plays George Gattling, a dispirited auto upholsterer with a passion for falconry. Set in Central Florida and based on the book by Harry Crews, ''The Hawk Is Dying'' is a dreary study of male angst groaning beneath the weight of its own symbolism. Not since Ken Loach's ''Kes'' has a bird of prey carried so much dramatic responsibility. (Catsoulis) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) 'I THINK I LOVE MY WIFE' (R, 94 minutes) An unusually smart and brisk comedy of marital frustration and sexual temptation, based on Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon,'' with Chris Rock (who directed and is co-author of the script) as a Manhattan investment banker distracted by the charms of a bombshell played by the wonderful Kerry Washington. (A. O. Scott) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) 'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz) * 'OFFSIDE' (PG, 93 minutes, in Persian) The Iranian director Jafar Panahi follows a group of young woman into a Tehran soccer stadium, where they have come to see their nation's team compete for a spot in the World Cup. Instead they are arrested -- women are forbidden to attend sporting events in Iran -- and their predicament yields comedy as well as a trenchant critique of gender politics in the Islamic Republic. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'SACCO AND VANZETTI' (No rating, 81 minutes) This feature filmmaking debut by Peter Miller, a PBS veteran, hews to standard television documentary format: archival photographs and talking heads. But the movie's meat-and-potatoes style seems less a failure of imagination than a means of putting in the foreground its subject matter: the still-controversial tale of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, Italian immigrants and outspoken anarchists charged with the 1920 robbery of a Massachusetts shoe factory and the murder of two of its employees. A good film on a great subject. (Seitz) 'SHOOTER' (R, 126 minutes) Muscles bulge and heads explode in this thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom. Antoine Fuqua directs, and Mark Wahlberg entertains, with and without his shirt. (Dargis) * 'U-CARMEN' (No rating, 120 minutes, in Xhosa) Winner of the top award at the 2005 Berlin Film Festival, ''U-Carmen'' pushes against every expectation you would normally bring to a movie version of Bizet's opera. It relocates the tale's doomed romantic triangle to Khayelitsha, an industrial community near Cape Town, South Africa; sets the action in and around a cigarette factory; and translates its libretto into Xhosa, a regional language distinguished by its abundance of pops and clicks. For the most part, the film's action is intentionally plain, always acknowledging its physical environment, which can be frustrating when the melodies soar. But the music still pierces, the blood still flows, and the overall conception is so original that even when the movie falters in the moment, it dazzles in the memory. (Seitz) Film Series 'BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ' (Tuesday through April 15) Rainer Werner Fassbinder made this 13-part adaptation of the grueling social realist novel by Alfred Doblin for West German television in 1980, but because the film was shot on 16 millimeter, it has been in fragile condition and out of sight for many years. But now the Fassbinder Foundation, with the support of the Museum of Modern Art, has completed a restoration, transferring the original 16-millimeter negative to 35 millimeter. Gunter Lamprecht stars as the downtrodden hero, a Weimer everyman struggling to keep his stomach full and his dignity intact. Parts 1 through 3 will be shown on Tuesday; 4 through 7 on Wednesday; 8 through 11 on Thursday; and 12, 13 and the epilogue on April 13. (The film will also be repeated in two parts on April 14 and 15.) This screening is part of a three-week series of Fassbinder films from MoMA's collection, which this week will include ''Despair'' (tonight), ''The Merchant of Four Seasons'' (tomorrow), ''Jail Bait'' (tomorrow) and ''Whity'' (Sunday). On Monday, Juliane Lorenz, Fassbinder's longtime editor, will introduce two documentaries, ''Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz: Notes on the Restoration'' and ''A Mega Movie and Its Story.'' Mr. Lamprecht and one of his co-stars, Barbara Sukowa, are expected to attend. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) FARES TO REMEMBER: TAXI '07 (Today through Sunday) The IFC Center celebrates the 100th anniversary of the taxi in New York City with a month of cab-centric movies. This Friday and Sunday at noon, Harold Lloyd stars in the silent comedy ''Speedy,'' in which one of his duties as a New York cabbie is getting Babe Ruth to the stadium on time. At midnight on Friday and Saturday, Robert De Niro plays a less accommodating chauffeur in Martin Scorsese's dark, expressionist ''Taxi Driver'' (1976). IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) THE REAL EDIE SEDGWICK (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image concludes a survey of the film work of this Warhol superstar, society figure and all-around study in self-destructiveness with several rarely shown Warhol films, including ''Kitchen,'' ''Restaurant,'' ''Afternoon'' (made from outtakes from ''Chelsea Girls''), ''Beauty #2'' and ''Horse,'' all from 1965. There's also a pair of non-Warhol efforts: ''Poem Posters,'' a 1967 documentary by Charles Henri Ford in which Sedgwick appears among the downtown celebrities at an art opening, and the 1972 ''Ciao, Manhattan,'' a semi-autobiographical feature completed just weeks before Sedgwick's death. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, PUSSYCAT DOLLS, DANITY KANE (Tomorrow) Frau Farbissina of the ''Austin Powers'' movies said it best: ''Send in the Fembots!'' Ms. Aguilera may have the most virtuosic voice of her generation of bubble-gum pop stars, but as she showed with her endless melismatic protraction of James Brown's ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World'' at the Grammys in February, she can sometimes seem like a singing robot gone berserk. Her tour includes a hit burlesque girl group (the Pussycat Dolls) and an imitation hit burlesque girl group (Danity Kane). At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300, nassaucoliseum.com; $55 to $95. (Ben Sisario) * LILY ALLEN, THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Wednesday) A 21-year-old British singer with deceptively sweet, ska-infused electro-pop songs, Ms. Allen is at her best when snarkily putting down disagreeable suitors. ''Smile,'' a No. 1 hit in England, is pure schadenfreude, and ''Knock 'Em Out'' a catalog of snappy answers to bad pickup lines: ''I've got herpes. No, I've got syphilis.'' The Bird and the Bee, a well-dressed duo from Los Angeles, toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums. This show inaugurates the newly renamed Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza. At 8:40 p.m., 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Tonight through Sunday) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater, ending this weekend. At 8, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $54.99 to $94.99. (Sisario) BLUE CHEER, AN ALBATROSS (Tomorrow) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960s and early '70s, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the band sound like cave men discovering fire. An Albatross, from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., shrieks its way through dizzying but lighthearted prog-hardcore songs that borrow something from Captain Beefheart. At 8 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday and Monday) Elegant, witty and touching, this classically trained jazz pianist and singer, now 82, is in her prime: the female counterpart of Bobby Short. Sunday at 2 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $58 on Sunday, with brunch at noon; $40 on Monday, with a $20 minimum. (Stephen Holden) CÉU (Monday and Tuesday) With an easy, dragging beat, bossa nova becomes something like light dub in the lithe and playful songs of Céu, a young woman from São Paulo who is rising fast in the Brazilian circuit. Monday at 9:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario) * COLD WAR KIDS, TOKYO POLICE CLUB (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday nights) The craggy guitars and piano, elliptical songwriting and verge-of-a-breakdown vocals of Cold War Kids, from Long Beach, Calif., may be par for the indie-rock course. But if the band's three sold-out shows this week at the Bowery Ballroom are any indication, it is still basking in the microfame bestowed over the last year by zealous bloggers. Tonight and tomorrow night, Cold War Kids play with Tokyo Police Club, a Canadian group that spikes Strokes-like songs with noisy petulance. At 9, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com. Tokyo Police Club also plays Monday at 10 p.m. at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) JOÃO DONATO (Tonight) Mr. Donato is one of the great bossa nova composers of the late-'50s generation, and probably the one most influenced by American jazz; his performances these days are nostalgic and sometimes anarchically funny. At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $30. (Ben Ratliff) * IGGY AND THE STOOGES (Monday) Suffice it to say that ''The Weirdness'' (Virgin), the first Stooges album in 34 years, is not likely to become a classic. But as with every one of Iggy Pop's many mediocre solo albums over the years, any excuse to keep him on the road is worthwhile. Even nearing 60, he remains an inspirationally feral performer, and on past tours the reunited Stooges have ably summoned some of the raw, menacing groove that made them one of the primary godfathers of punk rock. With Sistas in the Pit. At 7 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; $39.50 to $59.50. (Sisario) JUNIOR BOYS (Wednesday) When dance music goes sad: squiggly, awkward beats and droopy keyboards surround the forlorn vocals of this Canadian electronic group, who sing about missed birthdays and phones that don't ring. With San Serac and TigerCity. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) KAISER CHIEFS, WALKMEN (Thursday) Gracefully but not always excitingly, the Kaiser Chiefs, from Leeds, England, mingle the spunky minimalism of XTC-vintage post-punk with the ballad-friendly melodicism of '90s Britpop. The Walkmen, from New York, play exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. With the Annuals. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $31 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) KIKI AND HERB (Sunday) A few years ago this brilliantly perverse cabaret duo played their farewell show at Carnegie Hall. Then came a run on Broadway. And some late-night gigs at Joe's Pub. And the inimitable Christmas show. (Highlight: a medley of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ''Frosty the Snowman.'') Kiki and Herb can't stay away from the stage, and New York is the better for it. At 11:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $20. (Sisario) * KLAXONS (Tuesday) This British trio's eerie rave-punk is punctuated by the peal of air-raid sirens and paranoid, shouted lyrics that allude to William S. Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon. How the band manages to cram in such fear and loathing and still make exhilarating, danceable grooves is what makes it fascinating. With Bonde do Role, a Brazilian baile-funk group that makes silly but contagiously high-energy electronic pastiches. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) SONDRE LERCHE (Tomorrow) A 24-year-old Norwegian with a kind tenor and a light touch, Mr. Lerche plays elegant, melodically rich but sometimes overly coy folk-pop. With Willy Mason and Thomas Dybdahl. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Sisario) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO HALL AND OATES (Thursday) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Hall and Oates, whose mega-selling soul-pop ranged from the sublime (''She's Gone'') to the farcical (''Portable Radio''). At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) LOW; LONEY, DEAR (Tonight) With exquisite care, Low, from Duluth, Minn., featuring the husband-and-wife team of Alan Sparhawk on guitar and Mimi Parker on vocals, and Matt Livingston on bass, creates hushed, stark songs on a vast sonic scale. Loney, Dear, led by the Swedish songwriter Emil Svanangen, plays placid folk-pop decorated with endearing, '60s-style harmonies. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario) PARTS AND LABOR (Tonight) This squally Brooklyn three-piece ably pulls off the tricky task of being both anarchic and anthemic. With Big Bear, Gowns and Alex Delivery. At 8:30, Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $10. (Sisario) PEEPING TOM (Monday) The latest project of Mike Patton, the naughty boy of heavy metal turned naughty boy of the avant-garde. The gimmick here is creepy lounge and trip-hop, with various collaborators in on the joke. For this show the guests are Dan the Automator, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto and the rapper Pigeon John. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario) PRETTY RICKY (Tomorrow) This R&B boy band from Miami has hit the top of the charts with amorous crooning -- and some rapping -- that drops flirtatious pretense in pursuit of the girl and cuts right to the chase: ''Can I put a little peer pressure on ya?'' At 7 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $29.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario) RASPUTINA (Tonight) Rasputina is a charmingly improbable project: part Marie Antoinette, part metal. Three women who are cellists in corsets (as well as a drummer) sing about Transylvanian concubines as their music seesaws between elaborate chamber-music counterpoint and grunting hard-rock chords, complete with distortion. With the Bowmans. At 9, Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $20.50. (Jon Pareles) DIANA ROSS (Tonight) In her guest performance on ''American Idol'' last month, Ms. Ross showed that at 63 she remains every bit the ''dreamgirl'': breezing her way through the Spiral Starecase song ''More Today Than Yesterday,'' she was smooth, cocky and in love with her own voice -- a true superstar. At 8, the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $59.50 to $149.50. (Sisario) MARTIN SEXTON (Tonight) This singer and songwriter can groan like an alternative rocker, slide like a soul man or leap up to a pearly falsetto. Singing about restlessness and love while he picks syncopations on his guitar, Mr. Sexton can turn an ordinary song into a jazzy showcase, and a good one into a transmission from the heart. With Jonah Smith. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $30. (Pareles) STONE SOUR, SHADOWS FALL, LACUNA COIL (Tonight) Stone Sour, featuring Corey Taylor of the horror-metal crew Slipknot, leads a strong bill of angry guitars and punishing drums. Slipknot is indiscriminate in its misanthropy, but in the poppier Stone Sour, Mr. Taylor chooses his targets more carefully, including some not-so-veiled political ones: ''We're more in danger than before you took power.'' At 7:20, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800 roselandballroom.com; $34. (Sisario) * KOKO TAYLOR (Tonight) For five decades Ms. Taylor, 71, has sung brawny, carnal blues like ''Wang Dang Doodle'' with a strength and swagger rivaling that of any man. After a health crisis a few years ago, she has returned with a new album, ''Old School'' (Alligator), in which she shows that her ego remains as strong as her voice: ''You don't want to tangle with me,'' she sings. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35. (Sisario) TEDDYBEARS (Monday) This Swedish band has one of the year's bigger head-scratchers with ''Punkrocker,'' a paranoid jaunt with new-wave synthesizers and a deadpan vocal by Iggy Pop that is being used in a Cadillac ad -- makes perfect sense, right? With Foreign Islands. At 7 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $14.50 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario) WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY (Tomorrow) The World/Inferno Friendship Society's ''red-eyed soul'' is a raucous mix of ska, punk and horn-driven retro R&B. With Paint It Black, the Vicious and Measure SA. At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $13. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. * JOHN ABERCROMBIE QUARTET (Wednesday and Thursday) The guitarist John Abercrombie has a new album, ''The Third Quartet'' (ECM), that captures the thoughtful chemistry of this group with the violinist Mark Feldman, the bassist Marc Johnson and the drummer Joey Baron. (Through April 14.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen) * ALL THAT JAZZ: NOW THAT'S HIP (Tuesday) This annual concert, sponsored by the HIP Health Plan of New York, invariably spotlights the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis with his working band. This edition, ''New Orleans Rising,'' also benefits from the inclusion of the pianist-singer Dr. John, with his rollicking swamp-funk band the Lower 911. At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $32.50 to $87.50.

(Chinen) DAVE ALLEN (Monday) Mr. Allen is a guitarist with a coolly modernistic sensibility, as he demonstrated on his last album, ''Untold Stories'' (Fresh Sound New Talent). Two musicians from the album, the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake and the drummer Mark Ferber, join him here. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10.

(Chinen) PETER BRÖTZMANN, MARINO PLIAKAS AND MICHAEL WERTMUELLER (Wednesday) Few modern saxophonists can sound as powerfully abrasive as Mr. Brötzmann, whose most recent album, ''Full Blast'' (Jazzwerkstatt), is a collaboration with Mr. Pliakas, a guitarist and bassist, and Mr. Wertmueller, a drummer. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12. (Chinen) * RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET / DAVID SÁNCHEZ QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Ravi Coltrane and David Sánchez are two of the more assertively creative tenor saxophonists to emerge within the jazz mainstream in the last dozen or so years, and each has a knack for organizing rhythmically sophisticated working bands. (Through April 15.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * DAVE DOUGLAS AND KEYSTONE (Thursday) On his recent album ''Keystone'' (Greenleaf), the trumpeter Dave Douglas imagines a vividly contemporary soundtrack to the silent films of Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle. The music sounds best in performance, thanks to a smartly thrashing electro-acoustic band with Marcus Strickland on tenor saxophone, Adam Benjamin on Fender Rhodes piano, Brad Jones on bass, DJ Olive on turntables and Gene Lake on drums. (Through April 15.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) SONNY FORTUNE TRIO (Tomorrow) Since the 1960s, countless saxophonists have adopted the methodology of John Coltrane, but few have captured his restless spirit. Mr. Fortune, the saxophonist of choice for the late Coltrane drummer Elvin Jones, is chief among them; he performs with the bassist David Williams and the drummer Neal Smith. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766, sistasplace.org; cover, $20.

At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $15.

(Chinen) PAT MARTINO (Tonight through Sunday) A powerfully proficient guitarist, Mr. Martino favors a brand of post-bop that has more than a little in common with the blistering fusion of his youth.

(Chinen) * THELONIOUS MONK 90TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) A premature celebration, perhaps -- Thelonious Monk was born in October -- but a thoughtfully programmed one, involving a pianist deeply familiar with Monkish expression (Kenny Barron) and a repertory band led by one of Monk's former drummers (Ben Riley's Monk Legacy Septet). As a bonus, the actor Rome Neal will revisit his role in ''Monk'' (the one-man play, not the television show). At 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $30, $27.50 for students.

At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $30. (Chinen) MISHA PIATIGORSKY (Wednesday) On his new album, ''Uncommon Circumstance'' (Mishamusic), the pianist Misha Piatigorsky plays original music informed both by classical and groove-based music, with impressive but sometimes airless results. He has an excellent rhythm section, though, in the bassist Hans Glawischnig and the drummer Ari Hoenig, who appear here. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'DIE ÄGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Tomorrow) With its convoluted libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and unevenly inspired score by Richard Strauss, this wry contemporary take on the Helen of Troy myth, has remained a rarity since its 1928 premiere. But the Metropolitan Opera's fancifully surreal new production by David Fielding, mounted for the soprano Deborah Voigt, makes a compelling case for this intriguing work, thanks to Mr. Voigt's vocally lustrous and affecting portrayal of the title role as well as the vibrant and insightful conducting of Fabio Luisi. The brilliant coloratura Diana Damrau is wonderful as the sorceress Aithra. The German tenor Torsten Kerl sings Menelas. This is the final performance of the season. At 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's swashbuckling verismo opera, in the Met's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role, a poet with libertarian fervor during the French Revolution. But in his honest and compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana as Maddalena and the powerful baritone Mark Delavan as Gérard are very strong. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $220 to $320 tomorrow, $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Tomorrow) Rossini's sleek, simple and lovely take on Sir Walter Scott is ending its run at the New York City Opera. Elena, the Donna in question, is sung by Alexandrina Pendatchanska. The two high-flying tenor parts are taken by Barry Banks as Uberto and Andrew Drost as Rodrigo. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Bernard Holland) 'CURLEW RIVER' (Thursday) Britten called his one-act opera ''Curlew River'' a church parable. Inspired by a Japanese Noh play, the work takes the form of a sacred ritual, with a procession of monks enacting a mystery play about a madwoman who crosses a river with a ferryman in search of her abducted son. The Japan Society offers a staging of this haunting and seldom-seen work, a co-production with the L'Opéra Rouen/Haute-Normandie directed by Yoshi Oida, starring the tenor Michael Bennett as the madwoman, with musical direction by David Stern. At 7:30 p.m., 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $52; $45 for members. (Tommasini) 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera joins a big week for Handel opera with the first ''Giulio Cesare'' of the season. David Daniels and Ruth Ann Swenson are in principal roles, and Harry Bicket conducts. At 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $110 to $320 tickets remaining tonight, $15 to $175 for Tuesday. (Holland) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) New principals take over the City Opera's current run of Puccini's inspired tearjerker. Shu-Ying Li is Cio-Cio-San and Christopher Jackson is Pinkerton. Atsushi Yamada is the new conductor. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Wednesday) The stylishly realistic production of Verdi's ''Traviata'' created by the soprano Renata Scotto for the New York City Opera returns to the repertory. Making her company debut as Violetta is the French soprano Anne-Sophie Duprels, who has won high praise for her portrayal of the role in London and other cities. The tenor Bruce Sledge sings Alfredo. George Manahan conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Monday) For spectacle and big music, the Franco Zeffirelli production at the Met of Puccini's final opera is hard to beat. For compelling leads, you might have to look elsewhere: Andrea Gruber sounded wobbly and thin on the first night of this revival, and Richard Margison effort-full, though he marshaled his forces for ''Nessun dorma.'' Only Hei-Kyung Hong's Liu, with her reliably floating pianos, was really worth the price of admission. But spectacle and size are evidently enough to keep tickets selling briskly for this one. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Monday and Wednesday) William Kentridge, the South African art-world star, is an animator, a draughtsman and a man of the theater. After a range of smaller-scale works -- the puppet operas ''Zeno at 4 a.m.'' and ''Il Ritorno di Ulisse in Patria'' were both seen at Lincoln Center in recent years -- he took on Mozart's final opera for the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Belgium in 2005. Set in a Victorian age of exploration, with antic animations, the resulting production (conducted by an assistant of René Jacobs, who led the original) comes to Brooklyn for four performances through next weekend. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $110. (Midgette) Classical Music 'ABSOLUTE ARABIAN NIGHTS' (Tomorrow) Conceived by Kristjan Jarvi, the adventurous young conductor who founded the hip Absolute Ensemble, and the Swiss-born composer Daniel Schnyder, ''Absolute Arabian Nights'' is, the presenters state, a classical, jazz and ethnic music fusion of the sights and spirit of the Middle East. This ensemble's guests for this timely program include Marcel Khalife on oud and vocals, Bachar Khalife on hand percussion and Bassam Saba on nay. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $37.50 and $40. (Tommasini) * BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) This floating concert hall, moored at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, is making the most of its intimate atmosphere by having the musicologist Maya Pritsker on hand tonight and tomorrow to discuss the music on the programs.

Tomorrow, the violinist Michael Vaiman and the pianist Dina Yoffe play sonatas by Mozart, Shostakovich and Schumann. On Sunday, the New York Chamber Soloists perform Bach's ''Musical Offering'' as well as Mozart's Adagio and Rondo in C minor (K. 617) and the premiere of Gerald Fried's ''Chess Game,'' a work inspired by ''Alice in Wonderland.''

Mozart's exquisite Clarinet Quintet and a Leclair sonata fill out the program. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org. $35 tonight and tomorrow; $40 on Sunday; $45 on Thursday. (Allan Kozinn) THOMAS BUCKNER (Thursday) The baritone Thomas Buckner, here presented by the World Music Institute as part of the Interpretations series (which he curates), has long been a champion of avant-garde music. He will perform new works for voice and various instruments, including William Duckworth's ''Their Song'' for baritone and piano. Petr Kotik conducts the New York premiere of Christian Wolff's ''37 Haiku'' for baritone, oboe, horn, viola and cello, and the world premiere of ''A People's History'' by R. Chris Dahlgren for baritone, flute, clarinet, percussion, piano, celeste, violin and cello. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $10; $7 for students. (Vivien Schweitzer) SARAH CHANG (Tuesday) Sarah Chang, a former prodigy who has matured into a gifted artist, and Ashley Wass, a pianist, play Beethoven's ''Kreutzer'' Sonata and Prokofiev's Violin Sonata No. 2. Sandwiched between these two extroverted works is the New York premiere of Richard Danielpour's introverted ''River of Light,'' written in memory of Isaac Stern. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to 79. (Schweitzer) COLLEGIUM VOCALE GENT (Sunday) Whatever your religious persuasions, for a music lover there is no better way to spend Easter Sunday than listening to the Collegium Vocale Gent under Philippe Herreweghe perform Bach's ''St. John Passion.'' The ensembles (both chorus and orchestra) are first-rate, the music breathtaking, the soloists (including Camilla Tilling and Christoph Prégardien as the Evangelist) reliable: superlatives fail us. Just go. At 3 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $60. (Midgette) CUTTING EDGE ENSEMBLE (Monday) The conductor and composer Victoria Bond is the host of a series of concerts that bring together music and other art forms -- in this case, weaving and digital art. Pamela Topham's ''Water Music,'' a tapestry inspired by the East Hampton landscape, will be paired with Libby Larsen's ''Slow Structures,'' a composition inspired by water as it freezes. Judith Shatin's ''Penelope's Song,'' for cello and electronics, uses the sounds of a weaver's loom. And Kenji Bunch's ''Crawl Space,'' ''Sarabande'' and ''The 3 G's'' will be accompanied by video of digital painting and animation. At 8 p.m., the Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $15; $10 for students.

He addresses himself here to Bach's Partita No. 5, Mozart's Rondo in A (K. 511), Brahms's Fantasies (Op. 116) and Debussy's Preludes, Book II. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $90. (Kozinn) * JERUSALEM STRING QUARTET (Thursday) This young ensemble played a memorable concert at the 92nd Street Y last season in which it framed a Brahms Piano Quintet with American and Israeli works. The group's program at Zankel Hall looks more cautious -- the repertory is Beethoven's Quartet in F (Op. 18, No. 1), Janacek's gritty ''Kreutzer Sonata'' Quartet, and Tchaikovsky's Quartet No. 1 -- but presumably these musicians play this works with the same electricity that enlivened their performance last year. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $42. (Kozinn) WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR AND HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Monday) Hot on the heels of their exploration of the songs of Hugo Wolf, Mr. Holzmair, a baritone, and Ms. Haselböck, a mezzo-soprano (both excellent Austrian singers), turn their attention to the songs of Franz Schreker, a major opera composer of the early 20th century whose music was branded ''degenerate'' by the Nazis. The event is offered in tandem with the American premiere of Schreker's 1910 opera, ''Der Ferne Klang,'' in a concert performance by the American Symphony Orchestra and Leon Botstein. At 8 p.m., Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300; acfny.com; free, but reservations are required.

(Holland) NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday and Thursday) Latin song has become a great passion among the many wide-ranging passions of Steven Blier, the polymathic co-founder, co-director, accompanist and speaker of the New York Festival of Song.

Michelle Areyzaga, Jeffrey Picon and Ricardo Herrera are the soloists. At 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $48.

For Mr. Oramo, however, another highlight is his compatriot Sibelius's Sixth Symphony: the rising star, who successfully succeeded Simon Rattle in Birmingham, is recording a complete Sibelius cycle. Wednesday at 6:45 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $60 for Wednesday, $28 to $94 for Thursday.

(Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AILEY II (Wednesday and Thursday) Alvin Ailey created a second, or junior, company in 1974, almost casually, as a way of working on new choreography. Ailey II is now a world-class troupe, filled with dancers who not only are good but also perform with a youthful hunger for their art, along with a reverence for dance that is a part of the mission of the company director, Sylvia Waters, whom Ailey himself chose to direct that first group. Now Ailey II is coming home, performing in the black-box theater that is part of the Ailey headquarters -- newer, grander and more gleaming than Ailey ever envisioned. The repertory will include new dances by Abdel Salaam, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Jessica Lang, along with Ailey's ''Streams'' and a chunk of Ailey highlights. (Through April 22.)

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this sprawling, international assembly of recent pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture far beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating, especially as a record of the way that feminism has gripped and jump-started the imaginations of women around the world. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School but one of its less dramatic painters, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin, rather than the metaphorical view held by Cole and other Hudson River artists that its representation ought to express God's sublimity. Obeying Ruskin's call for truth to nature, Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand's weaknesses -- repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists -- it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'FAMILY PICTURES,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents awkwardly posing against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VENICE AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural cross-currents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (See above.) (Smith) MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. Even in the contemporary art world the symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This new exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * MOMA: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * NEUE GALERIE: 'VAN GOGH AND EXPRESSIONISM,' through July 2. The Neue has, as usual, gathered a stellar roundup of Expressionist art. In one of the show's most exciting rooms, a third-floor gallery devoted mostly to self-portraits, two extraordinary van Goghs hang at opposite ends: ''Self-Portrait With Straw Hat'' (1887-88), from the Metropolitan Museum's collection, filled with energetic, radiating brushstrokes, and the National Gallery's vibrant self-portrait of the artist holding a palette and brushes, painted about a year later. The most compelling pairing in this room, though, is van Gogh's ''Bedroom'' from 1889, the second of three versions he painted of his room in Arles, with Egon Schiele's obvious homage, ''The Artist's Bedroom in Neulengbach,'' painted in 1911, in a darker palette and with a perspective tipped precariously toward the viewer. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Schwendener) WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbarán's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the pièce de résistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org (Glueck) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. He also sautéed a Polaroid of a Christmas tree in grease. The copy he sent to Robert Smithson, golden brown on the outside, is here too, and none too appetizing, I might add. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea JEAN SHIN: KEY PROMISES The idea is obvious, if you're as keen as this artist on recycling everyday objects: an installation using the word commands of countless computer keyboards to orchestrate a flow of suggested actions, desires and emotional states across four walls of a small gallery. From esc and shift to return and home. Art lite, perhaps, but expertly done. Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992, frederieketaylorgallery.com, through tomorrow. (Smith) Galleries: Other 'GIFTS OF THE FOREST: NATIVE TRADITIONS IN WOOD AND BARK' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) * 'EARLY CHINESE BUDDHIST SCULPTURE,' Asia Week is over, but its essence lingers on in this exhibition of beautiful carved stone figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dating from the Northern Wei to Tang periods in China. This is the type of work that elicited rapturous responses when shown in London and Washington a few seasons back. Throckmorton Fine Art, 145 East 57th Street, third floor, (212) 223-1059, through April 14. (Cotter) Last Chance * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PRIVATE TREASURES: FOUR CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTER DRAWINGS,' through Sunday. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The strongest concentration is in Italian drawings. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. (See above.) (Schwendener) * JOHANNES VANDERBEEK The debut solo show of this artist at is a poetic, storybook tableau with a full-scale sculpture of a medieval knight reclining on his tomb and a walled-up archway set in the gallery wall. Both are made of papier-mâché made from old copies of Time and National Geographic. The beautiful little tree that stands between them is also of paper and paste. And check out the time-and-space-warped sleepers in the back room. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Like most great New York spectacles, the Easter Parade is participatory, informal and fashion-driven. Less a parade than a costumed stroll, the event was born in the 1800s, when Manhattan's elite would preen in their holiday finery in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral and other grand churches, then still in the northern outskirts of the city. Before they realized that New Yorkers consider it gauche to gawk, the less privileged would travel uptown to mingle with the wealthy. But over the years the procession (which has no official organizer) evolved from a stiff observance of society types to a casual, silly affair for the wildly dressed masses (and their pets). And one key part of the tradition, the Easter bonnet, has survived, though now the custom-made chapeaus and top hats are joined by towering creations involving action figures, stuffed animals, feathers, and of course eggs. Lee Ilan, 41, an environmental planner and 10-year veteran of the parade, has worn the Chrysler Building, Shea Stadium and the Gates on her head; this year she will be sporting the Coney Island Cyclone. ''The first year I saw somebody who had done the Last Supper made out of Ken dolls,'' she said. ''That was heavy. Literally.''

Coke Protests Jesus Film A protest by the Coca-Cola Company of a movie scene depicting Jesus drinking a can of Coke in the desert has prompted an Italian distributor to postpone the opening of the film, scheduled for today -- Good Friday, Variety.com reported. Starring Luca Ward, the film is ''7 KM da Gerusalemme'' (''Seven Kilometers From Jerusalem''), based on an Italian best seller about an ad executive from Milan whose midlife crisis sends him on a pilgrimage to the present-day Holy Land. There, in the desert near the biblical Emmaus, he gives Jesus a ride in his jeep, hands him a Coke and, while Jesus is alleviating his thirst, says, ''My God, what a testimonial!'' In a letter to the producers, Graziano Prota and Angelo Seconda, Coca-Cola demanded that the scene be cut, saying that it was likely to give Coca-Cola a negative image and that the use of the brand was unauthorized. ''We are not interested in this kind of product placement,'' said a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Italia.

Playboy Indonesia Editor Acquitted An Indonesian court found the editor of Playboy Indonesia not guilty of indecency yesterday, angering conservative Muslims who have been fighting to shut down the magazine since its first appearance last year. The prosecution argued that Erwin Arnada, below, the magazine's editor, was guilty of indecency for selling pictures of women and sought a jail term of more than two years. But the presiding judge, Erfan Basuning, said the arguments did not hold up against laws passed in 1998 guaranteeing freedom of the press. ''This is not only a victory for Playboy, this is a victory for all of the press in Indonesia,'' said Mr. Arnada in an interview. The months-long trial highlighted growing divisions between a rising conservative movement and the majority moderate Muslim population. Hundreds of conservative Muslims, most of whom belong to the Islamic Defender's Front, a hard-line organization that has led the fight against Playboy, protested outside the courtroom during the verdict. Hundreds of police officers were stationed nearby. Playboy Indonesia, published monthly since last April, contains no nude photos, only scantily clad women and articles about Indonesian politics and culture. Far racier magazines are available in all of Indonesia's major cities."

About 120 are competitors in the race. For most of the rest, the tour is part sports spectacle, part Appalachian sightseeing trip and part movable party. Over seven days, the tour moves through a landscape of sandstone ridgelines; gushing, rhododendron-lined creeks; blooming dogwoods; and green mountain vistas. Quirky distractions are inextricably linked to stops along the way: Peachtree City, where cars are banned and residents tool around on 85 miles of golf-cart trails; Dalton, home to more than 100 carpet outlet stores; Rock City, where visitors roam through a network of mountaintop caves adorned with glow-in-the-dark gnomes; Stone Mountain, where a laser light show illuminates the faces of Confederate leaders carved into a massive hunk of granite."

His Skirball show, of course, is the wedding, and for the premiere of ''Bolero NYC,'' he has invited a diverse guest list, bringing on dozens of nonprofessional dancers to augment his company's performance. Known for his interest in capturing the peculiarities of contemporary life, often in small-scale, portraitlike works, Mr. Keigwin has now turned his attention to the Big Apple. Here's hoping it's a good match, made in some no doubt frenetic heaven. (Keigwin Kabaret runs through tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 to $25.

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"(Tonight through Thursday) A three-week series of seriously obscure American musicals, presented as only Bruce Goldstein, the canny repertory programmer of Film Forum, knows how to do. The ''B-Musical'' umbrella is a bit misleading in that several of the pictures don't fit the strict constructionist interpretation of a B-picture (seldom more than 70 minutes; made for the bottom half of a double bill; booked at a flat rather than percentage rate), but who's counting? Among this week's highlights are an Andrews Sisters triple bill on Sunday (including ''Buck Privates'' with Abbott and Costello); three films starring the yodeling country comedian Judy Canova, introduced by her daughter Diana Canova, on Monday; and ''Crazy House,'' Olsen and Johnson's rarely seen follow-up to their great surrealist burlesque, ''Hellzapoppin','' on Tuesday. An exceedingly strange triple bill on Thursday consists of musicals by directors best known for violent, angst-ridden films noirs: Phil Karlson's ''Ladies of the Chorus'' (1949, left, with Marilyn Monroe and Rand Brooks), Anthony Mann's ''Moonlight in Havana'' (1942) and Joseph H. Lewis's ''Minstrel Man'' (1944). The series ends April 19 with a tribute to the queen of the B-musicals, Columbia Pictures' tap-dancing Texan, Ann Miller.

Yes, Barry Bonds is off to his usual slow start; with only one home run as of Thursday, he still needs 21 more to surpass Hank Aaron's career record. But if the Bay has been placid, the usual undercurrents that surround Bonds have been stirring up the ingredients for the perfect baseball storm: pressure, spotlight, history in the making, and the game's most controversial, temperamental player.

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Jazz tribute albums are often concessionary in nature: the subject dictates a repertory and, in many cases, a style. Not so, though, with ''Gardenias for Lady Day'' (Columbia), a 2003 album by the saxophonist James Carter. In name and spirit it's a valentine to Billie Holiday, yet only half of its chosen tracks can be found in the Holiday discography. One of those, the chilling lynching narrative ''Strange Fruit,'' features a vocal by Miche Braden -- but with a stentorian projection quite unlike her predecessor's. And the anchor of that performance is a bitterly caterwauling catharsis, an enactment of violence through timbre; it's not something one associates with Holiday, except perhaps through the early example of one of her inheritors, Abbey Lincoln. Elsewhere the album is more decorous, with string arrangements and debonair ballad interpretations indirectly suggestive of Holiday's general era. The instrumental palette is prodigious -- Mr. Carter, above, deploys tenor, baritone, soprano, mezzo-soprano, F-mezzo and bass saxophones, along with bass and contrabass clarinets -- and the mood is more nervy than cloying. (Mr. Carter pulled off a similar maneuver in 2000 with ''Chasin' the Gypsy,'' which pursued a modern mirage of the guitarist Django Reinhardt.) Of course the balance will probably tip even further toward the emphatic when Mr. Carter performs the music from ''Gardenias'' for the first time on a New York City stage. Along with Ms. Braden and the Akua Dixon String Ensemble, his group will include some Detroit-based colleagues heard on his 2004 Warner Brothers album ''Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge'': the trumpeter Dwight Adams, the pianist Gerard Gibbs, the bassist Ralphe Armstrong and the drummer Leonard King. At times the only thing linking the performance to Holiday might be the simple magnetism of an artist in command of an instrument, engaged by the flicker of a moment.

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Through the 1990s the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art-world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world's great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, at Marian Goodman Gallery in Midtown, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-provoking in the city. Both series of photographs are from 2005, though they are completely different in style, tone, spirit and intent. The pictures of students and tourists at the Prado (above), milling about and chatting in front of various paintings of great attention, fame and devotion, contrive to get us thinking about a cocktail of cultural concerns -- the aura of masterpieces, museums as promenades, art tourism -- to which he adds a touch of farce. Almost nobody in the pictures is looking at the paintings. By contrast, the pictures of crowds pressed in close around Leonardo da Vinci's ''Litta Madonna'' and ''Benois Madonna'' at the Hermitage are deviously direct, the artist zooming in his lens on the facial expressions of the crowd to the exclusion of the paintings. These pictures are a sort of guilty pleasure, owing almost entirely to the cleverness of the artist, who allows us safely to look at others looking at art. You only hope that he is not lurking around the gallery here somewhere with a camera at the ready.

2007-04-06T00:00:00Z,"Many children easily master their A B C's. But even adults can have trouble understanding their A's, T's, C's and G's. In biology A, T, C and G stand for adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine, the four bases that are the chemical building blocks of DNA and the foundation of life. But while their action is complex, appreciating their basic function doesn't require an advanced degree. According to ''Genome: The Secret of How Life Works,'' a touring exhibition at the New York Hall of Science in Queens, the easiest teaching aids are in your kitchen. ''We like to use a recipe analogy, so think of the genome as the cookbook of life,'' Thomas G. Turi, a genomic scientist with Pfizer, said recently as he led a tour of the show, which Pfizer financed. ''The chromosomes might be a chapter, and the genes individual recipes.'' These comparisons infuse several displays in the 5,000-square-foot exhibition, including a whimsical assembly line, the Cookie Factory, which might have been created by a geneticist with Willy Wonka sensibilities. Here a cell's nucleus is a home office, which sends out recipes for proteins to the cell's ribosomes, or factories. But dessert isn't the only metaphor. Proteins are likened to origami -- how they're shaped determines their function -- and principles of heredity are illustrated by a slot machine. Pull the lever and see how hypothetical genes might line up for traits like dimples. Fortunately, the exhibition is more than clever simplification. While a first grader can turn a wheel to compress a DNA model into a double helix, older children and adults can absorb more sophisticated science via filmed interviews, text panels and computer displays. Some information is fascinating, some humbling. What a piece of work is man -- and yet 50 percent of our genes are the same as a banana's.

2007-04-07T18:15:10Z,"The timing of Mike Huckabee's full-show interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" is, let's put it this way, a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it's Easter Sunday, so many of the evangelical voters that the former Arkansas governor and Baptist pastor is courting in his bid for the G.O.P. presidential nod might be focusing more on tomorrow morning's Easter egg hunt than on national politics. On the other hand, presumably because it's Easter, NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" which competes with ""Face the Nation"" in many markets, has only a pundit panel scheduled. So maybe viewers will flip channels in search of harder news."

The younger Pena, the rookie shortstop for the Royals, grounded out to Matsuzaka twice, but he saw a total of 11 pitches and did not seem unnerved. ""I talked to him, but we didn't get into the game,"" Pena, a Yankees coach, said. ""When I talk to him, I try to make it father and son. When he has time away from the ballpark, I want him to be relaxed and not make it about baseball."" Pena smiled as I told him how professionally his son had handled himself in postgame interviews. Pena Jr. praised Matsuzaka, but did not sound as if he had just faced the reincarnation of Tom Seaver. ""He was normal,"" he said of Matsuzaka. ""He's got good stuff."" Real good stuff. Matsuzaka pitched seven innings and whiffed 10 to power the Red Sox past the Royals, 4-1. Pena will get to see Matsuzaka on April 21, when he is scheduled to start against the Yankees at Fenway Park."

Mr. Abu-Jamal, left, in his latest appeal accuses prosecutors of practicing racial discrimination during jury selection. Prosecutors deny that. “Since Mr. Rendell was the elected district attorney at the time in question, and so would have been responsible for the supposed ‘routine’ racially discriminatory practices of Philadelphia prosecutors, Abu-Jamal’s accusations necessarily implicate Mr. Rendell personally,” Hugh J. Burns Jr., an assistant district attorney, wrote in a motion last week."

Then they said it was really all of it, the loud laughing, everything.” The rule was imposed March 29.

But the Pacific fleet lacks any of the system of agreements and mechanisms intended to keep peace in Europe, Mr. Ivanov said. “This is a region where there is a risk of conflict,” he said. “Here you have the United States, China, Korea and Japan, and there are absolutely no rules of the game.”."

The finale of last season's version of the show, ''Super Girl,'' won by Li Yuchun, right, was watched by 400 million viewers, roughly one-third of China's population. ''No weirdness, no vulgarity, no low taste,'' were among the restrictions imposed on the show's producers by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, according to a notice posted on the administration's Web site. In addition, relatives and contestants must do their best not to cry, scream or wail in order to ''maintain a happy and inspiring atmosphere,'' and the judges are prohibited from ''mocking or humiliating contestants.'' Contestants must only sing ''healthy and ethically inspiring'' songs, and the show must not indulge in ''gossip.'' The censor's notice said the rules were aimed at ''preparing a good atmosphere'' before the Communist Party's national congress late this year. The publication of the new rules came amid the initial search for ''Happy Boy'' contestants. Ten thousand people have already applied in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. The search goes nationwide today. A Photographer's Legacy The foundation established after the death of the celebrity photographer Herb Ritts is donating $2.5 million and 189 of his works to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which plans to create a photography gallery in his name, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Mr. Ritts, who died in 2002 at 50, photographed the famous, often for magazines like Vogue and Vanity Fair. The museum mounted a show of his work in 1996 that was derided by many critics but proved to be one of its most popular exhibitions. ''The museum was making a major statement about accessibility, about what we thought was art, and what we thought were the preoccupations of a younger generation in America,'' said Malcolm Rogers, the Boston museum's director. The gift is the largest ever by the Herb Ritts Foundation, which has focused largely on AIDS-related causes since it was founded in 2003. Venice's Pop Menace Conservation organizations say that St. Mark's Square in Venice, below, could be damaged by two concerts to be staged there on June 5 and 6 June by Elton John, The Art Newspaper reported on Thursday. A 1989 concert there by Pink Floyd was attended by about 200,000 people, who left a mess that took three days to clean up. Two sixth-century columns next to the Basilica of St. Mark's were damaged when fans climbed them to get a better view. Anna Somers Cocks, who leads Venice in Peril, a group seeking to preserve the city, said, ''There is no parallel with the Pink Floyd concert as the numbers for Elton John will be strictly controlled, but there is some concern about the weight of the open-air theater and the people on the square as there is a complex system of drains underneath it.'' Maurizio Zanetto, secretary of the Venetian branch of the heritage organization Italia Nostra, said, ''We will do what we can to lobby against the Elton John concerts and raise awareness of the potential damage that will be done to St. Mark's Square.'' But Maurizio Calligaro, chief of staff for the mayor of Venice, noted that a crowd of 5,000 -- the size to which each concert will be limited -- pales beside the 35,000 people who gather in the square on New Year's Eve. Tickets are already on sale online for the concerts, though the city, which will be paid about 200,000 Euros ($268,730) for the use of the square, is not expected to give its permission for the events until next week. Gary Farrow, a spokesman for Elton John, said the singer ''looks forward to a beautiful and harmonious event in the city.'' Art and Abbatoirs Some neighbors of the artist Damien Hirst in the Cotswolds, in central England, are upset over plans to include an ''abattoir rail'' at one of his studios, The Guardian reported on Thursday. The rail could be used to move animal carcasses before they are suspended in formaldehyde, a technique Mr. Hirst, below, made famous through works like ''Mother and Child Divided,'' a cow and a calf each cut in half and displayed in a tank of the preservative. A petition has been started and placards posted around the studio, an old manufacturing plant. Vicky Radwell, whose home overlooks the studio, pronounced herself ''gobsmacked'' by the news. ''Most people around here are quite horrified that there are going to be dead animals there,'' she said ''Dead animals in art is just outrageous. It's not beautiful, is it?'' A spokeswoman for Mr. Hirst said: ''This is nothing to do with an abattoir. It is an area where we will be using formaldehyde. That has been approved and we have planning permission for it. We never have -- and never would -- need an abattoir.'' Who's the Wild One? The founder of the company that produces the ''Girls Gone Wild'' video series has defied a federal judge, refusing to surrender to United States marshals on a contempt citation, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Judge Richard Smoak of United States District Court ordered the company's founder, Joseph R. Francis, into custody after settlement negotiations stalled in a lawsuit brought by seven women who were minors when Mr. Francis' company, Mantra Films, videotaped them at the beach in Panama City, Fla. Mr. Francis, 34, who makes an estimated $29 million a year through the videos of girls exposing their breasts, drew the contempt order on Wednesday after lawyers for the women said Mr. Francis had threatened them during negotiations. ''This judge has gone as far as to call me the devil and an evildoer,'' Mr. Francis said on Thursday. ''It is a case of a judge gone wild.'' Mr. Francis's lawyers have appealed the order, which would send him to jail."

Analysts often point the finger at employment and severance contracts, which can guarantee big salaries and bonuses long before on-the-job performance can be assessed and call for additional payments if the executive is ousted. Companies argue that this is necessary to attract and motivate top talent, and is the price they pay to induce executives to sign noncompete agreements."

2007-04-08T21:12:15Z,"The political polling season is already upon us (a bit prematurely, but everything is ahead of itself these days), and polls taken in the past couple of weeks reveal a pattern that commentators are busy explaining. When the question asked is, which party do you trust to do a better job with the economy, the war, global warming, the environment, education, the deficit, immigration, reputation abroad, the administration of justice, the rebuilding of New Orleans?, the Democratic party wins - and in some categories by impressive margins. The same polls show that 60 to 70 percent of the American people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, and there is no doubt that President Bush's rating numbers are also headed in the wrong direction. Why then do Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama consistently lose to Rudy Giuliani and John McCain in head-to-head matchups? (The three Democrats do outpoll Mitt Romney, but who wouldn't?)The answer usually given is that it's early. Two years out voters are reacting to personalities, or rather, to their perception of personalities. When things get more serious, and the candidates are put under the lens of relentless scrutiny and have to answer hard questions about hard issues, the ratings, we are told, will turn less on personality and more on policy, and the numbers will change."

That's what a number of newspapers and blogs saw in photos of the 15 released British seamen in their grimly fitting, Tehran-issued suits. Essentially, people connected the ugliness of the three-button suits to an ugly purpose: humiliating the British government. A serviceman without uniform or insignia is powerless. And the suits are the opposite of the smartly tapering Savile Row kind, perhaps a statement in itself. Inevitably, some people just saw the horrible sartorial gaffs; one reader of the Guardian, in London, pointed out that men should never button their jackets over a vest and ""never, ever"" button the top button of the jacket."

As Jews began celebrating the eight days of Passover at sundown last Monday, Christians observed the final, most solemn days of Lent in preparation for Easter services this weekend. Here are a handful of stories about different faith communities around the region. Standing tall behind mahogany desks, their sheet music splayed before them, the members of the children's choir of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Fairfield, Conn., looked as serious as the music they were about to sing."

Because of an editing error, the report also misstated the signs' longevity. They have a seven-year warranty, not a seven-year life span."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Gordon Ramsay, the celebrity chef known for such food programs as ''Hell's Kitchen'' in the United States and ''The F-Word'' in Britain, has opened yet another eating establishment in a city already overpopulated with dining rooms bearing his brand. Adding to his roster of nine other London restaurants -- including one at Claridge's and another in the Savoy -- not to mention his outposts in New York, Dubai and Tokyo, Mr. Ramsay last month opened an upscale pub (above) on the banks of the Thames in the East End. It is called the Narrow, and the menu features such dishes as potted Cromer crab and Gloucester pig cheeks with bashed neeps. Guests who don't fancy a pint of beer can always try the pub's original cocktails--though the Wallpaper (Cachaça, passion fruit, vanilla gomme and a touch of chili) sounds more like what the river just washed up than a tasty cocktail. What's next for Mr. Ramsay? Later this year he plans to open yet another ''gastropub,'' the Warrington, in the Maida Vale section of London."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"TWO of the dresser drawers in my 12-year-old daughter's room were broken. It was not the drawers' fault, nor Annie's. It was time. The top of the waist-high dresser had served as a changing table for our four children, and our oldest is now a college freshman. If that baby boy lay on that dresser today, his size 12 feet would scrape the floor. So we threw out the dresser, which led to a reorganization of Annie's clothes, which somehow turned into a major revamping of Annie's room that took most of the weekend. As Annie noted about two hours in, ''This turned out to be an official room-cleaning project, didn't it, Dad?''"

''We're not changing the use of this lot, but trying to get it better organized and make it safer when trucks pull over to hire the workers.''"
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"COULD it be that the mere presence of an English accent is enough to bewitch American audiences into overrating performances by British actors? That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.'' Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?"

The debate goes to the core of a wounded nation's effort to reconcile with its painful past. 1 American fighter jets carried out an airstrike against Shiite militiamen in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya as battles continued in some neighborhoods there for the second straight day, American and Iraqi officials said. 10 Crackdown in Zimbabwe In response to the latest surge of political unrest in Zimbabwe, scores, perhaps hundreds, of people critical of President Robert G. Mugabe's rule are being cornered on sidewalks, hauled to jails or abducted from their homes in night raids and savagely beaten. 14 Cease-Fire Eroding in Gaza Israeli Army helicopters fired at Palestinian militants in the northern Gaza Strip, killing one, the military said. It was the third Israeli military strike in Gaza in 10 days, indicating a further erosion of the cease-fire that was declared in November. 6 Rift Over U.N.

The men he discusses -- Hitler, Goebbels, Julius Streicher, Jesse Owens -- are all called by their last names, but Riefenstahl is ''Leni.'' This often happens with female artists, and it always carries a note of condescension. (Would I, in this letter, speak of James as ''Clive''?) The curious thing is that in his recent book, ''Cultural Amnesia,'' James nowhere places himself on a first-name basis with his female subjects. Why the reversion to the double standard with Riefenstahl? And do the editors of the Book Review think it's O.K. to treat men and women differently in this regard?"

She passed away at 93 after a full and happy life. She was a source of unending love and inspiration for her closely knit family and friends. Graveside services were in Atlanta, and Shiva will continue at the Eizenstat home in Chevy Chase, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Overall, New York's environment did reasonably well in Mr. Spitzer's first budget. The previous administration had severely cut back on the number of experts who are supposed to protect and monitor the state's air, land and water. The new budget adds more than 100 scientists, engineers and enforcement officials to the Department of Environmental Conservation, including a badly-needed new office of climate change. And the Senate approved Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of New York City to be the new environmental commissioner despite a misguided campaign by the gun lobby."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"IT is a season of renewal for Christians and Jews as they commemorate momentous events in their histories: for Christians, the resurrection of Jesus; for Jews, the liberation of the ancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. As Jews began celebrating the eight days of Passover at sundown last Monday, Christians observed the final, most solemn days of Lent in preparation for Easter services this weekend. Here are a handful of stories about different faith communities around the region. To accommodate the children, the Seder last Monday night in the basement recreation room of the Bach Jewish Center in Long Beach, N.Y., began with a sensible nosh: some cucumber salad, some chicken fingers, broccoli and enough soda and water to hydrate the bleachers at Yankee Stadium."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Both David Orr's apt critique of The New Yorker (''Annals of Poetry,'' March 11) and Dana Goodyear's excellent New Yorker article about Poetry magazine would have us believe that the battle for poetry's survival is being waged in the pages of magazines with, respectively, millions of subscribers or millions of dollars in Eli Lilly stock. This is not true. With few exceptions, the best contemporary poetry is being published by hundreds of small presses and little magazines across the country. To name just a few: Ugly Duckling Presse and Circumference in New York, Flood Editions and LVNG in Chicago, and Atelos and Hambone in the Bay Area. Readers who explore these venues will find that poetry is alive and well. Indeed, they'll find the spirit (and the financial uncertainty) of Ezra Pound's collaboration with Poetry magazine's founder, Harriet Monroe."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"The creationism-versus-evolution debate is a quintessential hot-button issue that continues to pop up in the news, and in American courtrooms, with persistent regularity, so it almost always seems to be the right time for a revival of ''INHERIT THE WIND.'' This 1955 courtroom drama, by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, is based on the Scopes ''monkey trial'' of 1925, in which a Tennessee schoolteacher named John Thomas Scopes was charged with breaking a state law that made it illegal to teach any theory denying the concept of creation as taught in the Bible. Two Tony-winning powerhouses will duke it out in the current revival, directed by Doug Hughes (''Howard Katz''). Brian Dennehy is the prosecutor Matthew Harrison Brady, based on William Jennings Bryan, and Christopher Plummer takes up the defense as Henry Drummond, modeled after Clarence Darrow. In previews; opens on Thursday, Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com; $26.25 to 96.25. There's more than one revival with a starry cast opening this week: Kevin Spacey assays another of Eugene O'Neill's alcohol-soaked loners in ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN,'' the third O'Neill play in which Mr. Spacey has appeared on Broadway. This transfer from the Old Vic in London also marks the first collaboration between Mr. Spacey and the director Howard Davies since O'Neill's ''Iceman Cometh,'' which grabbed five Tony nominations in 1999. Mr. Spacey is James Tyrone Jr., and Eve Best plays Josie Hogan in this 1943 heartbreaker about longing, loneliness and love (the unrequited kind). Opens Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com; $26.50 to $102.50. No need to stick to Broadway: The big names in theater don't, and plenty of them are taking part in the Naked Angels Theater Company's ''ARMED AND NAKED IN AMERICA: A NAKED ANGELS ISSUES PROJECT.''

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"MAKING WAVES The News -- The American swimmer Michael Phelps broke five world records at the world swimming championships in Melbourne. Australia, and tied Mark Spitz, the 1972 Olympic champion, as the only man to win seven gold medals in a major meet. Behind the News -- Swimming all four strokes, Phelps, winner of six gold medals at the 2004 Olympics, was unstoppable. As The New York Times's Christopher Clarey put it: ''In a sport in which the numbers after the decimal point usually make the difference between first place and second, Phelps overwhelmed the paradigm at age 21, pulverizing records by a second or two.'' Mark Schubert, the United States coach, called it ''the greatest performance of all time.'' BEING CAREFUL The News -- New York City said that it gave away five million new subway-themed condoms in a month, demolishing the previous record of 2.5 million in July 2005. Behind the News -- Could it be that spring is in the air? That's about two condoms for every man living in the city. Packaged in wrappers with lettering mimicking the logos of the city's subway lines, the condoms are distributed free to doctors, businesses, bars, restaurants and other groups. The release of the city-branded condoms on Valentine's Day coincided with the launch of a Web site -- www.nyccondom.org -- with information on where they are available. The site received nearly 35,000 visits in its first month, Feb. 14 to March 14. FLYING HIGH The News -- Boeing announced that it had sold more than 500 of its fuel-efficient 787 passenger jets since the first plane was ordered in April 2004, making it the fastest-selling commercial airplane in history. Behind the News -- The company has orders from 43 customers for 514 of the jets, though the first one is not scheduled for delivery for more than a year. The plane is designed to burn 20 percent less fuel than comparable airplanes by using more lightweight composites. The biggest of the models can carry up to 330 passengers and travel 3,500 miles without refueling. The Boeing 737 NG set the old record for the fastest-selling plane, with 473 orders before the first was rolled out in December 1996. RAISING CASH The News -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination said it had raised $26 million in the first three months of this year, about three times as much as the previous record at this stage of the race. Behind the News -- The money race is off to a furious start. Senator Barack Obama raised $25 million over the same period; former Senator John Edwards, $14 million. The first-quarter results were seen as an important test of strength. For the first time since public financing for presidential races was adopted in 1974, after Watergate, the top candidates plan to reject public money -- and the spending limits that come with it -- so they can raise as much as they can. RIDING THE RAILS The News -- France's bullet train, the black-and-chrome TGV, set a record for conventional rail trains by reaching a speed of 357.2 miles per hour. Behind the News -- The record exceeded by 37 m.p.h. the previous mark, set in 1990, also by a French train. Credit the performance enhancements. The train normally runs at about 186 miles per hour. But engineers outfitted it with a 25,000-horsepower engine, increased the electrical power from overhead cables, added larger wheels to cover more ground with each rotation and treated the tracks so the wheels could make perfect contact. For all that, it still missed the overall record -- 361 m.p.h., set by Japan's magnetically levitated train in 2003."

Born in 1919 to a family of yachtsmen, the sailor known worldwide simply as Shorty became one of the most successful sailors on the international circuit. In 1954, he was the first non-Englishman to win the Prince of Wales Cup, the top prize of the International 14s. He represented Bermuda at the 1960 Olympics in Italy. In ocean racing, he competed in countless Bermuda and Fastnet Races and was co-founder of the Onion Patch series. He served as Member of Parliament from 1958 to 1980 and as Bermuda's Minister for Tourism from 1972 to 1977. In 1978, he was made Commander of the British Empire by the Queen of England for his services to the island of Bermuda. As merchandising manager for Trimingham Bros., he traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia. These travels inspired his eventual return to the art of photography. A collection of his photographs titled, ''Buddha: The Living Way'' was published by Random House in 1998, with a foreword by the Dalai Lama and text by Pico Iyer. He leaves behind his wife, Dorothy, daughter, Barrie Trimingham, and three grandsons, Stephen, Peter, and Thomas VanDyck."

''In my 20s I was working at Goldman Sachs and wearing bespoke suits,'' he said. ''In my 40s, it's all about jeans and army jackets. Now I can actually wear clothes that I want to wear because I'm actually doing something that I want to be doing.'' Mr. Delavan, 43, who produces photo shoots for Domino, strives to achieve the kind of balance in his wardrobe that he does in the rooms he styles. ''We want our pages to look polished but relaxed -- if a room looks too perfect, we'll mess up the bed a little. It's the same with my clothes. To me, a Thom Browne shirt has the right balance, because it's unironed yet custom-made.'' Too, he has replaced his bench-made shoes with Adidas out of sheer necessity. ''I spend half my day riding my motorcycle to appointments all over the city,'' he explained. ''The rest of the time I'm on shoots, moving couches and hanging paintings.''"

As more of Russia's economy falls under state control, meetings in the Kremlin are becoming an important part of any deal maker's playbook; many analysts say the big deals cannot get done without such gatherings. So it should come as no surprise that the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, has written a letter to Mr. Putin asking for a meeting. The Kremlin's Web site announced the request last week. It was a Goldman analyst who first formulated the idea that the fast-growing so-called B.R.I.C. economies -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- would inevitably outpace today's largest economies."

Faced with unruly middle school students who were flocking to the library after school, library officials announced plans to close on weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m. The resulting uproar was so intense that the town's mayor stepped in to keep the doors open. And in addition to the town's providing security guards at the library's two buildings, community groups decided to extend the hours of after-school programs and expand their offerings."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I just read ''Hotel Trends: The Latest Amenity: A Hypoallergenic Room'' (Practical Traveler, March 25) by Michelle Higgins. As one who has had lifelong food and environmental allergies, I say ''bravo.'' Readers should know, however, that some hotels now permit pets in guest rooms. I had a recent reservation at a hotel in Boca Raton, Fla., which was under new management. Upon checking my hotel reservation before departure, I learned that cats and dogs were permitted to stay in guest rooms. I was assured by the desk clerk that the ''rooms are cleaned thoroughly'' after checkout. But cat dander becomes a permanent fixture; there is no way, short of demolition, that these rooms can be restored to their original dander-free state. Those with cat allergies could develop breathing difficulties upon entering a dander-filled room. Since many hotel guests do not appear to be aware of the current trend to allow pets in rooms, I recommend that travelers inquire about a hotel's pet policy before making reservations.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Q. When my 24-unit building changed owners a number of years ago, the former landlord returned the security deposit on my rent-stabilized apartment. The new landlord made no request for a deposit until recently. On my last lease renewal I was asked to send in a partial deposit, and this year the landlord is demanding the remainder for the full deposit. Since I have lived here now for over a decade without a deposit, can the new landlord demand one now? A. ''The Rent Stabilization Code permits an owner to hold one full month of rent as security,'' said Robert Sokolski, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants. ''And the rent-stabilized lease form contains a provision that the security deposit increases along with the rent.'' Normally, Mr. Sokolski said, security deposits are not given back to the tenants when the building is sold but are passed along to the new owner."

We are deeply indebted to Josh for his professional abilities, his leadership, his vision and integrity, all of which enhanced our practice and greatly enriched our lives. $(6$)LEVINE--Joshua, a resident of Rye, NY, and Palm Beach, FL, died April 6, 2007, at age 90. Born May 24, 1916, in New York City to Jack and Lillian Levine. Josh served in the U.S. Army during World War II, beginning as a Private and discharged as a Captain. In the European Theater of Operations, he investigated claims against the U.S. by Europeans who suffered noncombat damage. Josh graduated from CCNY and NYU School of Law, where he served as President of the student body Pre-Bar Association. Mr. Levine was formerly the managing partner of Davis & Gilbert, where he spent his entire legal career, starting as a law clerk in 1936. He represented many of his firm's leading clients, including Doyle, Dane Bernbach, Benton & Bowles, Ogilvy & Mather, Weight Watchers International, Muzak, and Best Foods. He successfully lobbied the enactment of legislation permitting the manufacture and sale of yellow margarine. Josh handled a broad range of advertising, corporate and securities law problems and engaged in negotiating and consummating the acquisition of advertising agencies worldwide. He was one of six founders of Beth Emeth Synagogue in Larchmont and served as President. He was active in, and was honored by, UJA. He was an avid fisherman and raconteur. Josh was a righteous man, always maintaining the highest morals. A loving husband, father and Poppy, he touched all who knew him. Survived by his wife, Selene, daughters Judi Levine (Bernie Bornstein), Beth Levine (Henry Abarbanel), and Linda (Eric) Spellman, grandchildren Brett, Sara, Lindsey and Matthew, and brother, Harold. Funeral service Sunday, 11:30 am, Zion Memorial Chapel in Mamaroneck, 914381-1809; followed by interment at Sharon Gardens Cemetery.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"For the first time in more than a month, the Rangers exhaled. They skated off the ice Saturday after losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 2-1, not knowing who their first-round opponent in the postseason would be. Only when they stepped into the locker room did they learn that they had clinched sixth place in the Eastern Conference and would play the Atlanta Thrashers in the first round."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"EVERY morning, as I climb the stairs and trudge down the hall to my office, I pass over a section of floor that gives a noticeable groan. In former years, I made a mental note to one day pry up the offending plank and pad it with another layer of butcher paper. I also conceded this probably would come after about 200 other pressing chores. The beauty of this task deferred is that I've grown accustomed to the sound. In fact, I now regard it as a greeting from an old friend."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Regarding ''South Africa: In the Dark in the Park, With the Wild Things'' (Journeys, March 18): Rob Nixon makes clear his view that nighttime drives into the wildlife parks of Africa are a great idea and a boon for tourists wanting to see African animals. Doesn't he realize that these animals are being forced to deal with increasing human intrusion -- now not only during the day-- but at night as well, when humans would normally have retreated? Why do humans think it's their right to disturb wildlife wherever it exists? It would be nice to read about the negative impact of this sort of activity. In other words -- a balanced view. Heather G. Irons Berkeley, Calif."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,David Rieff paints what he calls ''Democratic antiwar protesters'' with too broad a brush (March 25). Many of us protest the Iraq war for its futility rather than as a retreat from American influence and power in the region. A drawdown would enable us to confront the larger Iranian threat without being exposed and weakened by our involvement in Iraq.
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"IN 1970, not long after Lesley Dormen moved to New York City, she was asked out on a date. Ms. Dormen, a new college graduate from Ohio, was working in Midtown at a magazine published by the Girl Scouts of America. When the designated Friday evening arrived, ''I came out of my office, and it was raining and there weren't any cabs available,'' she said. ''I didn't know how to take the subway. I couldn't ask; I didn't dare. It was too shameful not to know. So I walked.'' Her destination was Park Avenue and 90th Street. ''I remember he dried my hair with a towel when I got there,'' she said."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"IT is a season of renewal for Christians and Jews as they commemorate momentous events in their histories: for Christians, the resurrection of Jesus; for Jews, the liberation of the ancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. As Jews began celebrating the eight days of Passover at sundown last Monday, Christians observed the final, most solemn days of Lent in preparation for Easter services this weekend. Here are a handful of stories about different faith communities around the region. Standing tall behind mahogany desks, their sheet music splayed before them, the members of the children's choir of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Fairfield, Conn., looked as serious as the music they were about to sing."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"COULD it be that the mere presence of an English accent is enough to bewitch American audiences into overrating performances by British actors? That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.'' Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?"

The plant was also forced to retest its new emergency system after problems arose with 123 of 150 new sirens. Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns and operates the plant, said the shutdown occurred at 4 a.m. Tuesday after operators noticed that the water level in the steam generators had dropped.

Since graduation, I've become a lawyer, a spouse, a mother and an active volunteer in my community. Throughout, I've searched for someone to assure me that I'm ''normal'' -- as the voices periodically return. Everyone in the mental-health field has recommended medicating them away.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"In the event that you are immune to the glories of ''The Sopranos,'' which returns for its final season on Sunday, you will need something to hold your attention, and that something just might be the ''Masterpiece Theater'' production of ''THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS,'' on PBS the same evening. Based on Kenneth Grahame's children's book about a few anthropomorphized members of the animal kingdom, this adaptation stars Bob Hoskins and the British comedian Matt Lucas, among others. Just like ''The Sopranos,'' the story features a scalawag son of great wealth, but his name isn't Anthony Jr. It's Mr. Toad. Also returning for a new season Sunday is ''ENTOURAGE'' (HBO, at 10 p.m.). Ari has been fired as Vince's agent. Replacing him now is another young power agent, Amanda (Carla Gugino), who wants Vince to break out of the box, play against type. What is her idea for him exactly? A costume drama based on an Edith Wharton novel. (What fun Wharton would have had with the codes and excesses of young millennial-era celebrity!) If you have had it with urbanites in their 30s, obsessing about conception, pregnancy, baby nurses and Lamaze classes, and if you just can't help feeling wistful for the days when young marrieds just drank too much and cheated, then tread cautiously toward the premiere of ''NOTES FROM THE UNDERBELLY'' on Thursday (ABC, 10 p.m.), directed by the filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld. The series makes a fetish of everything prenatal. An exercise in Gucci-free earnestness, ''THE BRICK AWARDS,'' to be broadcast on Thursday (CW, 9 p.m.), honors young adults who have done something good for the world in public health, environmental preservation and other fields.

Giving audiences of all ages the opportunity to hear something approximating a full complement of musicians if their only option is tape or a truncated orchestra seems worth the downside. The same reasoning does not apply to Broadway productions however. People come from all over the world to Broadway, and they want something they can't get at home. It should be live theater, with a live orchestra in the pit. Leida Snow Manhattan"

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"A review on March 18 about ''The First Man-Made Man: The Story of Two Sex Changes, One Love Affair, and a Twentieth-Century Medical Revolution,'' by Pagan Kennedy, refers incorrectly to Michael Dillon, the main subject of the book, who was born a woman. Dillon's sex change is considered the first of the modern era because of its surgical sophistication and its early use of testosterone, starting in 1938. But he was not ''the first person on record to undergo surgery to change his gender.'' (Records of surgery to alter sexual characteristics go back to ancient times.)"

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"The New York State Legislature passed a practically on-time budget last week with a lot in it to be happy about. That good news was obscured almost immediately by rounds of loudly self-serving analysis by lawmakers over the way the budget distributes education aid to the New York suburbs. Neither the complaining (in Westchester) nor the crowing (on Long Island) was entirely appropriate. It's complicated, but let's discuss. One of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's prime directives on taking office was to overhaul New York's perverse system of doling out school aid. It is called a ''formula,'' a label meant to give the appearance of mathematical objectivity to what has been a yearly exercise in political scheming and muscle-flexing."
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"While most of the spring exhibitions are already in full swing, the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM is gearing up for a series of shows beginning Saturday and running throughout the summer. Occupying large portions of the Guggenheim's Frank Lloyd Wright building, they will include everything from paintings and sculptures to video and site-specific installations. Using only works from the museum's permanent collection, curators have organized a series of four sequential shows under the overall title ''THE SHAPES OF SPACE.'' All the art will explore the meaning of space as an abstract concept. Rather than tackle the subject chronologically, each exhibition will combine works from different periods, from the early 20th century to the present. Much of the art will be organized by theme, illustrating the artistic meaning of space in all its permutations. Several large-scale contemporary works recently acquired by the Guggenheim will form the core of the exhibition. On the ground floor, visible from the outside of the building at night, will be Alyson Shotz's ''Shape of Space,'' a 2004 work from which the show is derived. It is a giant, shimmering wall of more than 18,000 ovals of hand-cut plastic that captures and refracts light. Another monumental work in the show is Pipilotti Rist's ''Himalaya's Sister's Living Room,'' from 2000, which recreates a dimly lighted, cluttered domestic interior meant to explore the thoughts and memories contained within a household space. Other artists on view are Piet Mondrian, Larry Bell, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Sarah Morris and Piotr Uklanski. Through Sept. 5, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. ''The Shapes of Space,'' coincides with another exhibition opening Saturday at the Guggenheim, this one documenting the continuing restoration of the museum's Frank Lloyd Wright building. ''FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: RESTORING A MASTERPIECE,'' on view through July 8, will include photographs, drawings and computer-generated images as well as interviews with the team involved in the restoration, repair and conservation. Every part of the project will be explored, from restoring the exterior of the building to reinforcing the upper ramp walls and replacing the windows."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Jonathan Allen's ''India Made Easy'' (March 25) forgot one vital detail about traveling from America to the opposite side of the world. No matter how well planned your travels, when you return home it typically takes days to make the physical transition to your home time zone. The common rule is: one day for every one hour difference in time. Some people flying to India make the transition to that time zone with greater ease than others. However, rarely have I seen it the other way around. No matter the sleep aids, drugs, or homeopathic remedies are -- on a return it takes days to get back to everyday life. Realities of our body's time clock should not be forgotten in planning and enjoying a trip. Maxine W. Davis Minneapolis"
2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"FOULKE--William G. 94, on March 30th, 2007, at home in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, PA. Retired Chairman of Provident National Bank (a predecessor to PNC Bank); civic leader in Philadelphia. He established Provident as a leading provider of trust services, thus laying the groundwork for PNC's investment management business. Upon retirement from Provident he became Chairman of Pardee Resources Company, a family enterprise founded by his grandfather. A graduate of St. Paul's School, Concord, NH and Princeton University, he was known for his foresightedness, gentle humor and kindness. At the height of the energy crisis of the 1970s, he commuted by train from Chestnut Hill to conserve energy but steadfastly refused to fire the driver provided by the bank to take him to various meetings saying that the man had a wife and children to support and that the crisis would not last forever. In 1934, he captained the Princeton tennis and squash teams and won the squash intercollegiate championship. Many years later, he became a national senior doubles court tennis champion. He was an avid fly fisherman and boating enthusiast. He had a marvelous 67 year marriage to the former Louisa Lawrence Wood, who predeceased him in 2001. Ten years previously, they both broke their necks in a car accident but miraculously survived without spinal column injury. He always said he was a lucky man. We were lucky to know him. He is survived by three married children, Louisa and Bill Newlin, of Washington, D.C., Walter and Wendy Foulke of Philadelphia, PA, and Bill and Wendy Foulke of Bedford, NY, and by eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at St. Thomas' Church, Whitemarsh, PA at noon on Friday, April 20th.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"COULD it be that the mere presence of an English accent is enough to bewitch American audiences into overrating performances by British actors? That's the cheeky suggestion made recently by the British actor, novelist, critic and all-around cultural Renaissance guy Stephen Fry. ''I shouldn't be saying this -- high treason really -- but I sometimes wonder if Americans aren't fooled by our accent into detecting a brilliance that may not really be there,'' he told the British magazine Radio Times. ''I mean, would they notice if Jeremy Irons or Judi Dench gave a bad performance? Not that those two paragons ever would, but it's worth considering.'' Blimey, that's food for thought, as is this: ''When American TV and movies call for a twist of limey in their cocktail, it's usually a character they're after -- supervillain, emotionally constipated academic, effete eccentric, that kind of thing.'' He may be on to something there. After all, didn't the creators of the three-part ''Die Hard'' franchise twice reach out for Britons -- Mr. Irons and Alan Rickman -- to play foils both evil and classy enough to square off against Bruce Willis?"

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Right now, however, the bottle redemption bill itself needs to be redeemed. Many lawmakers have been wanting to pass the bill, a perfect fit for those in both parties who label themselves environmentalists. But the bill faces powerful lobbyists from the beverage industry who have been working against it for years because they earn millions of dollars when consumers fail to redeem their bottles and cans."

It is admirable that he leads by example and communicates directly with teammates instead of through the news media. But some may find his assertion that, ''It's not my job to change the way fans act,'' somewhat hypocritical, if unintentional. Jeter was defending his public nondefense of Alex Rodriguez throughout all the booing that Rodriguez endured last season. Fair enough. But fans don't forget how Jeter supported Jason Giambi when the boos were directed at him."

As Jews began celebrating the eight days of Passover at sundown last Monday, Christians observed the final, most solemn days of Lent in preparation for Easter services this weekend. Here are a handful of stories about different faith communities around the region. To accommodate the children, the Seder last Monday night in the basement recreation room of the Bach Jewish Center in Long Beach, N.Y., began with a sensible nosh: some cucumber salad, some chicken fingers, broccoli and enough soda and water to hydrate the bleachers at Yankee Stadium."

And in addition to the town's providing security guards at the library's two buildings, community groups decided to extend the hours of after-school programs and expand their offerings."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"''OPERATION HOMECOMING'' is an unusual documentary that explores the experience of living through war, as told by the American soldiers who are fighting in it. Robert Duvall, Aaron Eckhart and Josh Lucas are among the actors doing dramatic readings of various soldiers' writings. These private works, including letters, poems, essays, journals and fiction, open a window into the personal impact of recent conflicts. The film is an initiative created by the National Endowment for the Arts, which worked with the documentary maker Richard E. Robbins. It had its debut in February at Film Forum in New York and opened theatrically on Friday in Los Angeles and Boston but will also be released this week in Seattle, St. Louis and other cities. Those who miss it in theaters can catch it on April 16 on most PBS stations. ''AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS'' is a movie better seen late, perhaps in an altered state of some kind. This R-rated, 2-D animated feature is about three crime-fighting fast food items -- Frylock, Master Shake and Meatwad -- seeking truth and justice (not really). It's a feature-length riff on the animated series created by a couple of offbeat slackers, Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, whose series can be seen be seen on the Cartoon Network's late-night block of programming, Adult Swim. The creators' sense of humor makes ''South Park'' look positively tame. (One of the more printable things they do is set a poodle on fire.) The series has a cult following, natch, so screenings might be raucous affairs. Opens nationwide Friday."

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"DROHAN--William N. Died peacefully at his home in Germantown, MD, on Sunday, March 25, following a four-year battle with metastatic lung cancer. Dr. Drohan, formerly of Springfield, VA, and Santa Monica, CA, was 60. He was a well-known microbiologist and educator who will be remembered for many contributions to science, especially his commitment to improving blood safety, his pioneering work in transgenic proteins to treat hemophilia and other bloodrelated disorders, important contributions made in investigating mad cow disease in the blood supply, and his development of novel ways to treat traumatic injuries including bandages to stem hemorrhage. He received a B.A. degree in Bacteriology from UCLA and a Ph.D. in Medical Microbiology and Immunology from UCLA School of Medicine. Dr. Drohan was equally dedicated to scientific research and to mentoring students and young scientists. His career included important positions with the National Cancer Institute, the American Red Cross, and private companies dedicated to treating bloodborne disorders, most recently as Chief Scientific Officer at STB, Ltd., as well as Chief Scientific Officer at Inspiration Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., and previously Chief Scientific Officer of Clearant, Inc. He also served as Professor in the Graduate Program of the Department of Genetics of George Washington University and formerly as Adjunct Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at the University of Maryland. Dr. Drohan published more than 145 scientific papers and holds 30 U.S. patents. He served on the editorial boards of several scientific journals, and was a member of the Scientific Steering Committee for Blood Products at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and Chairman for the Panel on Biotechnology of the National Research Council. Bill is survived by his beloved wife, Marian, and their five children, Colleen (Ross), Maureen, Kathleen, Laura, and Craig; his brothers and sisters, Robert, Judy, Christina, Deborah, Brian, and Theresa; as well as numerous cousins, nieces, and nephews. He leaves to them and to his friends, colleagues, and students, a legacy of scientific achievement and inspirational leadership accompanied by an extraordinary level of kindness and generosity. The Coalition for Hemophilia B has established a scholarship fund in Bill's name. In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to The Dr. William N. Drohan Scholarship Fund, 225 West 34th Street, Suite 710, New York, NY 10122.

''Flavio'' repeats Thursday and Saturday, ''Cesare'' on Friday. Handel operas have become a major new archaeological dig for opera companies and an increasing audience favorite; ''Cesare'' has helped lead the restoration.

In the photo, I was trying to get a breath of fresh air and a little space from my seatmate, whom we had dubbed Madame Crazy. She had some strange habits, including scratching flakes of skin off her feet and brushing them onto me. We had a very intimate time together, Madame Crazy and I, sleeping curled up next to each other like kittens. Despite the filth and the heat, it was a great way to start off the trip: 48 hours with absolutely nothing to do but think about what I was embarking on and stare out the window watching the baobab trees go by.''

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"Should you happen to wander into Dance Theater Workshop's gallery space this month, be prepared to be confronted with your own likeness, or some version of it. In ''A CURE FOR SURVEILLANCE,'' Jonah Bokaer and Liubo Borissov have used motion-capture technology to record images of the dancers Michelle Mola and Douglas Letheren. This archive of movements will be intertwined with live images of people entering the gallery; that means you, boys and girls. ''Surveillance'' inaugurates the workshop's Gallery Installation Fellowship program, so expect more experiments in the coming months. Monday through April 28, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, with a public reception on Friday from 6 to 7:30 p.m., 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-007, 2rem.net/projects/cure4s; free. While Mr. Bokaer and Mr. Borissov toy with the fear that somebody is always lurking and watching, a new work by Amanda Loulaki and Short Mean Lady goes in the opposite direction, exploring the fear of emptiness. In ''DELIRIUM, OR THAT TASTE IN MY MOUTH,'' Ms. Loulaki, a Crete-born choreographer, working with the performers Carolyn Hall, Rebecca Serrell and Pedro Osorio, plays with a nonlinear structure, making free association more important than more traditional notions of context and narrative. Thursday through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15.

On opening night another dancer, Saar Harari, tore his meniscus, and the rest of the run had to be canceled. Perhaps the choreographer, Pavel Zustiak, should consider a more hopeful title for his next dance. But first, ''Le Petit Mort'' lives again. In addition to Mr. Zustiak and his fine ensemble of dancers, including the terrific Gina Bashour, the dark, sexually charged show boasts contributions from the video artist Tal Yarden and an accompanying exhibition by the photographer Jose Aragon.

2007-04-08T00:00:00Z,"''Rare'' concert appearances are usually not so rare; touring pays, so if they can get a gig, most musicians will sooner or later find their way back to New York. But this week is a true rarity: JANDEK, a Texas singer, guitarist, occasional keyboardist and all-around musical sphinx who since the late 1970s has released dozens of strange and challenging albums while having virtually no public persona. Creaky and dissonant, with vocals that go from wounded groans to screams, his music is a nightmarish variation of folk-rock, and over the years he has become a kind of Thomas Pynchon of music. For years no one was sure if the gaunt figure pictured on Jandek's album covers was even him. But a few years ago Jandek -- whose real name may or may not be Sterling Smith -- started to break out of his shell with a very light touring schedule that included a couple of shows in New York. Onstage he was appropriately enigmatic: Beanpole-thin, with a pale, severe face, he played stark, squally music with a small band, not speaking a word to his audience. But everybody clapped madly nonetheless, and is sure to do again on Saturday when Jandek returns for one show, backed by Tim Foljahn (of Two Dollar Guitar) on bass and the drummer Jim White (of the Dirty Three). To date Jandek is believed to have played fewer than 30 concerts. Who knows when, or if, he will return again? 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, henrystreet.org; $20."

2007-04-09T13:58:06Z,"Carried interest, a major source of fees for private equity funds, has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks, as some lawmakers started talking up the notion of taxing it at a higher rate. Now comes more fodder for debate: Buyouts magazine reports that some midsize private equity firms are raising their carried interest (essentially their cut of the profits from a fund's investments) from the industry standard of 20 percent to 25 percent. As described by Dan Primack of PE Week Wire, the higher fee is part of a tradeoff: In exchange for the extra 5 percent, a firm agrees to hold down the size of the fund it is raising."

2007-04-09T11:38:12Z,"Fashion designers take the bows, yet the fashion world knew of Steven Robinson, the assistant to John Galliano, who died suddenly last week in Paris at 38. Steven worked with John at both Dior and Galliano, on men's and women's, on haute couture and ready-to-wear, and they worked together from the late 1980s, when chronically short of money, everything rode on hopefulness and John's genius. When John went to Dior, so did Steven and Bill Gaytten, his other longtime assistant. I always thought of them as the luckiest boys in fashion - hard-working, yes, but lucky, lucky to be in Paris at that time in their lives. Steven helped make real John's fantastic ideas, though somehow this doesn't really touch all that he did. Steven was usually the first person I'd see backstage after a show. A burly figure, he always looked flushed and happy and in a hurry. ""Did you like the show?"" he'd say, and, of course, I knew that he knew that I did. ""Yes, Steven."" It took nothing away from Steven Robinson that he was the assistant in the house. It is a great pity that he is gone."

But he's not a teenager from Nebraska anymore: he's a 27-year-old bandleader and one of indie rock's biggest stars. And he paused to think about it, which can be a mistake."

''Ojos Negros,'' his new duet album with the classical cellist Anja Lechner, is a slow, luxurious version of that gray. It relates to specific musical styles and histories only in passing. Moving through original harmonic routes, thick with intelligent emotion, the record is original, easy to understand and difficult to absorb.

2007-04-09T00:00:00Z,"Something to keep in mind around mid-April: The state's new $1.3 billion school property tax relief program is taxable. That's right, for those who itemize property tax deductions on either their federal or state returns, New York's property tax rebate checks, which were doubled this year, are effectively taxable income, according to Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group. Because of differences between New York and federal tax rules, more New Yorkers are likely to itemize on their federal returns and not on their state returns, Mr. McMahon said. In a hypothetical situation he described in a research note last week, Joe and Debbie Jones have a $5,000 property tax bill and get a $400 rebate check from the state. Because they itemize their deductions, they can claim only $4,600 in property taxes paid on their 2007 federal return."

The manatee remains protected under the federal Endangered Species Act, making it illegal to harass, poach or kill the animals. A five-year review by the agency of manatee populations in Florida and Puerto Rico found that the species no longer fit the criterion to be deemed endangered: immediate risk of extinction. Threatened status means a species could become endangered in the future if protections are not maintained. This year’s manatee census recorded 2,812 in Florida water. In 1991, the survey’s first year, 1,267 manatees were counted. Patrick Rose, executive director of the Save the Manatee Club, said a classification switch could mean changes in boating and development restrictions that were established to protect manatees."

Reality television in Italy has taken a new turn, with the introduction of a show that lets mothers choose their son's wives, Reuters reported. Critics responded immediately by saying that the show, ''Perfect Bride,'' insulted women and demonstrated that Italian television, which already carries reality programming like ''Big Brother'' and ''Celebrity Island,'' had fallen to a new low. In the first episode of ''Perfect Bride,'' carried on RAI, the state broadcaster, the jury of mothers of five single men quizzed 18 bridal candidates about their suitability as wives. Beginning next week the mothers and potential daughters-in-law will live in a ''Big Brother''-style house where the candidates' ability to handle household chores can be scrutinized. Viewers will have a chance to take part in voting off the brides they dislike. The mothers are known by their first names, like Mamma Teresa and Mamma Ambra. Mamma Teresa said she was looking for ''a simple, intelligent classy girl'' for her son Claudio. ''I would like someone who's not too ostentatious and who knows how to take care of the family.'' As for Claudio, she said: ''He has too many girlfriends. I want to find him his ultimate woman.'' Prize for Elizabeth Spencer Elizabeth Spencer has been named the winner of the 20th annual PEN/Malamud Award. The accolade recognizes a body of work that demonstrates excellence in short fiction. Ms. Spencer, who teaches writing at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, is the author of seven collections of short fiction, nine novels, a memoir and a play. Reviewing Ms. Spencer's 2001 collection ''The Southern Woman,'' Molly Haskell wrote: ''Her light touch, cool ironies and subtle class distinctions have enough in common with Henry James or British writers like Elizabeth Bowen and Muriel Spark to unsettle readers expecting the danker moss-laden landscape of deep-Southern fiction. Eudora Welty once compared her to Katherine Mansfield, and the great Canadian short story writer Alice Munro is perhaps a sister under the skin.'' The PEN/Malamud Award includes a reading in the PEN/Faulkner reading series at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington and $5,000."

But early recognition of heart attack is a sadly limited approach to heart disease prevention. We have long known that populations with comparable genetic susceptibilities, living in different environments, experience dramatically varying rates of heart disease. Most experts concur that routine application of what we already know about healthful lifestyle could reduce heart disease rates in the United States by 80 percent."

One out of every 200 films shows a suspicious pattern the radiologist recognizes from years of experience. It's tedious work in a dark room with a magnifying glass. And mammograms are often read twice - another $120. A new system called computer-aided detection, or CAD, can identify the same patterns a doctor can, by referring to a database of known cancer films. And now a third of all second mammogram readings are done by CAD, for $20 each. But the study from the University of California, Davis, showed that a radiologist with CAD was statistically no better than a radiologist alone in finding cancer. Round 1: Doctors."

He added that Mr. Salvio told the undercover officer to make the killing look like a robbery at his mother&#8217;s home in Astoria and said he could keep three coats &#151; a mink, a fox, and a raccoon &#151; worth $10,000."

Roberts Jr., a former Army soldier and veteran transit executive, has been chosen to lead New York City Transit, which runs the city&#8217;s subway and bus systems, transit officials said yesterday.

2007-04-11T00:00:00Z,"Machinery orders at Japanese companies fell more than expected in February from the previous month, but the figures did little to change the view that corporate investment remains strong. Core private sector machinery orders, an important gauge of corporate capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 5.2 percent in February from January. The figure was below economists’ median forecast of a 0.2 percent fall, and followed a 3.9 percent rise in January, the biggest gain since last August, when orders jumped 6.7 percent. The market reacted little, as the data did not alter the view that the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates gradually after lifting them to a decade-high 0.5 percent in February. In separate data, the government said that Japan’s current-account surplus rose to 2.4175 trillion yen ($20.31 billion) in February, 4.9 percent more than a year earlier."

The bid by Wesfarmers, a conglomerate with operations ranging from home improvement sales to fertilizer manufacturing, is already the biggest ever in Australia. The chairman of Coles, Richard H. Allert, left, said in a statement that Kohlberg Kravis was confident it could equal or beat the Wesfarmers bid for Coles, which put itself up for sale in February.

2007-04-11T00:00:00Z,"A 35-year-old British woman, Natallie Evans, left, who was left infertile after being treated for ovarian cancer, has no right to use frozen embryos against the wishes of her former fiancé, who provided the sperm, the European Court of Human Rights ruled. The court’s Grand Chamber, sitting in Strasbourg, France, confirmed a lower European ruling upholding a British law that stipulates consent from both parents is needed at every stage of the in vitro fertilization process. The verdict cannot be appealed, and the frozen embryos will be destroyed. The court said it felt “great sympathy” for Ms. Evans, but ruled that her desire to become a parent should not be accorded greater weight than her former fiancé’s right not to have a genetically related child with her. In 2001, before removal of her ovaries, six of Ms. Evans’s eggs were fertilized by sperm of the fiancé, Howard Johnston. But the couple split up, and Mr. Johnston withdrew his consent for her to use the embryos. Ms. Evans took the case through the British courts, and when she had exhausted that legal process, she appealed to the European courts, claiming her right to privacy and family life, and the embryos’ right to life, were being violated by Mr. Johnston’s refusal to grant permission for use of his sperm. “I am distraught at the court’s decision today,” Ms. Evans said. “It’s very hard for me to accept that the embryos will now be destroyed and that I will never become a mother.” Mr. Johnston said that while he sympathized, “I want to be able to choose when I become a parent.”."

The small tufts of brown hair were displayed in a glass case and will eventually be put on exhibit next to Ramses’ mummy at the museum. An Egyptian archaeological delegation traveled to Paris last week to retrieve the strands, which were put up for sale on a Web site last November by a Frenchman who offered them for $2,600. The seller apparently obtained the items from his late father, a French researcher who examined the mummy when it was brought to France in 1976 for treatment to stop the spread of a rare fungus. “I was so upset,” said Zahi Hawass, the chief of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. “How the hair of the mummy — of the greatest king of Egypt — can be sold on the Internet!”."

2007-04-11T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Human hubris is reaching new heights (''Backyard Pests? Think of Them as Dinner,'' April 4). In an urban landscape with few enough opportunities for contact with living things other than Homo sapiens, Steven Rinella has launched a war on the few species who have learned to survive with humans in our denatured world of concrete and cement. When we no longer feel the childish joy of watching frolicking squirrels, when we just ''thump them with a hammer,'' we are beyond cynical and inhumane: we are cruel and heartless and lost as a society. I suggest that Mr. Rinella be delivered into the Great North Woods with only a knife for survival if he needs to deal with his primitive longings for trapping and skinning our fellow creatures. Let him leave the few furry and feathered inhabitants of our city alone to scurry and scamper and provide a morning bird song. MARILYN KISS Staten Island To the Editor: Sparrows and squirrels are among the least pesky of all New York City creatures. I'll bet Mr. Rinella doesn't eat rat. ROSE CONSTANTINE New York To the Editor: All our songbirds are protected by federal and state laws, and ''thumping'' wild animals with a hammer is a crime, covered under cruelty-to-animals statutes. Migrating birds have enough problems as it is, and certainly don't need to be illegally trapped and killed by the likes of Mr. Rinella, apparently for his amusement. I spent 25 years in law enforcement in Suffolk County, N.Y., and can tell you that a number of people have been arrested and convicted of similar acts. I only hope such a fate befalls this so-called gourmet chef, and that they take away his ''thumping'' hammer as well. RICHARD E. WILLOTT Southold, N.Y. To the Editor: Since Steven Rinella's recent New York arrival, his macabre activities -- stealing pigeons, battering backyard sparrows and squirrels -- threaten any free-living animals who manage to live among us. Mr. Rinella, who authored a cookbook based on consuming animals whose freedom the chef has usurped, says cooking without ''game'' isn't fun -- as if systematically disrespecting other conscious beings merits admiration, or at least interest. Animal rights is a movement to overcome everyday domination, and to value other creatures' interests in living on their own terms. Plant-based cuisine puts that principle into action immediately. Thus the cookbook author, chef or anyone with access to a kitchen decides whether our culture moves in a nonviolent direction. The sign of a mature society might well be the idea that we could have a whole lot more fun, and enjoy our planet fully, were respect a hallmark of our species. PRISCILLA FERAL Darien, Conn. The writer is the president of Friends of Animals. To the Editor: Even though I'm an animal lover and a vegetarian, currently watching squirrels and birds peacefully enjoying a spring day outside, I find this article neither amusing nor relevant to ''Dining Out.'' The next time Mr. Rinella is rolling around on the ground from a painful shot in the eye of fluid released from a goose gallbladder, maybe he should consider the torture he inflicts on these helpless creatures with his homemade traps.

Opponents of the center, including some whose properties are second homes, have taken their disagreement to court, describing the voting process as flawed.

CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' dominated the 10 o'clock hour (15.9 million), while ABC led from 8 to 9:30 with ''Dancing With the Stars'' (18.7 million). CBS and ABC tied for first among adults 18 to 49, although ABC edged slightly ahead in total viewers. In third, Fox finished even with NBC, whose new improv comedy, ''Thank God You're Here,'' made a respectable debut at 9, with 8.3 million viewers. In the evening news race, ABC's ''World News With Charles Gibson'' ranked first in total viewers, with an average of 8.1 million, posting its largest lead in a year and a half over the No. 2 newscast, ''NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams'' (7.6 million). Among adults 25 to 54, however, ABC's lead over NBC was a negligible 60,000 viewers. In third, the ''CBS Evening News With Katie Couric'' drew 6.2 million viewers. BENJAMIN TOFF"

2007-04-11T00:00:00Z,"IF you can make meatloaf you can make what the French call pâté de campagne, or country pâté. It is simply a variation of meatloaf, a splendid one. It is denser, with more meat, and has no filler like bread crumbs. The addition of cream and spices makes it delicious and elegant enough to serve at dinners where you want to impress your guests. Meatloaf can't do that. Good pâté has the following qualities: meat of varying textures, some ground and some chopped. Spices in big enough pieces to have some bite. And the richness and flavor that come only from quantities of fat."

The daughter of Mae Simon, a star of the Yiddish Theater, and Herman Rubenstein, the ''actor's lawyer,'' she was a quintessential New Yorker who loved music, art, and almost nightly performances at Lincoln Center. She was an extraordinarily independent woman from the days when being one was uncommon. A journalist and public relations specialist, she ended her career as the Director of Publications at Kingsborough Community College of CUNY. She touched many lives by her generosity. She gave financial assistance, gifts, mementos, reminders and her famous New York Times personal clipping service to her friends and extended family. She loved Italy and into her eighties, her favorite, if unorthodox, choice of travel there was via freighter. She lived life her way, and spread an impish joy to those fortunate enough to share her space. She was dearly loved and will be sorely missed.

Despite some persistent problems -- an epidemic of head injuries from legal but malicious checks, a pro-fighting backlash against new rules designed to reduce violence and lagging attendance in several cities -- the hallmark of the 2006-7 season has been an abundance of beautiful, creative goal-scoring. Buffalo and Detroit have scored those beautiful goals most often, the main reason they finished first in their conferences and are the favorites to win the Stanley Cup. Many of the Sabres' goals have come from gorgeous clockwork passing on full-tilt rushes to the net, reminiscent of the great Soviet teams of the 1970s. Many of the Red Wings' goals have come from precision combination play in tight spaces, an ingenious game of high-speed tic-tac-toe."

2007-04-11T00:00:00Z,"Le Sousbois is a rare artisanal cheese from Switzerland with a story to tell. Robert and Anne Henchoz from Rossinière, in the Vaud region of southwestern Switzerland, make about 2,000 of these cow's milk cheeses each month. The cheeses have a grassy aroma and come in thick disks about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Beneath the cross-hatched ivory rind is a satiny, mildly pungent, spoonable interior. A band of spruce bark is wrapped around it. That band of spruce got the Henchozes in trouble with the people who make Vacherin Mont d'Or, a better-known Swiss washed-rind cheese that is similarly wrapped. But the couple was allowed to continue production when they proved that the wrapper was the only thing their cheeses had in common with Vacherin. Until recently Le Sousbois was sold only from early winter until mid-April, but production has increased, so it will be around at least until June. It is being served at Trestle on Tenth, left, where the whole cheese, for the table, is $16. It is also sold at Formaggio Essex in the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side, and at the Formaggio Kitchen stores in Cambridge and Boston, for $8.95; at formaggio-kitchen.com, it's $10.95."

Millions for Chinese Art A rare oil by the artist Xu Beihong went for $9.2 million at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong, a record for a Chinese painting at auction, Reuters reported. Mr. Xu, who lived from 1895 to 1953, is considered the father of modern Chinese painting. The work, ''Put Down Your Whip,'' above, depicting a 1939 anti-Japanese street play in China, went to an anonymous bidder on Saturday. In four days of sales that ended yesterday, Sotheby's sold a total of $135 million of mainly Chinese artwork, including $27.5 million in contemporary pieces. Despite strong demand, Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Europe and Asia, said in an interview that he expected the surge in prices of Modern and contemporary Chinese paintings to level off. ''The contemporary Chinese art market is no longer massively undervalued,'' he said, adding, ''We've still got some price jumps to come, but I think the jumps will be much less significant now.'' Encore for Movie Hounds In true show-business fashion, two black Labrador retrievers who took their act on the road and became a smash hit have been held over indefinitely. The retrievers, Lucky and Flo, above, lent to Malaysia by the Motion Picture Association of America to sniff out counterfeit DVDs, were originally to stay abroad for a month. Billed as the only dogs in the world trained to detect a chemical used in making the discs, they took part in raids on warehouses, shops and offices that uncovered 1.2 million pirated DVDs and CDs worth nearly $3.5 million. Adding drama and suspense to the dogs' exploits, Malaysian movie pirates have reportedly put bounties on their heads. At the request of the Malaysian government, Lucky and Flo will be based there ''for the foreseeable future,'' said Neil Gane, the motion picture association's senior operations executive.

The previous gallery director at Japan Society, Alexandra Munroe, resigned in April 2005 amid considerable turmoil. After trustees complained about several staff departures and the cancellations of art exhibitions, Frank L. Ellsworth resigned as president of Japan Society in April 2006. He was replaced by Richard J. Wood, who has sought to revive the exhibition schedule. Mr. Earle said in a statement on Monday that he looked forward to building ''a distinctive, durable and popular exhibition program that covers many aspects of Japanese art, both traditional and contemporary.''

Mr. Morgenthau said that three companies controlled by the singer, whose real name is Marco Antonio Muniz, either failed to file tax returns or did not report all taxable income in those years. But he said Mr. Muniz was not prosecuted because he had relied on his brother Bigram Zayes, acting as his general manager, and his accountant, Philip Sarna, to pay taxes, and prosecutors could not prove that he was aware of their failure to pay taxes. Mr. Zayes and Mr. Sarna have pleaded guilty to tax law felonies, and will be sentenced to a conditional discharge after paying back taxes and fines.

Hamas said all the money should be channeled through the Palestinian treasury. In Brussels, the Palestinian finance minister, Salam Fayyad, asked the European Union for $1.3 billion to avert an “acute financial crisis” this year.

But Florentine Films, Mr. Burns's production company, will assemble a team, including a Hispanic producer, to create additional material to run in conjunction with the broadcast, beginning on Sept. 23. The additional material will also be included on the DVD ''The War'' and in any subsequent broadcasts. Hispanic leaders praised the move. Mr. Burns, above right, in the middle of a 20-day promotional tour for his film, said in an interview that while the film was never intended to be encyclopedic or to tell every veteran's story, creating the new material was ''a win-win situation.'' He added that ''for us this was a discussion with an intent to work out the issues.'' The amount of new material has not been decided, he said, but added that he wanted to make sure it did not ''feel pasted on or token.''

2007-04-12T00:00:00Z,"Hamas, the militant group now in a fragile unity government with the rival Fatah faction, criticized a $59 million American aid package authorized earlier this week to bolster Palestinian security measures as ''dirty'' and ''ill intentioned'' because most of the money is to be used to support the Fatah forces of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas said all the money should be channeled through the Palestinian treasury. In Brussels, the Palestinian finance minister, Salam Fayyad, asked the European Union for $1.3 billion to avert an ''acute financial crisis'' this year. The European Union deals with Mr. Fayyad, an internationally respected independent member of the unity government, but boycotts Hamas, which it defines as a terrorist organization. The Union, which suspended direct aid to the Palestinian Authority when Hamas came to power a year ago, said it would not be resumed at this stage. ISABEL KERSHNER"

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Thailand deported a Swiss man after he was given a royal pardon from a 10-year prison sentence for defacing pictures of the king, officials said. Oliver Jufer, a longtime Thai resident, was sentenced two weeks ago after pleading guilty to l&#232;se-majest&#233;, or insulting the monarchy. On Dec. 5, King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#8217;s 79th birthday, surveillance cameras showed Mr. Jufer spraying paint over posters of the monarch in Chiang Mai, where he lived. He had been in prison since then. The rules protecting the revered king are so precise that Thai news media have been largely silent about Mr. Jufer&#8217;s case. It nonetheless shined a spotlight on the l&#232;se-majest&#233; laws. Last week, after a short, amateurish clip that ridiculed the king appeared on YouTube, a video-sharing Web site, Thailand blocked access to the site. That clip was removed, but dozens more quickly went up."

That is, it takes place in an ordinary city -- Glasgow, as it happens -- at the present time. The dire Orwellian warning that Big Brother is watching has evolved from a grim fantasy of totalitarianism into a banal fact of life, in democratic as well as in authoritarian societies. The security cameras fastened on lampposts and the sides of buildings, after all, are put there with our safety in mind, and we have learned to view them with more reassurance than alarm when we notice them at all. It is fitting, then, that Ms. Arnold's interest in the phenomenon of surveillance is less political than psychological. At the center of her film is Jackie (Kate Dickie), who works in a police observation center called City Eye where she sits in front of a wall of video monitors, punching a keyboard and toggling a joystick to pan and zoom across a disjointed panorama of urban life. Jackie is like a moviegoer and, given her ability to edit and refine the images she collects, like a filmmaker as well. Right from the start, then, the director, the heroine and the audience are all implicated in a queasy, curious game of intimate spying."

The man, Taiquan Williams, 25, of Jamaica, was convicted last month of second-degree murder for shooting Eugene McMahon, an employee of the Department of Environmental Protection, as he sat in his department car in Flushing, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Mr. Brown said Mr. McMahon, 46, was supervising a repair when Mr. Williams shot him in the head and stole his wallet."

That's not the initial conclusion to draw from the pictures, whose deadpan manner has long been a problem for many people. They miss the point."

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Nominations for Man Booker International Prize Fifteen authors were named yesterday to the judges' list of contenders for the second Man Booker International Prize. The $118,655 prize, awarded every two years, recognizes a living writer for achievement in fiction published either originally in English or generally available in English. The writers on the list are Chinua Achebe of Nigeria, Margaret Atwood of Canada, John Banville of Ireland, Peter Carey of Australia, Don DeLillo of the United States, Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, Doris Lessing of Britain, Ian McEwan of Britain, Harry Mulisch of the Netherlands, Alice Munro of Canada, Michael Ondaatje of Canada, Amos Oz of Israel, Philip Roth of the United States, Salman Rushdie of Britain and Michel Tournier of France. The winner will be announced in early June. Wordsworth Goes Hip-Hop William Wordsworth has been dead since 1850, but that dude could rap. And to mark the bicentenary of the publication of his poem ''Daffodils'' (''I wander'd lonely as a cloud''), the Cumbria tourist board in England has enlisted modern technology in the form of a pop video and rap version of his poem to peddle the virtues of the Lake District, The Guardian of London reported. Oh, and let's not forget MC Nuts, the zany red squirrel, right, that delivers the rap against scenic backgrounds to convey the idea that it's hip for young people to visit the Lake District National Park this summer. ''Wordsworth's 'Daffodils' poem has remained unchanged for 200 years,'' said a spokeswoman for the tourist board. ''To keep it alive for another two centuries, we want to engage the YouTube generation who go for modern music and amusing video footage on the Web.'' The video can be seen on www.golakes.co.uk/wordsworthrap. Running the Meter In what is billed as a first, the United States and British poet laureates are to give joint poetry readings in Chicago, Washington and London. Sponsored by the Library of Congress, the Poetry Foundation and the Poetry Society of London, the readings by the laureates, Donald Hall of the United States and Andrew Motion of Britain, are to take place in Chicago on May 7, Washington on May 10 and London on June 6. Dickens Park to Open It's nearly time to take the Great Expectations boat ride, frolic in Fagan's den and sample the atmosphere of Newgate Prison. A week from today, Dickens World, above, a $115 million theme park constructed in the naval dockyards in Chatham, England, where Charles Dickens's father once worked, will open to the first of an expected 300,000 annual visitors, Reuters reported. ''If Dickens were alive today, he would probably have built the place himself,'' Ross Hutchins, the manager, said. He said the theme park, depicting a dark, dirty, dank London inhabited by thieves, murderers and ghosts, will have an air of authenticity because it was constructed in consultation with experts from the Dickens Fellowship, a worldwide association of Dickens devotees. In response to critics who speculated that the Artful Dodger, Mr. Pickwick and Uriah Heep might stroll the grounds, 35 miles from London in southeast England, Mr. Hutchins said, ''If we were Disneyfying Dickens we wouldn't be talking to people like the Dickens Fellowship to ensure the correct historical facts.'' 'Kaffir Boy' Banned (Again) The award-winning ''Kaffir Boy,'' Mark Mathabane's 1986 memoir about growing up poor and black during apartheid in South Africa, has been banned from an intermediate school in Burlingame, Calif., after a parent complained about two paragraphs describing men paying hungry boys for sex, The Associated Press reported. An eighth-grade teacher was ordered by Superintendent Sonny Da Marto to stop using the book in her four English classes, although it had been approved by a review committee of parents, teacher, a librarian and a member of the school board. Mr. Da Marto told the Burlingame school board that he would allow an abridged version of ''Kaffir Boy'' to be taught, but that the paragraphs depicting child prostitution were inappropriate for 13- and 14-year-olds. The school board refused to reverse his decision. The American Library Association included ''Kaffir Boy'' on its list of ''Outstanding Books for the College Bound.'' The child rape scene also gave the memoir the No. 31 spot on the association's list of the 100 most frequently banned or challenged books."

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"The National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, unable to find a successor to its music director, Leonard Slatkin, has put off the change for two years. In the interim, the orchestra said yesterday it would turn to Ivan Fischer, right, its principal guest conductor, for leadership. The orchestra will upgrade his title starting in the 2008-9 season to principal conductor and keep him on for an extra year after that. The National Symphony said in November 2004 that Mr. Slatkin would not renew his contract beyond next season, his final year. ''We haven't found the right person yet,'' said Patricia O'Kelly, a symphony spokeswoman. ''These things take time.'' She declined to elaborate. The Philadelphia Orchestra has done something similar, appointing Charles Dutoit as chief conductor while it looks to replace Christoph Eschenbach, who departs as music director after next season. The New York Philharmonic and Chicago Symphony Orchestras are also looking for music directors, suggesting that it is a sellers' market. DANIEL J. WAKIN"

The bill is expected to be signed by the mayor and would go into effect immediately with a retroactive date of September 2005.

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Drawing more viewers than the competition on NBC, ABC, CBS and CW combined, ''American Idol'' led Fox to another dominant night in the ratings Wednesday. The hourlong 9 p.m. show, on which it was announced that Haley Scarnato had become the latest contestant cut from the competition, had 27.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen's estimates. The closest competitor in the hour, CBS's ''Criminal Minds,'' attracted 12.8 million. Fox led earlier in the night among adults 18 to 49 with two episodes of '' 'Til Death,'' one at 8 (7 million) followed by the season finale at 8:30 (8.6 million), although CBS's ''Jericho'' averaged slightly more total viewers in the hour (8.2 million).

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"The New York City Council passed a bill yesterday enhancing whistle-blower laws to protect city employees who report conduct that is harmful to the health, safety or educational welfare of a child. Councilman Robert Jackson said the bill was aimed at protecting teachers from coercion to inflate test scores and those who report the failure of a school to follow through on federally mandated individual education plans for students with special needs. But some critics, including the mayor, say the bill would provide teachers facing poor performance reviews a tool to use against superiors. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn rejected that notion yesterday, saying it would not hamper efforts to bring more accountability to schools. The Departments of Education and Investigation oppose the bill, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has signaled that he would veto it. RAY RIVERA"

Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:45). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'THE ACCOMPLICES' Bernard Weinraub, a former reporter for The New York Times, has chosen a worthy subject for his first play: In 1940, the young Zionist Peter Bergson was determined to persuade the United States government to open its arms to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Unfortunately, this production takes a hagiographic approach to its protagonist, emphasizing his heroism at the expense of more complex characterization. (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (David Ng) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director(1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS' Jack Cummings III directs a respectable if reverential revival of William Inge's last major play. Seeking to access the poetry in Inge's homely tale of troubled lives in the Midwest in the 1920s, he can't quite hide its fundamentally prosaic qualities. Still, this Transport Group production gives audiences a chance to encounter a rarely seen drama from Broadway's heyday (2:35). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'EXITS AND ENTRANCES' Athol Fugard casts a tender glance back at an actor whose dedication to theater helped spark his own in this warm if insubstantial stage memoir. Morlan Higgins capably excavates the emotional core of a role that might have seemed generic, playing an aging gay actor reckoning with the end of an up-and-down career. William Dennis Hurley plays the Fugard stand-in (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE COLOR OF FLESH' Joe Gross's intriguing play features impeccable performances by Amanda Jones, Samantha Ives and Jonathan Kells Phillips as the three corners of a triangle of love and friendship caught up in the French Revolution. It's no ordinary triangle: Ms. Jones plays Marie Antoinette, and Ms. Ives the real portraitist who often painted her (1:30). The 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 254-9533. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'THE NIBROC TRILOGY' ''Last Train to Nibroc,'' ''See Rock City'' and ''Gulf View Drive'' make no mention of 19th-century Russian intellectuals but they do signal the arrival of a talented American playwright, Arlene Hutton. Set in Kentucky and Florida, between the beginning of World War II and the early 1950s, the plays track the life of a young couple whose individual ambitions conflict; they also clash with the goals of a changing American society. Straightforward and heartfelt, but never treacly, the works stand out in a cold, postmodern universe. Try ''See Rock City'' if you have time for only one (1:25, 1:30 and 1:55). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'OUR LEADING LADY' Kate Mulgrew stars as Laura Keene, who was starring in ''Our American Cousin'' on the night Lincoln was shot, in Charles Busch's uneven new comedy. An occasionally lively but mostly lumpen tribute to the glamour and grit of the theatrical life of a past era (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'SERENDIB' David Zellnik's play about a group of scientists observing monkeys in Sri Lanka tackles questions about masculinity and social dominance within a framework that is too cute by half. That said, Mr. Zellnik seems to have more on his mind than many young playwrights (1:55). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 247-4982. (Bellafante) 'SOME MEN' Terrence McNally's hit-and-miss comedy about gay life is a parade of cleanly drawn types, zippy one-liners and sentimental set pieces, woven into a pageant of the ages à la ''Cavalcade,'' Noël Coward's generations-spanning tribute to the British stiff upper lip. Trip Cullman directs the agile, appealing cast (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). B 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ESSENTIAL SELF-DEFENSE' Adam Rapp's new play is a quirky love story about a wholesome but anxious girl (the charming Heather Goldenhersh) and an automaton with a beating heart and a big vocabulary (Paul Sparks, impressively affectless). Dark, zany, entirely mannered and mostly empty (2:15). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) 'PROMETHEUS BOUND' With a splendid performance by David Oyelowo, this is a smart revival of Aeschylus' 2,500-year-old play, rich in poetic imagery. It still has things to say about the abuse of power by an autocratic ruler who vindictively runs roughshod over anyone who disagrees with him (1:20). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Wilborn Hampton) 'TALL GRASS' Brian Harris's three short plays, black farces all, are not nearly as slight as any sound-bite synopsis would have them seem. Here Mr. Harris, a former stock analyst, explores the alliances formed between love and brutality in scenarios in which the tension builds to culminating shock (1:30). The Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante) 'TEA AND SYMPATHY' The specter of the Ted Haggard scandal hangs over the Keen Company's revival of Robert Anderson's 1953 play about life in a psychologically stifling boys' boarding school. Girded by Jonathan Silverstein's skillful, understated direction, the play attains an unexpected timeliness as it evolves into a story about the dangers of sexual repression (2:00). Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Bellafante) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AFTER THE WEDDING' (R, 119 minutes, in Danish) A modern creation with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The canned realism of the Danish director Susanne Bier is strictly Dogme-lite, but the spiky, screen-filling performances of her two male leads, Mads Mikkelsen and Rolf Lassgard, are really something to see. (Manohla Dargis) * 'AIR GUITAR NATION' (R, 82 minutes) Alexandra Lipsitz's breezy competition documentary follows pantomiming would-be rockers as they compete for the right to represent their country in a global championship based in Oulou, Finland. The movement, such as it is, aims to unite a war-torn planet in musical fantasy and to rawwwwwwk! -- but not necessarily in that order. Stylistically, it's nothing special, but the film's droll humor and wild performances are hard to resist. (Matt Zoller Seitz) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) * 'BOY CULTURE' (No rating, 88 minutes) Q. Allan Brocka's absorbing drama follows an emotionally repressed gay hustler (Derek Magyar) as he rebels against the obsessions of his culture -- grooming, cruising, working out -- and a powerful attraction to his roommate. Only when he takes on a reclusive and much older client is he forced to pay attention to a story other than his own. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'DEAD SILENCE' (R, 90 minutes) In this new film from the makers of the ''Saw'' series, a young man (Ryan Kwanten) whose wife was murdered by a demonic ventriloquist's dummy returns to his hometown to unravel the roots of a century-old curse. The film's playfully self-aware touches (like a grand old theater named the Guignol) distract from its leaden pacing, three too many final twists and various behavioral idiocies. (Seitz) 'FIREHOUSE DOG' (PG, 111 minutes) When a pampered Hollywood pooch trades his movie-star lifestyle for a rundown firehouse, it's not long before he is saving a father-son relationship and tracking down a serial arsonist. Yet the movie's wittiest moment -- a canine parody of Dudley Moore's first glimpse of Bo Derek in ''10'' -- will be appreciated only by parents, and in trying to straddle both age groups, ''Firehouse Dog'' proves decidedly less nimble than its furry star. (Catsoulis) 'FIRST SNOW' (R, 101 minutes) Guy Pearce, in his ''Memento'' mode, is a fast-talking salesman in this moody little thriller, which asks metaphysical questions about fate, death and fortunetelling. (Holden) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (A. O. Scott) 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES 2' (R, 89 minutes) Wes Craven's 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes,'' in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. Last year's remake was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up, in which National Guard trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout, is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video. (Seitz) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than the entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'THE LAST MIMZY' (PG, 94 minutes) This overstuffed yet warmhearted sci-fi drama follows a pair of wide-eyed siblings as they solve the riddle of a box from the future. Despite leaden direction (by the New Line Cinema honcho Robert Shaye) and a story crammed with pseudoscientific flotsam -- including palm reading, levitation and telepathy -- this wholesome entertainment doesn't talk down. Nevertheless, a film gazing this far into the future shouldn't be quite so unwilling to look beyond the frame. (Catsoulis) 'THE LOOKOUT' (R, 99 minutes) This directorial debut by the veteran screenwriter Scott Frank (''Out of Sight'') is a variation of an old, old story, about a nobody (a brain-damaged janitor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in with crooks who make him feel like somebody. Although the movie's no masterpiece -- the final stretch feels forced and unconvincing -- there's a lot to like here. (Seitz) 'MEET THE ROBINSONS' (G, 93 minutes) Actually, if you see them coming, run in the other direction. (Scott) 'THE PAGE TURNER' (No rating, 85 minutes, in French) A pretty young thing slithers into the bosom of a bourgeois family like an asp in this shivery little thriller from the French filmmaker Denis Dercourt. Not Chabrol, but not bad, either. (Dargis) * 'PRIDE' (PG, 104 minutes) The Zimbabwean-born filmmaker Sunu Gonera's directorial debut, ''Pride,'' about a swim coach (Terrence Howard, star of ''Hustle & Flow'') leading an urban recreational center's swim team to a championship, about 1971, is a silk ascot wrapped around an ear of corn. But when sinewy young idealists glide through water to the tune of ''I'll Take You There,'' the heart still swells. (Seitz) 'REIGN OVER ME' (R, 124 minutes) Mike Binder's comic drama of post-9/11 grief is wildly uneven -- by turns insightful and grindingly mawkish. Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler are two college buddies who reunite, somewhat improbably, some years after the attacks that robbed one of them of his family. The actors rise above the material, particularly in the longer, looser scenes that allow their contrasting temperaments -- Mr. Cheadle's tense understatement and Mr. Sandler's shaggy emoting -- to find a workable syncopation. (Scott) 'THE TV SET' (R, 87 minutes) Jake Kasdan's knowing satire of network television sends up the neuroses of writers and the ruthlessness of executives with minimal exaggeration. Nothing in this story of a writer (David Duchovny) pursuing his dream project seems implausible, which is less a limitation on the movie's comedy than it is its source. (Scott) 'WHOLE NEW THING' (No rating, 92 minutes) This minutely observed family drama, which tracks the growing pains of a precocious 13-year-old boy in rural Nova Scotia, is the rare film in which the actors playing parents and child feel biologically connected. (Holden) Film Series BEST OF 2006 (Tonight through Thursday) The BAMcinématek offers New York cinephiles the opportunity to catch up with some of last year's best films as determined by IndieWIRE's critics' poll. Tonight there's an advance screening of Julia Loktev's much-praised New York independent film ''Day Night Day Night'' (which will open commercially on May 9). Tomorrow brings the East Coast premiere of ''Il Caimano,'' a political satire by one of Italy's most accomplished active filmmakers, Nanni Moretti (''The Son's Room''), in which an underemployed filmmaker (played by Mr. Moretti's favorite alter ego, Silvio Orlando) agrees to make a flattering biography of Silvio Berlusconi, then Italy's prime minister. Robinson Devor's ''Police Beat,'' on Sunday, is one of the most beautiful and mysterious independent films in recent memory. It's a lyrical account of a Senegalese immigrant who works as a bicycle patrolman in Seattle. ''Climates'' (Tuesday), from the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, is a worthy successor to his 2002 ''Distant,'' with Mr. Ceylan himself interpreting the central role of an egocentric academic whose relationship with an art director is slowly, and largely silently, falling apart. In ''Time to Leave'' (Wednesday), the French filmmaker François Ozon (''Swimming Pool'') looks at the last days of a gay fashion photographer (Melvil Poupaud) dying of cancer. On Thursday there's a preview of Mr. Devor's new feature, ''Zoo,'' a sympathetic portrait of a man who died after having sex with a horse. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) JUBILO (Tonight) Will Rogers's earliest surviving feature film (1919), about a drifter who finds a home on an Oklahoma ranch, gets a rare screening in a print preserved by the Museum of Modern Art. Ben Model provides piano accompaniment. Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) WEST OF THE TRACKS (Wednesday and Thursday) The Chinese documentary filmmaker Wang Bing took three years to capture this sweeping, nine-hour documentary about the transformations worked by encroaching capitalism on an industrial city, Shenyang, in northeastern China. As the aging, unprofitable factories are closed down by a distant government, it gradually becomes clear to the local workers that they have been forgotten in China's rush to riches. The film's three parts -- ''Rust,'' ''Remnants'' and ''Rails'' -- will be shown in rotation through April 24, beginning tonight with ''Rust'' and tomorrow with ''Remnants.'' ''Rails'' will be shown next Friday. Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ART BRUT (Tuesday and Wednesday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $12. (Ben Sisario) JOSEPH ARTHUR (Thursday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's haunting songs, which can float in a gorgeous acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Sisario) * ROSANNE CASH AND ELVIS COSTELLO (Tonight) Rosanne Cash has been a frequent guest at the Rubin Museum of Art, a cozy gallery of Himalayan works in the former Barneys store in Chelsea; she was the first artist to perform in the museum's 144-seat theater three years ago, and has been there five times since. Tonight she is joined by Elvis Costello for an acoustic show on the enigmatic theme of ''Magic Numbers.'' At 7, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; sold out. (Sisario) CUTE IS WHAT WE AIM FOR (Thursday) At some point between Dashboard Confessional and Fall Out Boy, emo's polarity flipped: instead of grand gestures of sincerity, the hallmark of the genre became a verbose, smirky self-awareness. Cute Is What We Aim For, from Buffalo, tries hard to sound witty and effete, but the band falls as short on that front (''Are you perspiring from the irony/Or sweating to these lyrics?'') as it does with its sluggish riffs. With Circa Survive, As Tall as Lions and Envy on the Coast. At 7:30 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) * ROKY ERICKSON AND THE EXPLOSIVES (Tonight and Sunday) One of the godfathers of psychedelic rock, who howled like a werewolf over the flutter of an electric jug in his 1960s band the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson is also one of the most notorious casualties of that era. He spent years in a mental hospital and, despite genuine gifts as a songwriter, has struggled ever since to reclaim his career. At 59, in what his representatives say is his best mental health in many years, he makes what is believed to be his New York debut. Tonight at 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com. Both sold out. (Sisario) THE GOSSIP (Tomorrow) Based in Portland, Ore., but with roots in Arkansas, this trio of two women and one man plays a bare but potent blues-punk, dotting anthems of female empowerment with earthy ''oohs.'' With Chinese Stars and First Nation. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; sold out. (Sisario) PATTY GRIFFIN (Thursday) Patty Griffin may be best known as the songwriter of the Dixie Chicks' ''Let Him Fly'' and ''Truth No. 2.'' But on her own she is more cathartic, with songs that plunge into love as mysticism, desire and faith. Her songs may twang, but they can also cut deep. With Terremoto. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $29 and $39. (Jon Pareles) GUSTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. With Mason Jennings tonight and the Format tomorrow. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; $39 (sold out tomorrow). (Pareles) BUDDY GUY (Tonight) The blues arrive in burst after burst of adrenaline when Mr. Guy plays his songs, full of gut-level belting and speedy guitar curlicues. He makes nearly every excess sound heartfelt. With Danielia Cotton. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $48. (Pareles) HOT CHIP (Thursday) With wobbly electronic rhythms and a strong command of the drippy, semi-ironic disco ballad, this English group plays wistful but still snarky dance music. Get too lost in the beats and you'll miss gags like the oh-so-art-rock countdown of nonsense words in descending size (''S-E-X-I-N-G, C-A-S-I-O, P-O-K-E''). With Tussle. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) ISLEY BROTHERS (Tonight) The Isley Brothers' career spans virtually the entire history of soul music, from their gospel-heated rave-ups of the late '50s and early '60s (''Shout!,'' ''Nobody but Me'') through the slithery funk of the '70s (''It's Your Thing,'' ''That Lady''), all the way to their recent collaborations with R. Kelly. Throughout, the libido has remained as intact as Ronald Isley's falsetto. Opening the show is Sharon Jones, the queen of an active local scene that recreates, spiritedly but not too pedantically, the musky sound of Stax/Volt '60s soul. At 8, United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $39.50 to $69.50. (Sisario) * JANDEK (Tomorrow) A singer, guitarist and occasional keyboardist from Texas, Jandek is also one of the great sphinxes of contemporary American music. Since the late '70s he has released dozens of strange, challenging albums -- his music is a creaky, nightmarish variation of folk-rock -- and maintained an almost total void in place of a public persona. (For years, no one was even sure what he looked like.) Recently he has begun to tour a little, and tomorrow, in a show presented by Tonic, he plays with two veteran underground musicians, the guitarist Tim Foljahn (playing bass) and the drummer Jim White. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 598-0400, henrystreet.org; $20. (Sisario) NORAH JONES (Wednesday) For those who have missed her occasional unannounced gigs at small, no-cover Manhattan bars, in which she wears disguises and does everything from punk to country, Ms. Jones plays a fully official concert at a big, conspicuous place, leading her band in the music that made her famous: gentle, comforting soul-jazz. Opening the show is M. Ward, a gifted singer and guitarist better known for his work as a sideman (Cat Power, Bright Eyes) than for his tasteful and beguiling songs. At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $39.50 to $60. (Sisario) * SALIF KEITA (Thursday) Salif Keita, from Mali, has long been celebrated for a cosmopolitan ear and a voice that can melt hearts, but lately his work has been even more entrancing than usual. His latest album, ''M'Bemba'' (Decca), has songs of love and tribute to ancestors, its acoustic guitars joined by instruments from Hawaii, the Caribbean and even medieval Europe. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $41 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sisario) * KLAXONS, BONDE DO ROLE (Tonight) Klaxons' eerie rave-punk is punctuated by the peal of air-raid sirens and paranoid, shouted lyrics that allude to William S. Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon. How this British band manages to cram in such fear and loathing and still make exhilarating, danceable grooves is what makes it fascinating. With Bonde do Role, a raucous Brazilian trio that makes silly but contagiously high-energy pastiches of electronics and fist-pumping hard rock, à la the early Beastie Boys . At 10, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $12. (Sisario) * THE LOCUST, CATTLE DECAPITATION, DAUGHTERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) If noise-rock had superheroes, the Locust would surely be among them. Not only does this long-running San Diego band have a supreme control of its screamy hurricane of sound -- delivered in quick blasts of guitar, keyboards and indecipherable squeals -- but the group also dresses in skintight insect costumes from head to toe, all the way up to the black mesh over their eyes. (Perfect for Halloween merchandising!) It plays with Cattle Decapitation, a ''deathgrind'' metal band once affiliated with the Locust, and Daughters, a noisy band from Providence, R.I. Tonight at 6:30, Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $15. Tomorrow night at 7, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $12. (Sisario) LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO HALL AND OATES (Tonight and tomorrow night) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring Loser's Lounge series, now 14, both honors and skewers pop greats with cleverly over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Hall and Oates, whose mega-selling soul-pop ranged from the sublime (''She's Gone'') to the farcical (''Portable Radio''). At 7 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) LURA (Tomorrow) A young Cape Verdean singer who was born in Portugal, Lura specializes in bubbly, lilting acoustic songs that are quicker and more danceable -- but no less sensuous -- than the morna tunes popularized by Cesaria Evora. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, worldmusicinstitute.org or symphonyspace.org; $27; $15 for students. (Sisario) PLAIN WHITE T'S (Tuesday) Trite is a strong word, but when it comes to ''Hate (I Really Don't Like You),'' this Chicago power-pop band's irritatingly bland recent radio hit (''Hate is a strong word/But I really, really, really don't like you''), it may not be strong enough. With Boys Night Out, Lovedrug, and Dear and the Headlights. At 8 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) RJD2 (Tonight) As a D.J. and producer, RJD2 -- born R. J. Krohn -- has made a mark in underground hip-hop with productions and remixes for Aceyalone, Aesop Rock and El-P, as well as his collaboration with the rapper Blueprint in Soul Position. He likes crisp funk drum breaks overlaid with brooding chords for a mixture of heft and introspection. With Busdriver and Happy Chichester. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Pareles) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Monday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite '70s rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's repertory includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Krystle Warren. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) Kenny Wayne Shepherd (Wednesday) A 29-year-old blues guitarist inspired equally by the Allman Brothers and Muddy Waters, Mr. Shepherd recently released ''10 Days Out (Blues From the Backroads)'' (Reprise), a CD-DVD package documenting his work with various blues greats, including B. B. King, Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown, Honeyboy Edwards and Etta Baker. Since working on it, several of his collaborators have died, but for this tour he is joined by Hubert Sumlin, Bryan Lee and Buddy Flett. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario) PATTI SMITH (Wednesday) Her first flash of rock 'n' roll brilliance, and maybe still her best, was a cover: Them's ''Gloria,'' transformed from garage-rock swagger into an erotic rhapsody. So Patti Smith's new album, ''Twelve'' (Columbia), with versions of songs by the Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and others, is especially promising. She offers a preview at the Hiro Ballroom. At 7 p.m., 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) UMPHREY'S McGEE (Tonight) One of the few jam bands to gain critical respect in the rock world, Umphrey's McGee, from South Bend, Ind., seamlessly incorporates the irregular meters and gnarled guitar patterns of classic progressive rock into the spoonful-of-sugar textures more common in its milieu, a feat of reconciliation that impresses the connoisseurs and keeps all others on their feet. At 9, Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $26.50. (Sisario) UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. With Copper Kettle. At 7:30 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270, parksidelounge.com. (Sisario) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Rashied Ali has led a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde over the past 40 years, beginning with his role in the late-period work of John Coltrane. His drumming drives this hard-bop band, featuring the trumpeter Jumaane Smith and the tenor saxophonist Lawrence Clark.

(Chinen) STEVE BERESFORD / MICHAEL BATES (Wednesday) Mr. Beresford, a multi-instrumentalist long ensconced in British free-improvisational circles, teams up with the trumpeter Nate Wooley and the drummer Harris Eisenstadt. Then Mr. Bates, a bassist, leads Outside Sources, with Russ Johnson on trumpet, Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone and Jeff Davis on drums. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10.

The pianist Hiromi Uehara also has a new release: ''Time Control'' (Telarc), an audacious jolt of fusion with the core group featured here. (Through April 22.)

(Chinen) E.S.T. / MATTHEW SHIPP (Tomorrow) The initials stand for Esbjorn Svensson Trio, a Swedish jazz-crossover group with an energetic new album called ''Tuesday Wonderland''; taking its lead from Esbjorn Svensson's piano, the ensemble favors somber harmonies and skittering rhythms. Mr. Shipp, in an opening solo piano set, will most likely suggest a darker ideal. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 in advance, $30 tomorrow.

(Chinen) BIRÉLI LAGRÈNE AND GYPSY JAZZ (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Lagrène, a French gypsy guitarist, recently released a double album placing his rhythmically fleet playing in both a solo setting and at the helm of a big band. Here he traffics in the ebullient style of Django Reinhardt, his most famous forebear. (Through April 22.)

(Chinen) * SONNY ROLLINS (Tonight) Last year this tenor saxophonist released ''Sonny, Please'' (Doxy), his best studio recording in more than a decade. Performing his only area concert this year, he leads a trusted band, and presumably will offer searching solos, songbook obscurities and an unsinkable calypso. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $78. (Chinen) * SUN RA ARKESTRA/NUBLU ORCHESTRA (Tonight and Monday) The Sun Ra Arkestra, led by the alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, carries on the boisterous avant-gardism of its cosmic namesake with a ragtag, rhythmic brio. The Nublu Orchestra, conducted by the sagacious Butch Morris, creates a whorl of timbres in the service of groove. The two bands share a bill tonight; Mr. Morris and company perform alone at Nublu on Monday.

(Chinen) * DAVID TORN (Tuesday) Mr. Torn is an inventive guitarist and producer whose new album, ''Prezens'' (ECM), suggests a texturally slippery approach to group improvisation. That has something to do with the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the drummer Tom Rainey, who appear here; but it's also an expression of his gift for organizing sound. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) * VISION TONIC (Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) In response to the sudden closing of Tonic (see John Zorn, below), the Vision Festival has absorbed a few new bookings for an off-season series one block to the east. Sunday's schedule includes a group led by the harpist Zeena Parkins, while Tuesday's will include a rare performance by the Scandinavian trio called the Thing. On Wednesday the alto saxophonist Oliver Lake will perform with the multi-instrumentalist Eugene Chadbourne.

(Chinen) * JOHN ZORN IMPROV (Tonight) Noise is the currency at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of audacious and open-minded musicians. Usually the action has a jubilant tinge, but this happens to be the final night of programming at Tonic, an avant-garde hub that Mr. Zorn helped establish nearly a decade ago. At 7:30 and 9:30, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; donation, $20. (Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera * 'ANDREA CHÉNIER' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Ben Heppner, arguably the leading Wagnerian tenor of our day, continues his bold explorations of far-flung repertory with the title role of Giordano's swashbuckling verismo opera, in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Nicolas Joël's 1996 production. Mr. Heppner may lack the vocal colorings and idiomatic expressivity of the heroic Italian tenors who excelled in this touchstone role, that of a poet with libertarian fervor during the French Revolution. But in his honest and compelling portrayal he sings with burnished sound, vigor and lyrical sensitivity. The rich-voiced soprano Violeta Urmana sings Maddalena for the final performance on Wednesday night, but the popular soprano Aprile Millo takes over the role tomorrow. The stentorian baritone Juan Pons sings Gérard. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $175 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'CURLEW RIVER' (Tonight and tomorrow night) Britten called his one-act opera ''Curlew River'' a church parable. Inspired by a Japanese Noh play, the work takes the form of a sacred ritual, with a procession of monks enacting a mystery play about a madwoman who crosses a river with a ferryman in search of her abducted son. The Japan Society offers a staging of this haunting and seldom-seen work, a co-production with L'Opéra de Rouen/Haute-Normandie. Directed by Yoshi Oida, it stars the tenor Michael Bennett as the madwoman, with musical direction by David Stern. At 7:30, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $52; $45 for members. (Tommasini) 'FLAVIO' (Tomorrow) Candy pink and candy green set the tone for Chas Rader-Shieber's antic production of an opera that consists of arias nestled side by side, bright and sweet as a box of fondants: much of a good thing, leaving a reasonably pleasant aftertaste. On the first night of the City Opera revival, the singers seemed to be fighting to find their pitches: making company debuts are Katherine Rohrer, a light mezzo with a nice tone who didn't quite find her feet on the first note; Gerald Thompson, a promising but sometimes wild countertenor; and the conductor William Lacey, who led a strong, lithe performance. David Walker did a fine job as the foppish, foolish king of the title. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette) * 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The auditorium of the Metropolitan Opera may be too big for Handel. But the cast that has been assembled for the company's revival of ''Giulio Cesare'' is so exceptional that the lack of intimacy does not matter. With a score of astounding richness and variety, the opera emerges as an affecting and psychologically astute masterpiece. With his alluring voice, the countertenor David Daniels excels in the daunting title role. The soprano Ruth Ann Swenson makes a vocally exquisite Cleopatra. Patricia Bardon, a rich-toned Irish mezzo-soprano, brings noble bearing and lyrical elegance to the role of Cornelia. Harry Bicket elicits a surprisingly stylish account of the score from the orchestra. The downside is John Copley's tacky production. At 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Tommasini) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) East-West relations go south in Puccini's famous melodrama. Shu-Ying Li sings Cio-Cio-San, and Christopher Jackson is Lieutenant Pinkerton in this New York City Opera production. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; sold out tomorrow;$25 to $115 for Wednesday. (Bernard Holland) 'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow, Monday and Thursday) For spectacle and big music, the Franco Zeffirelli production of Puccini's final opera, at the Met, is hard to beat. For compelling leads, you might have to look elsewhere: Andrea Gruber sounded wobbly and thin on the first night of this revival, and Richard Margison effortful, though he marshaled his forces for ''Nessun dorma.'' Only Hei-Kyung Hong's Liù, with her reliably floating pianos, was really worth the price of admission. But spectacle and size are evidently enough to keep tickets selling briskly for this one. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Monday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tomorrow and Thursday; $175 tickets remain for Monday. (Midgette) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The last two performances of this new look at the Mozart favorite by the South African director William Kentridge and the Belgian opera house La Monnaie. At 7:30, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $40 to $125. (Holland) Classical Music AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Sunday) Franz Schreker's much-discussed and little-heard opera ''Der Ferne Klang'' is taken up by the enterprising Leon Botstein in this concert performance. At 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $27 to $55. (Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) Nicholas Maw is one of the Chamber Music Society's 2006-7 ''season composers.'' Here the society presents his ''Roman Canticle,'' a setting of Robert Browning's poem ''Two in the Campagna,'' for mezzo-soprano, flute, viola and harp. Angelika Kirchschlager, the mezzo-soprano originally scheduled to perform the work, has been replaced by Peggy Kriha Dye, a soprano. The program also includes Charles Martin Loeffler's ''Quatre Poems'' for voice, viola and piano; Dvorak's Piano Trio in E minor; and Mendelssohn's String Quintet No. 1. Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Vivien Schweitzer) NELSON FREIRE (Thursday) New York audiences experience Mr. Freire's pianism only in glimpses, but this Brazilian returns to the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Bach, Beethoven and Chopin standards, Debussy's ''Children's Corner Suite'' and excerpts from Albéniz's ''Iberia.'' At 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Holland) * OSVALDO GOLIJOV/DAWN UPSHAW YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Tomorrow and Sunday) To foster collaboration between singers and composers, the soprano Dawn Upshaw, through the auspices of Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, has presented joint workshops with leading composers, notably John Harbison in 2004 and Osvaldo Golijov this season. A roster of young composers, paired with young singers, has been collaborating in these workshops for some months, under the guidance of Mr. Golijov and Ms. Upshaw. The resulting works will be presented this weekend in two very affordable programs. Needless to say, each piece will be receiving its world premiere. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15. (Tommasini) KALICHSTEIN-LAREDO-ROBINSON TRIO (Sunday) This venerable piano trio is celebrating its 30th anniversary since making its debut in 1977 at the White House for President Jimmy Carter's inauguration. On Sunday it performs Leon Kirchner's Trio No. 2 and is joined by the violist Pinchas Zukerman for Mozart's Piano Quartet in E flat (K. 493), and by the double bassist Harold Robinson for Schubert's ''Trout'' Quintet. At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $75. (Schweitzer) * OLIVER KNUSSEN (Tonight) This British composer has a significant body of bracing and inventive scores to his credit. But in the last decade or so he has had a woeful record of meeting deadlines for commissioned pieces. An ambitious new work for the pianist Peter Serkin and a large chamber ensemble was supposed to have had its long-awaited premiere tonight at Zankel Hall. Alas, Mr. Knussen was not able to complete the score. In its place he will offer his ''Requiem -- Songs for Sue,'' a New York premiere. The program, featuring Mr. Serkin, the soprano Susan Narucki and the Zankel Band, boosted here to the size of a chamber orchestra, still looks enticing, with works by Messiaen, Magnus Lindberg and Julian Anderson. And Mr. Knussen is an accomplished conductor, which has been one of the problems, actually: his conducting has taken time from his composing. At 7:30, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 and $35. (Tommasini) * KARITA MATTILA (Wednesday) She's been called the leading lyric soprano of her generation -- though that was before she took on ''Fidelio'' and ''Salome'' -- and praised for her lied interpretations, particularly of Finnish song, represented by one set on this thoughtful and wide-ranging concert. The other pieces are Barber's ''Hermit Songs,'' a set of Wolf songs and Turina's ''Poema en Forma de Canciones.'' Martin Katz is the pianist. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $84. (Midgette) NETHERLANDS BACH SOCIETY (Wednesday) The Netherlands Bach Society, a period-instrument ensemble founded in 1921, says it is the oldest early-music group still performing in that country. On Wednesday Jos Van Veldhoven, its artistic director, leads the ensemble and soloists -- including the sopranos Dorothee Mields and Johanette Zomer, the alto Matthew White, the tenor Charles Daniels and the bass Peter Harvey -- in Bach's monumental Mass in B minor. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. (Schweitzer) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Sakari Oramo conducts the orchestra in Sibelius's Sixth Symphony. Lisa Batiashvili is the soloist for Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $79. (Holland) * ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) A new piece by Ingram Marshall is a good reason to go to a concert. Perhaps the only reason Mr. Marshall is not better known is that he's not played more, and the Cheswatyr New Music Initiative, which teamed up with Orpheus and WNYC to commission ''Orphic Memories,'' is doing its bit to change that by ensuring that this piece is played on the orchestra's tour and broadcast. As for the music: think Romantic sensibility and lushness filtered through an electronics sensibility. The conductorless ensemble is adding to the program Gil Shaham in the Beethoven Violin Concerto, as well as Mendelssohn's Sinfonia No. 10. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $88. (Midgette) * POCKET CONCERTOS (Tomorrow) Miller Theater presents the second installment of its innovative Pocket Concertos series, a three-year project commissioning 12 composers to write 12 concertos. The lineup tomorrow features ''Spin 5,'' a five-movement violin piece by Charles Wuorinen performed by Jennifer Koh; ''People Mountain People Sea,'' a cello work by Huang Ruo performed by Jian Wang; Anthony Davis's ''You Have the Right to Remain Silent,'' for clarinet, performed by J. D. Parran; and Sebastian Currier's Piano Concerto, with Emma Tahmizian. Brad Lubman leads the Perspectives Ensemble. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25; $15 for students. (Schweitzer) CHRISTOPHE ROUSSET (Thursday) Call it ''Family Ties'': the concert by this master harpsichordist features music by Louis Couperin and his nephew, the better-known François, and by Johann Sebastian Bach and one of his most famous sons, Carl Philipp Emanuel. François's harpsichord music represents an acme of the French style; Mr. Rousset will play a linked group of five pieces, or ordre, from the last of his four books of collected harpsichord works. From the Bachs, the offerings are the French Suite No. 3 by the father, and the third of the seminal ''Württemberg'' sonatas by the son. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40. (Midgette) * UBS VERBIER FESTIVAL CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Thursday) This chamber orchestra, whose members are chosen from the best current members and alumni of the UBS Verbier Festival Orchestra, will perform Mozart concertos with the first-rate violinist Maxim Vengerov as soloist and conductor. The program includes the Violin Concertos Nos. 2 and 4 (K. 211 and 218), with Mr. Vengerov's own cadenzas, and the Sinfonia Concertante in E flat (K. 364), with the violist Lawrence Power -- repertory this group recently recorded for a new disc on EMI. The concert also includes Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $98.

(Schweitzer) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * AILEY II (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) Alvin Ailey created a second, or junior, company in 1974, almost casually, as a way of working on new choreography. Ailey II is now a world-class troupe, filled with dancers who are not only good but also capable of performing with a youthful hunger for their art, as well as with a reverence for dance that is a part of the mission of the company director, Sylvia Waters, whom Ailey himself chose to direct that first group. Now Ailey II is coming home, performing in the black-box theater that is part of the Ailey headquarters: newer, grander and more gleaming than Ailey ever envisioned. The repertory will include new dances by Abdel Salaam, Darrell Grand Moultrie and Jessica Lang, along with Ailey's ''Streams'' and a chunk of Ailey highlights. (Through April 22.) Tonight and Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, alvinailey.org; $40; $10 student rush tickets available.

PETERSBURG (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) Boris Eifman, one of Russia's most flamboyantly theatrical choreographers, presents an opening gala tonight, with excerpts from six of his ballets and the world premiere of ''Cassandra,'' by the young choreographer Nikita Dmitrievsky.

At 7, Dance Gallery, 30 East 31st Street, Manhattan, (212) 679-0401, nytb.org; $20. (Dunning) * THE NOTHING FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) Tere O'Connor, the organizer of this two-week festival, asked several choreographers and groups to create new works out of nothing, dances with no stories, no music and no outside sources. This week's participants are Douglas Dunn, Hijack, Sam Kim and Dean Moss. (Through April 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20 and $12. (Anderson) PALISSIMO (Tonight through Sunday) Injuries to two cast members forced the postponement of ''Le Petit Mort/Now It's Time to Say Goodbye,'' by Pavel Zustiak. Mr. Zustiak's company is back in business now with a new work that ponders death and confrontations with mortality. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 4 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.

(Dunning) PILAR RIOJA (Today and tomorrow) The doyenne of Spanish dance in New York City will present a program that includes two new works: a stylized flamenco dance called ''Muero Porque No Muero'' (''I die because I can't die''), to music by Surinach, and ''Bamberas,'' whose title refers to a form of folk music that fuses flamenco with traditional Andalusian song to the beat of fandangos. (Through April 22.) Today at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Repertorio Español Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org; $30 to $50. (Dunning) AYNSLEY VANDENBROUCKE MOVEMENT GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) ''And How Should I Begin?,'' a dance of connections and missed connections, takes its inspiration from T. S. Eliot's ''Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,'' but the choreographer says you don't need to know the poem to understand the dance. (Through April 21.) At 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $15. (Anderson) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith) * Chelsea Art Museum: 'DANGEROUS BEAUTY,' through April 21. A somewhat timely update of a well-worn idea, this show of contemporary works in a variety of mediums by 18 artists examines the beauty myth in art, advertising and the fashion industry. Eloquent but blunt imagery of anorexic girls, chiseled male beefcake and close-ups of surgically deformed faces predominates, reminding us of the violent extremes to which some people will go in pursuit of society's ideal of beauty and a designer body. The rest of the show -- often pointing an accusatory finger at skinny models, cosmetic labels and the mass media -- feels familiar in its critique, but the basic premise about the ideology of beauty in our culture is beyond argument. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719, chelseaartmuseum.org. (Benjamin Genocchio) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the layout of the scrapbook as Cartier-Bresson originally organized the pictures. It surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. And it covers an unusually broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) * metropolitan museum of art: 'Venice and the Islamic World, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * El Museo del Barrio: 'The Disappeared (Los Desaparecidos),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter) * Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org (Smith) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'PAINTINGS, FLAGS & IRON: HAITIAN ART FROM THE LAST FIFTY YEARS' This splendid exhibition offers total immersion in the originality and continued vitality of Haiti's self-taught artists. Works by well-known painters like Hector Hyppolite, Toussaint Auguste and Rigaud Benoit range across religion, history and everyday themes. They include still lifes, landscapes and Pierre Joseph Valcin's enthralling rendering of a maternity ward. The forged and welded sculptures of Georges Liautaud and Gabriel Bien-Aimé are on a par with Bill Traylor's antic silhouette drawings. And there are no words for the extravagantly sequined and beaded flags depicting Voodoo spirits and saints, except fabulous. Edward Thorp Gallery, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 691-6565, through April 21. (Smith) * Lamar Peterson Best known for his fanciful, Pop-inflected paintings of African-American suburban life, this young painter smashes that subject to smithereens in his new work, a promising advancement that is already yielding rewards. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com, through April 28. (Cotter) Galleries: Other 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions, like the simple and beautiful wooden flute made in 1999 by Hawk Henires (Nipmuc) and adorned with an elegantly carved bird motif. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, carved bowls and spoons, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, birch bark canoe models, an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, through April 27. (Glueck) * 'THOMAS STRUTH: Making Time' Through the 1990s, the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world's great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, which cannily allows us to look safely at others looking at art, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-probing in the city. Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through April 28. (Genocchio) Last Chance * KRISTIN BAKER: SURGE AND SHADOW In these clever, ambitious mergers of Pop, Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism, abstract painting takes another turn for the spectacular, aided by the freshly white-on-white Deitch space. Cataclysmic compositions and an all-plastic, labor-intensive process strike the eye with a dazzling newness, but the eye adjusts and is eventually bored. A series of smaller studies evades the prescribed soullessness. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Early Chinese Buddhist Sculpture,' Asia Week is over, but its essence lingers on in this exhibition of beautiful carved stone figures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dating from the Northern Wei to Tang periods in China. This is the type of work that elicited rapturous responses when shown in London and Washington a few seasons back. Throckmorton Fine Art, 145 East 57th Street, third floor, (212) 223-1059; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * ANYA KIELAR: 'LADY' The traditions of photomontage, collage and assemblage are sliced, diced and reconfigured here with surgical precision, feminist wit and a terrific sense of light, dark and color. The works range from two to three dimensions, with the best -- mysterious boxed collages that cross Hannah Hoch with Kembra Phaler -- landing squarely in between. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * MOMA: Armando ReverÓn Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Reverón probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, long corridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) WILHELM SASNAL A truncated, slightly altered version of a Polish film from the 1960s provides the frame or caption for often drab, studiously incomplete paintings that reciprocate with hints of cinematic light or depictions of movie screens. A genuine sense of postwar Communist bloc deprivation is evoked, without giving the viewer much to work with. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9663; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'David Shapiro: Rock Iraq,' A while back, David Shapiro filled a gallery with the empty containers of all the consumer products he had bought and used over two years. His current Pierogi solo takes up less space: it's an 8-by-8-foot tabletop model of an imaginary benefit concert. The exact cause espoused isn't stated. But with no musicians present, and corporate logos plastering the concert hall walls, emptiness and waste are the unmistakable themes. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, pierogi2000.com; closes on Monday. (Cotter)"

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"The January issue of Vanity Fair included an article by Christopher Hitchens, ''Why Women Aren't Funny,'' that explored a supposed humor gap between the sexes and in so doing raised the ire of plenty of writers, bloggers and, not surprisingly, funny women. New Yorkers need only head to the West End Theater to find a compelling counterpoint to Mr. Hitchens's essay. There nine red-nosed members of Kendall Cornell's Soon-to-Be-World-Famous Women's Clown Troupe, above, are presenting ''Not Just for Shock Value: A Femmes-Clowns Assemblage.'' The show, presented by Six Figures Theater Company, includes an hour's worth of sketches, dances and satirical scenarios performed by a cast of seriously silly madcaps who have trained under Ms. Cornell. Some vignettes toy with stereotypical male-female roles -- a wife in one scene (Ishah Janssen-Faith) aims to please by baking a pie for her gruff husband (Judi Lewis Ockler) -- only to twist them around and allow the role playing to descend into slapstick madness. Other sketches are darker and are reminders that the greatest clowns try to make people laugh to help stave off existential horrors: in one Ms. Janssen-Faith grapples with an imagined Pandora's box and discovers, as if new, a litany of disastrous events that have befallen humanity. Ms. Cornell, the group's founder and director, is a former dancer and sometime actor who studied under the big-time clowns David Shiner and Philippe Gaulier after first discovering clowning by accident. ''It was like a frying pan on the head,'' she said. ''It just called me.'' To Ms. Cornell men aren't the only ones who can be funny. ''Women can be funny if you let them, and if you look at them differently,'' she said. Ultimately the proof is in the laughter of course.

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Opens today nationwide. Directed by Marcus Nispel 100 minutes All grunting, all goring, the witless action flick ''Pathfinder'' has little to recommend it, though Terrence Malick completists may be interested to know that it rips off a few setups from that master's magnum opus ''The New World.'' The time is the 10th century A.D., ''500 years before Columbus,'' or so it says in some introductory text, and the place is some pastoral if murkily shaded, almost monochromatic, stretch of coast, where native peoples hunt, fish and smile with what's meant to be the wisdom of the ages but registers as cultural cliché."

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"In the world of spies Benjamin Tallmadge couldn't be further from James Bond. He didn't wield sophisticated weapons or drive a gadget-filled Aston Martin, and he most certainly was not a member of Her Majesty's -- or, in this case, His Majesty's -- Secret Service. A real rather than a fictional hero, Tallmadge practiced espionage the (very) old-fashioned way, doing his best to wrest the American colonies from the grip of George III. But Tallmadge (1754-1835), a Long Island native, was still an ingenious fellow, as families will discover tomorrow at the Fraunces Tavern Museum. Revolutionary War re-enactors representing his regiment, the Second Continental Light Dragoons (Tallmadge was an officer as well as George Washington's spy master), will recreate his times. ''The dragoons were the special ops of Washington's army,'' Sal Tarantino, the dragoons' captain, above, said in a phone interview.

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Toward the end of the civil rights movement Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966 in Oakland, Calif. In hindsight the party had a fairly reasonable agenda for social change and the empowerment of African-Americans -- employment, education, decent housing, social justice and political representation -- but it was branded as a shadowy revolutionary organization and a threat to national security. This new exhibition commemorates the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panther Party, bringing together almost 100 photographs of the group's leaders, demonstrations and other activities from about 1967 to 1973 by Stephen Shames, the party's unofficial official photographer. Most of the images are small black-and-white prints, but they have a disquieting, momentous presence. One especially powerful image, above, shows the militant posturing of a pair of Panther security guards (Glen Wheeler, left, and Claudia Grayson) outside a funeral for a slain party member at a church in Oakland in 1971. Mr. Shames photographed not only the public face of the movement but also private moments, including secret meetings of Panther leaders and their home life. Simple but thoughtful, the photographs humanize the group whose driving ambition was equality. (Through May 26, Steven Kasher Gallery, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 212-966-3978, stevenkasher.com.)

2007-04-13T00:00:00Z,"Tony Jaa fans, be warned: there's no kick boxing in this three-day, four-feature minifestival at the Museum of the Moving Image. Instead the main attractions are new films from two of the small crop of Thai directors who have broken into the American art-house circuit in recent years. ''The Unseeable'' (at 8 tonight) is a haunted-house movie, set in 1930s Bangkok, about a pregnant woman who comes to the city to find her baby's father and finds a compound full of ghosts (including the little girl above). It was directed by Wisit Sasanatieng, whose wild cowboy melodrama from 2000, ''Tears of the Black Tiger,'' finally opened here this year. His reference point in ''The Unseeable'' is Japanese horror rather than westerns and martial arts films, and both the plot and the color palette are more restrained than in ''Tears,'' but the aesthetic is similar: less attention is paid to chills and thrills than to the ways in which golden light reflects off the faces of beautiful, frightened women. Pen-ek Ratanaruang's ''Invisible Waves'' (8 p.m. tomorrow) is a companion piece to -- if not a remake of -- his last film, the 2003 ''Last Life in the Universe.'' Once again Tadanobu Asano, the hardest-working man in Asian movies, plays a Japanese slacker with criminal ties, cast adrift in Thailand. (Just to make the connection between the two films more complete his character, now named Kyoji instead of Kenji, again becomes involved with a woman named Noi, though this time she's played by a Korean actress rather than a Thai one.) Where Mr. Sasanatieng is movie-geek over the top, Mr. Ratanaruang is pan-Asian hipster minimalist: a Thai Jim Jarmusch, complete with long, slow takes and melancholy visual jokes. Fans of Haruki Murakami's fiction are likely to appreciate Mr. Ratanaruang's slightly chilly vibe; in ''Invisible Waves'' Kyoji fends off an amorous woman by saying he needs to get back to the sauce simmering on the stove, which could be an homage to Mr. Murakami's spaghetti-cooking heroes. (Tonight through Sunday night, Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.) MIKE HALE"

Mr. Goode had Bach, Mozart and Brahms on his Carnegie Hall program on Thursday night, and Book 2 of the Debussy Préludes came after intermission. In one sense, separate sets of values were at work. In another sense, Bach and Mozart succeeded in the first half for the same reasons Debussy did in the second. Bach's G major Partita can be played on a Hammond organ or an ensemble of kazoos, and it will still sound like Bach. The message supersedes the medium. For Debussy the resources of the piano -- not just the colors but also the possibilities of range and articulation -- are part of the construction process. Without them, everything collapses."

2007-04-14T00:00:00Z,"Having young conductors on the podium of the New York Philharmonic is not as novel as it sometimes seems: It's part of the business of a modern orchestral season, in which guest conductors lead an ensemble for more weeks than its music director does. Lately, the Philharmonic has been visited by a small parade of young but experienced conductors. Often they come with fresh ideas and infectious energy, and in a rational business, any of them might be considered in the search for a successor to Lorin Maazel. But the Philharmonic isn't about youth, freshness or energy. It considers itself entitled to a thoroughly established conductor, if not an elder statesman with a household name. Never mind that across the continent, the Los Angeles Philharmonic was able to excite its audiences this week, seize the national headlines and engender jealousy throughout the orchestra world all at a stroke by snagging the 26-year-old Gustavo Dudamel. Or that the New York Philharmonic's own postwar zenith was its appointment of Leonard Bernstein as music director when he was in his early 30s."

Mr. Arpino, 84, who founded the troupe in 1956 with Robert Joffrey, will take the title of artistic director emeritus on July 1. The Price of Perks Starting this summer, the 750 volunteers at the Tanglewood Summer Music Festival in Lenox, Mass., will be required to donate money as well as time in exchange for free tickets and other perks. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, whose summer home is Tanglewood, is now requiring that volunteers donate at least $75 to its Annual Fund, The Berkshire Eagle reported on Wednesday. The changes reflect the orchestra's growing deficit and the fact that Tanglewood loses ''two to three million dollars a year,'' said Bart Reidy, the orchestra's director of development communications. The orchestra has also said that members of the Boston Symphony Association of Volunteers will receive free lawn tickets to concerts only after they have worked an eight-hour shift, and new restrictions have been placed on how they may use complimentary passes for guests. ''I think it's extortion,'' said Michael Durst of Pittsfield, who has been a Tanglewood volunteer for seven years.

Royal Bank of Scotland, Britain's second-largest bank after HSBC Holdings, teamed up with Banco Santander Central Hispano, Spain's largest bank, and Fortis, a Belgian banking group, and together sent a letter to ABN Amro inviting it to enter ''exploratory talks,'' ABN Amro said Friday. ABN Amro repeated it was in exclusive talks with Barclays but said it would consider the approach ''carefully'' and in line with its responsibilities. Investors and analysts have speculated that a bidding war could break out over ABN Amro ever since Barclays started the discussions last month, proposing a takeover that could be the biggest in the banking industry by valuing ABN Amro at more than $80 billion. ABN Amro, which is based in Amsterdam, started merger talks with Barclays after it came under pressure from hedge funds to either split itself up or to seek a buyer following years of poor share price performance.

2007-04-15T20:24:59Z,"In a March 31st Op-Ed column I critiqued Professor Stephen Prothero's claim (quoted in Time magazine's April 2nd issue) that the ""academic study of religion ... takes the biblical truth claims seriously and yet brackets them for purposes of classroom discussion."" I questioned how anyone could take something seriously by leaving it at the door or putting it on the shelf. And I said that in the absence of its truth claims - claims like salvation is through belief in Jesus Christ who rose from the dead and redeemed us by taking upon himself all our sins - a religion was nothing more than a set of stories and ritual practices bereft of any transcendent meaning of which they would be the expression. You can teach those stories and practices - just as you might teach the stories and practices of baseball (which is, I know, the religion of some people) - but you wouldn't, I insisted, be teaching religion, only its empty shell. Of the hundred or so comments I received, only a few indicated agreement with my point. The others raised a number of objections, and among those objections three were prominent: 1) I fail to understand that one can teach the truth claims of religion as historical and cultural facts without either believing or disbelieving in them: ""To understand the works of Christians such as Chaucer, Dante, Milton or Shakespeare, one must understand something of Christianity. One must not, however, become a Christian."" 2) Teaching the exclusive truth claims of a religion as matters of fact goes against the principles of liberal democracy and liberal education: ""Teaching religious thought as dogma is not education, but theocracy."" 3) What I said in this column is contradicted by what I said in earlier columns: ""The argument you present seems to run counter to your prior claim that any potentially controversial topic can and should be studied within 'academicized' grounds."" First of all, I stipulate to the usefulness of teaching the bible as an aid to the study of literature and history. I'm just saying that when you do that you are teaching religion as a pedagogical resource, not as a distinctive discourse the truth or falsehood of which is a matter of salvation for its adherents. One can of course teach that too; one can, that is, get students to understand that at least some believers hold to their faith in a way that is absolute and exclusionary; in their view nonbelievers have not merely made a mistake - as one might be mistaken about the causes of global warming - they have condemned themselves to eternal perdition. (""I am the way."") What one cannot do - at least under the liberal democratic dispensation - is teach that assertion of an exclusive and absolute truth as anything but someone's opinion; and in many classes that opinion will be rehearsed with at best a sympathetic condescension (""let's hope they grow out of it"") and at worst a condemning ridicule (""even in this day and age, there are benighted people"")."

Since this 53-year-old became the presidential candidate for France’s Socialist Party, opinions have remained divided. “She just looks so bourgeois for someone left-wing,” says Marisa Berenson. The designer Martine Sitbon, on the other hand, finds her “pretty well dressed.” She adds, “By wearing a skirt, she’s avoiding that frumpy trouser-suit look so prevalent amongst female politicians.” The shoe designer Christian Louboutin describes Royal as “physically, great” and someone whose appearance has “dramatically evolved since working for Mitterrand in the 1980s.” Pictures show a rounder person with big glasses and hair untidily tied back. Now it’s cheekbones, chiseled jaw, perfectly coiffed hair and contact lenses. “And two years ago, she replaced her Dracula fangs with caps,” says Lucien Pellat-Finet, the cashmere expert. “In France, we call it the presidential smile.” Terry de Gunzburg, the creator of By Terry cosmetics, is impressed by her “naturally perfect” complexion and how “she never looks tired.” The hairstylist Odile Gilbert refers to her do as “classic,” but because her hair is fine, he says she has no choice. Still, in terms of clothes, Gilbert thinks she could be “more jeans and cool, à la Hillary.” (Hillary cool?) Pellat-Finet is horrified that she favors Paule Ka, the staid French label inspired by Jackie O. He criticizes her red jackets, knee-length skirts and white coats for their “terrible” proportions. Louboutin likens her round-toed shoes to Minnie Mouse’s but appreciates her “terrific legs and ankles.” And apparently the mother of four is a fantasy figure for certain French men, says Louboutin: “They dream of having Ségo as a mother.” [?][?][?]Natasha Fraser"

(Ages 4 to 8) A master of haiku, Issa (born in 1763) wasn’t blessed with an “easy or happy” life, according to the artist’s note at the beginning of this affecting picture book. Karas chose 16 of Issa’s plain-spoken poems and arranged them by season. “Once snows have melted, / the village soon overflows / with friendly children” reads the first. “Here / I’m here — / the snow falling” reads one of the last. The pictures, in muted tones, may work too hard to supply a story — images of a hospital and a graveyard tell us the stooped grandfather from the early pages has passed on — but on the whole they complement the haunting simplicity of Issa’s art."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"FOR a winter that took so long in coming, this one seems to have taken just as long to leave. Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region. From time to time, we have also let the grass go to meadow, so add to that the timothy, ryegrass and patches of clover, along with the knotweed, crabgrass and dandelion, and you've got the rough texture of the common Northeastern lawn."

Eliot Spitzer and his new team are getting ready to put their own stamp on this painfully long-running story. It may be too much to hope for now, but the Spitzer people should try to make any new Javits Center better than just mediocre.

Vonnegut told the New York Times in September 2003, ''What I've said again and again is that if any official from a dogcatcher on up treats you in a way in which is clearly unconstitutional don't call the F.B.I., call the ACLU.''

Jacob, Medinger & Finnegan, Peter A. Cross and Donald C. Farber are deeply saddened by the death of our good friend and client. We send warm wishes to the family. Every experience with Kurt was one that always left us feeling good and laughing, even when he was not happy with the injustices he envisioned in the world around him. Kurt was a profound thinker, a truly sensitive, caring person who empathized with all people, without any consideration of their station in life or where they hailed from. His life and work are an inspiration to all of us. We will miss him very much."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Enough ink has been spilled on this week's politically minded PBS documentary series, ''America at a Crossroads,'' to choke a donkey and an elephant. Less has been said about the Sundance Channel's new environmental set of programs, perhaps because it bears the unfortunate title ''The Green.'' It kicks off this week too, with the premiere of the newsmagazine series ''BIG IDEAS FOR A SMALL PLANET'' and the documentary ''A CRUDE AWAKENING: THE OIL CRASH'' (both Tuesday). In the six-episode first season of the popular British series ''WILD AT HEART'' (BBC America, Saturday), a Cotswolds vet takes his fractious blended family to South Africa on a mission to return a smuggled monkey to the wild and perhaps find some household harmony along the way: ''All Creatures Great and Small'' meets ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' meets ''Daktari.'' Noncynical American families, or animal lovers, who enjoy the show will be pleased to know that the ITV network recently ordered a third season. Paper, pasta, gunpowder, fireworks -- and flowers? The ''Nova'' episode ''FIRST FLOWER'' (PBS, Tuesday) traces the efforts of botanists and geneticists to determine whether China was the birthplace not just of spaghetti and Roman candles but of the first blossoming plant as well. Don't get your hopes too high for a definitive answer, but in the meantime enjoy the absolutely gorgeous scenes shot in the Hengduan Mountains, which are indisputably the home of any number of plants we treasure, including lilies, irises, camellias, primrose and rhododendrons. They can be seen here in wild and riotously colorful forms unknown to the rest of the world. It's what HD was made for."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: While Michael Marissen's article provided challenging food for thought, the decision to run it on Easter morning, the holiest day of the Christian year, was unfortunate. I was saddened but curious to see Mr. Marissen debunk the theory -- which I had been taught in grad school -- that Handel's Old Testament oratorios were patronized by a largely Jewish audience. I wonder, however, in the absence of hard facts, who is served by this information? If the origins of ''Messiah'' are indeed anti-Semitic, it seems safe to say that it has successfully outlived them."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Michael Marissen's article reminded me of Samuel Butler's quote: ''Handel is so great and so simple that no one but a professional musician is unable to understand him.'' Misunderstanding only begins to describe the many faults of Mr. Marissen's analysis. His contention that Handel's work is anti-Semitic is a preposterous leap. Undoubtedly Jennens, an evangelical Christian, participated in the debate of his day between deists and Christians (as common as the debate over global warming today). It is an unsupportable stretch to conclude that because the word ''heathen'' was changed to ''nations,'' Jennens (and Handel) had the Jews in mind. It is much more likely that Jennens meant all of humanity and its sinfulness."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In ''36 Hours; Prague'' (March 25), Evan Rail repeatedly refers to the city and its inhabitants as ''Eastern European,'' which makes me want to point out that Vienna is to the east of Prague, yet hardly anyone would think of ranking Austrians among the Eastern Europeans. True, during the Communist regime, the Czech Republic, then Czechoslovakia, was part of the so-called Eastern Bloc -- part of the Warsaw Treaty indeed -- but both Czechoslovakia and the Warsaw Treaty are now, of course, a thing of the past. The Eastern Bloc term defined a political division that is no longer valid because Europe is becoming one.

Mr. Steets said that the fire was probably caused by a worn-out bushing -- a type of porcelain insulator -- located on top of the transformer. Mr. Steets said one of the transformers will need to be replaced, having sustained considerable damage from the fire. He estimated the cost of a new transformer as $2 million to $3 million. The second transformer was ''slightly damaged'' and will not need to be replaced, according to Mr. Steets."

A few weeks ago, Amazon e-mailed its customers to offer first-day (and bargain-priced) acquisition of this summer's must read, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,'' the seventh and last in the series. As a result, Amazon reported that advance orders were 547 percent higher than for Book 6, published in 2005. Like millions of others, I signed up for mine. But now, I'm having second thoughts. While researching the environmental effects of online shopping, I discovered that e-commerce isn't necessarily a greener way to shop. Indeed, a trip to the local bookstore might be ''cleaner'' than shopping online."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"CRISP--Mary Dent, 83, passed on in her home in Phoenix, AZ on March 24, 2007. Born in Allentown, PA, she was the seventh child of Elizabeth Patch Dent and Harry Dent. Always positive and inspired by the world around her, Mary graduated in 1946 from Oberlin College and in 1948, married William Crisp with whom she reared three children. Mary's passion for this nation and its people led her into politics in which she remained active throughout her life. She began her service as a Deputy Registrar working at a grass roots level and ultimately was elected Republican National Committeewoman in Arizona in 1972 and Secretary of the Republican National Convention in 1976. Mary served as Co-Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1977 until 1980 when, as the last official act of her term, she challenged the GOP's abandonment of the Equal Rights Amendment and their anit-abortion platform in her speech to the national convention. She chaired the Presidential Campaign of John Anderson and served as the National Director of Business Executives for National Security from 1984 through the mid-1990s. Holding principle over politics, Mary graciously and effectively worked during the following decades with members on both sides of the aisle to promote issues of women's freedom, opportunity, choice and peace. Mary was elected to the boards of numerous organizations including the National Political Women's Caucus, National ACLU, National Advocacy Board of Planned Parenthood, Project Vote Smart and the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, and was a founder of the Republican National Coalition for Choice. Admired for her unwavering commitment to her country and a political system she greatly believed in, Mary was featured in numerous books and publications throughout her career. Her memoirs and correspondences are housed in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College. Mary cared deeply about humanity as exhibited by her unique ability to help others see their own goodness, always having time to witness another with her compassion and grace. Well traveled both internationally and nationally, she loved most exploring the wilds of nature with her family, and in particular, hiking the Grand Canyon, which she did for the last time at the age of 69. She returned to live in Arizona in 2005. Mary Dent Crisp is survived by her son, William Dent Crisp, two daughters, Barbara Crisp and Anne Crisp of Phoenix, two grandchildren, Brian and Jessica Crisp, her brother Richard Dent of Schnecksville, PA, her sister Jesse Dent Cook of Arlington, VA, many nieces and nephews, and her companion, William Tayler. She is predeceased by her sister Jane and her four brothers Hal, Charlie, Jack and Pete.

I didn't do it because I was a great athlete; I didn't even play high school sports. I've coached because a lot of the coaching I saw when my oldest was starting out was very bad. I've found it hard to do well, and rarely do I feel I've achieved the right balance. It's fine to say winning doesn't matter, but try losing every game, as I did one year in our town basketball league. Kids lose interest. When you see the parents in town, you feel you owe them an explanation. (''That team we played last night was so stacked.'') The joy goes out of the game and the players do, too.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"AMERICAN orchestras have historically been hidebound institutions afraid of alienating mainstream subscribers. Boards tend to hire the most renowned maestros they can attract and afford: sure bets, in other words, safe investments. And many orchestras are weighted down with the burden of having to be the public face of a city's higher cultural aspirations. In recent decades even some great conductors driven by lofty artistic principles have unwittingly contributed to the perception that orchestras are elitist. When Kurt Masur, during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic, faced criticism that the orchestra was loath to take risks, he often answered that, yes, yes, we should play new music and be more adventurous. But then he would grow misty-eyed and speak of the Philharmonic's sacred responsibility to maintain the timeless Germanic masterpieces from Mozart through Bruckner. It was impossible not to be affected by his passion. Sadly, it was also clear that such an Old World attitude was an impediment to change."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"''If I could get my hands on Sarkozy, I'd kill him.'' I had asked Mamadou, a wiry young man wearing gray camouflage pants and a tank top, what he thought of France's former minister of the interior, who is also the right's standard-bearer in this spring's presidential elections. ''I'd kill him,'' he continued and then paused as if savoring the thought. ''Then I'd go to prison. And when I got out, I'd be a hero.''"
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"MOROCCO The News -- Three terrorism suspects implicated in the bombing of an Internet cafe in Casablanca blew themselves up on Tuesday as the police closed in, and a fourth suspect was shot as he tried to detonate a bomb. Behind the News -- The police said its investigation into the March 11 cafe bombing, which killed the bomber and four others, led them to the four men and to a wider plot to attack the port in Casablanca, as well as the police and tourist sites. The bombing rattled the country, which in 2003 was hit by five suicide bombings that killed 45 people. The police responded then by arresting thousands of reputed militants, including some accused of conspiring with Al Qaeda. EUROPE The News -- The European Union is considering expanding the powers of Europol, its law enforcement agency, to enhance its ability to fight terrorism. Behind the News -- The proposals, taken up at a hearing of the European Parliament last week, would extend the agency's mandate to criminal issues that are not strictly related to organized crime, and grant it greater access to data on people under investigation. The hearing coincided with the release of a report by Europol, which said that more than 700 people were arrested for terrorism-related offenses in the union's 27 nations in 2006, with half of those arrests involving threats from Islamic extremists. ALGERIA The News -- Two bombs targeting the Algerian prime minister's office and a police station killed at least 33 people and injured more than 200 on Wednesday. Al Qaeda's wing in North Africa claimed responsibility. Behind the News -- The suicide attacks in Algiers, the capital, were the deadliest in more than a decade and followed warnings by officials in the United States and Europe that Algeria was becoming a center for terrorism that could threaten Europe and North America. The group claiming responsibility, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is North Africa's most active terrorist group and seeks to establish an Islamic theocracy throughout the region. AFGHANISTAN The News -- With fears of a new Taliban offensive, officials from the United States and allied countries met in Canada to discuss a long-term strategy for Afghanistan. Behind the News -- The United States, with about 26,000 troops there, hopes to clear southern Afghan regions of fighters for the Taliban and Al Qaeda and follow with rapid investments in infrastructure in what is expected to be a long struggle to stabilize the country. Military officials were preparing for an offensive by Taliban and Al Qaeda forces that is likely to focus on hit-and-run attacks, suicide bombings and roadside explosives that have been used with such punishing effect in Iraq. PAKISTAN The News -- Pakistan's generals say they have reclaimed some control of tribal areas bordering Afghanistan from foreign militants aligned with Al Qaeda. Behind the News -- President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan said the army had joined tribal leaders in the fighting and had killed nearly 300 militants, though other officials say the number was much lower. Pakistan has been under heavy pressure from the United States to clear the tribal areas of militants -- mainly Uzbeks and other Central Asians who have been waging an insurgency in Afghanistan. Officials acknowledged that hundreds of foreign militants remain, probably including Osama bin Laden."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Re ''The Times's Picture of TV Viewing Is Fuzzier Than It Appears'' (April 8): The claim by Nielsen Media Research that it ''lacks 'the resources' to calculate the margin of error on the 'hundreds of rating numbers a week' '' sounds pretty fishy to me. Based on my recollection of Statistics 101, the margin of error should be easy to calculate from just a few key numbers, and any cheap computer would make short work of even hundreds of rating numbers."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Best known for his buzzed bob, Christiaan Houtenbos worked with everyone from Grace Jones to Calvin Klein in the 1980s. He was also a famously bad boy, once clipping a chunk of hair from an unsuspecting fashion editor's head. Though cutting back on hours, he's still got the best photographers wrapped around his curling iron. Is your work art? It is for me. Hair is the flag of the soul. Does your hair change? All the time. I often shave my head, and the hair grows back with different patterns buzzed into it. What about your style? I wear orange underpants every day. Is there life outside of hair? I love ceramics, landscape architecture and poetry. I also take lots of photos. When I compile 86,400 images, I will make a clock with a different picture every second for 24 hours. Armand Limnander"
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"The Yankees lead the majors in errors, with 13 in their first 10 games. Their starting rotation is depleted by injuries, and their bullpen is exhausted. But they are always a threat to change a close game with one swing. It happened Saturday at the Coliseum, when Jason Giambi belted a home run to right center off Lenny DiNardo in the 13th inning, leading the Yankees to a 4-3 victory over the Oakland Athletics."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"One glance at any magazine, billboard or department-store window makes it clear: shoppers are swimming in a sea of green. No longer confined to Phish concerts or food co-ops, eco-friendly clothing now caters to both taste and conscience, as major designers find more inventive, and more stylish, ways to love the earth. (Vegetable dyes are so '96.) But companies have different ways of defining green, and many slap on the natural label because it's in vogue. So it's wise to do your research. Here are nine items from brands striving to save the planet, one bamboo fiber at a time. ELLEN CARPENTER 1. The Pasadena dress by Loyale blends organic cotton and hemp in a vintage-inspired design ($185 at Organic Avenue in New York; 212-334-4593). 2. This elegant Icarus top by Linda Loudermilk is made of lyocell, a biodegradable fabric derived from wood pulp ($299 at Kaight in New York, 212-680-5630). 3. Vinyl billboards bound for landfills find new life in one-of-a-kind bags by Vy & El, like this hip and sophisticated attaché case ($187 at thegreenloop.com). 4. Patrol sneakers by Patagonia have hemp uppers, partly recycled rubber soles and a collapsible leather heel, which converts them into a comfortable slide ($85; more colors -- this one is ember -- and a men's version available at Patagonia.com). 5. For every purchase of silver bangles by John Hardy, bamboo seedlings are planted on a deforested island off Bali ($95 each at sustainableadvertising.org). 6. Mauri Pioppo uses recycled gold for her delicate LiveGreen necklace and donates 30 percent of all proceeds to the Natural Resources Defense Council ($365 at mauripioppo.com). 7. This pointelle hoodie from the New York company Panda Snack is made from bamboo, a highly renewable material, which doesn't require pesticides to thrive ($84 at Kaight). 8. These summery, cuffed capri jeans from Levi's Eco line are 100 percent organic cotton and washed in natural dyes ($70 at select Levi's flagship stores). 9. This itsy-bitsy string bikini by Anna Cohen is recycled, made from leftover scraps of fabric that were used to create Olympic speed-skater uniforms ($164 at btcelements.com)."

Mr. Taride does not have to pay to live there through June 2011, and he also does not have to pay any taxes on that benefit."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"HARTFORD now has the only fuel cell bus operating east of the Rocky Mountains, a zero-emission vehicle that is among a few dozen running anywhere in the world. The bus represents an important milestone on a municipal mass transit stage that is increasingly mindful of global warming and other pollution issues. But at $2 million, it is unclear whether it is cost effective. The price is nearly six times the cost of each of the 650 full-size conventional diesel buses running in Connecticut and $1.5 million more than each of two diesel hybrid buses that have been running in Stamford. ''That's the $64,000 question,'' said Michael A. Sanders, public transit administrator for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. ''There's a benefit to having no emission from a tailpipe, but it's not worth a million and a half to me.''"
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Some were wounded by would-be assassins, others hospitalized with diseases or broken bones. The list of governors who have been sidelined is long. But more often than not, their time off the job was not. ''There's not a lot of precedent for governors being taken out of office for being incapacitated,'' said Christopher Cashman, a spokesman for the National Governors Association."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I disagree with Caroline Weber's assessment, in her review of ''Nancy Cunard,'' by Lois Gordon (April 1), that Cunard was a ''supporter of the disenfranchised.'' Weber failed to point out that Henry Crowder, the African-American jazz pianist she fell in love with and lived with, was a married man. There is nothing worthwhile when a white woman takes a good man away from a ''sister.'' Nancy Cunard had plenty of pickings and her choice of Crowder was cruel and thoughtless.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Dance will be jumping through both stages of Symphony Space. In the Peter Jay Sharp Theater the muscular men of LES BALLETS GRANDIVA will put on ballerinas' tutus for some pointed comic looks at the conventions of classical ballet. But there will be more than sight gags, as the troupe hopes to unite technical precision with theatrical flair. Over in the intimate Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater, as part of the Gender Benders series, which features sometimes serious and sometimes lighthearted explorations of the sexes, two groups share a program. MONICA BILL BARNES & COMPANY examines contemporary issues facing women. NICOLAS LEICHTER DANCE presents dancers in pairings that are also culture clashes. Grandiva, Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.; $21 to $26, $15 for students and 65+. Barnes and Leichter troupes , Thursday through Saturday at 8:30 p.m.; $21 in advance, $25 day of performance. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org. Two new productions by LES BALLETS JAZZ DE MONTRÉAL will demonstrate that ballet can involve more than the five traditional positions and that jazz can mean different things in different countries. ''Mapa,'' by the Brazilian choreographer Rodrigo Pederneiras, unites Brazilian dance forms and rhythms with classical ballet. Azure Barton's ''Chambres de Jacques'' dances its way through both Vivaldi arias and folk songs from Quebec. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., next Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org, $40. Nothing's coming to Dance Theater Workshop, but that may be cause for rejoicing, for this nothing is really something. It's the two-week NOTHING FESTIVAL organized by Tere O'Connor, who asked various choreographers and groups to create premieres totally from scratch with no stories, no music and no outside sources. This week's participants are Douglas Dunn, Hijack, Sam Kim and Dean Moss. (Other dancers perform April 25-28.) Wednesday through Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20, $12 students and 65+."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"THE dance routines have lost some of their Hollywood gloss, and occasionally a hormone-hijacked voice threatens to derail a duet. But herds of young actors have been saying the same thing since last fall, when Disney's ''High School Musical'' started hurtling into school drama departments: The show is unstoppable. The TV movie that set off a million adolescent singalongs before its soundtrack went on to become the biggest-selling album of last year is currently rah-rah-ing its way across more than 1,300 school stages worldwide, according to Disney officials; more than 100 of them are in elementary, middle and high schools in the suburbs around New York."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Senator John McCain said that the buildup of American forces in Iraq represented the only viable option to avoid failure in Iraq and that he had yet to identify an effective fallback if the current strategy failed. ''I have no Plan B,'' Mr. McCain said in an interview. ''If I saw that doomsday scenario evolving, then I would try to come up with one. But I cannot give you a good alternative because if I had a good alternative, maybe we could consider it now.''"
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, by Malcolm Gladwell. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.99.) Gladwell's best-selling first book, ''The Tipping Point,'' argued that small actions can ignite positive social change; ''Blink,'' a paean to the power of first impressions, makes the case for ''thin-slicing.'' There is, Gladwell suggests, a subconscious process through which we sift huge amounts of information, isolate telling details and come to rapid conclusions, even in the first two seconds of seeing something. '' 'Blink' is a book about those first two seconds,'' he writes. The book moves through dozens of stories about thin-slicing, from a Pentagon war game to New Coke, which tested well but flopped in the marketplace. Gladwell ''has us flying around the world and across disciplines at hectic speed, and he's always dazzling us with fascinating information and phenomena,'' David Brooks wrote in the Book Review. THE EAGLE'S THRONE, by Carlos Fuentes. Translated by Kristina Cordero. (Random House, $15.95.) The spirit of both Machiavelli and ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' hovers over the down-and-dirty politics of this skillfully translated epistolary novel, set in 2020, when Mexico's presidency -- the ''eagle's throne'' -- is soon to come up for grabs. Our reviewer, Terrence Rafferty, called ''The Eagle's Throne'' the ''most wickedly entertaining novel of Fuentes's career.'' UNCENTERING THE EARTH: Copernicus and ''The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres,'' by William T. Vollmann. (Atlas/Norton, $15.95.) Nicolaus Copernicus died in 1543 -- the same year his infamous book, ''The Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres,'' was published in Nuremberg, announcing that the Earth revolved around the Sun. In ''Uncentering the Earth,'' Vollmann, the author of ''Europe Central'' (winner of the 2005 National Book Award for fiction), subjects Copernicus's dense, technical treatise to a close analysis. ABSOLUTE CONVICTIONS: My Father, a City, and the Conflict That Divided America, by Eyal Press. (Picador, $15.) Press, the son of a gynecologist in Buffalo, provides a balanced social history of the city's abortion wars of the 1980s and '90s in an effort to explain the murder of one of his father's colleagues, who was killed in 1998 by an anti-abortion activist.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"AS Washington tussles over the fate of the nation's estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants, municipal governments are taking sides. Places like Morristown, N.J., and Danbury are cracking down. Others, like New Haven and New York City, are embracing their undocumented workers. City councils can't change the federal government's failed immigration policies, but they can choose whether to offset or intensify the damage. According to the Migration Policy Institute at New York University, United States municipalities passed 34 laws last year tightening the screws on undocumented immigrants; 56 more such measures are pending."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"A table last Sunday with a report on executive pay referred incorrectly to equity holdings of Michael L. Eskew, chief executive of United Parcel Service. Their total value, though listed at $535,010,884, included $514.5 million in shares he does not own; they are held in trusts he helps to control on behalf of the company. He owned $17.7 million in shares outright. The table also misstated the value of equity holdings of Glenn A. Britt, C.E.O. of Time Warner Cable. It was $10.5 million, not $25.8 million."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"The recent controversy over allowing severely emaciated girls to walk the fashion runways was mostly played out in letters to the editor and in designer caucuses behind closed doors.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"KOENIG--Richard. I regret to announce the death of Richard Koenig, Controller of the American Branch of the Cambridge University Press from 1969 to 1985. He died March 10th after a battle with cancer. A resident of Deerfield Beach, Florida, Richard was 87. He was a man of great wit and wisdom acquired over a life well lived. Richard was born in 1920 in Vienna, Austria and escaped as a young man in his late teens from the Nazi persecution. He was a passenger on the last ship out of Europe before the outbreak of World War II. He landed in New York in 1939 on the day war was declared in Europe without knowing a single person in the entire country and with four dollars in his pocket. He described spending the final night on the ship's deck and being rewarded in the morning with ''one of the most magnificent sights I have ever seen: the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan slowly emerging out of the darkness and mist, first as very faint silhouettes that seemed to change shape every few seconds and finally as buildings that appeared to grow out of the water.'' Having secured the promise of a job in Los Angeles before leaving Europe, Richard traveled by bus from New York to Los Angeles on a route that wound through Arizona and New Mexico to San Diego and then up the coast to Los Angeles. He described the journey as ''hot, uncomfortable and magnificent.'' Richard loved his adopted country and returned to New York by about 1945. He worked in publishing for the rest of his working life; first with Viking Press, then New American Library, Walker & Company and finally Cambridge University Press. Richard is survived by friends and colleagues at Cambridge who were honored to have known him and who will never forget this remarkable man."

Even after the snow and ice were gone, winter's residue could still be found spread across the grass in the powdery leaves and twigs, the dirt shoved by the snowplow up onto the lawn, and all the other bits of dust it left in its wake. Our lawn is an uneven place to begin with. It is a combination of the broad, deep-green blades of Kentucky bluegrass and the thinner blades of fine fescue, a typical mix in this region.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Jens mortensen; Courtesy of La Shed Du Fred; courtesy of Laura Davidson Public RelationsFor a superstar hairstylist, Orlando Pita is as modest as a shampoo girl's tips. You won't find him bragging about Madonna, Gwyneth, Tilda and Naomi. And he's way too laid-back to boast about how many fashion shows and ad campaigns he's hot-rollered in the more than 20 years he's been at the top of the game. But there's nothing casual about how he approaches his work. ''I'm a stickler for perfection,'' Pita says, ''although of course, sometimes, perfection can be a perfect mess.'' 2. Between his many photo shoots and runway shows, a consulting gig for L'Oréal and the private clients he coifs at his minimal-chic downtown salon (Orlo, 34 Gansevoort Street; 212-242-3266), Pita rarely lets his hair down. But whenever he can, he and his partner, George Casson, retreat to Cotton House hotel, on the tiny Caribbean island of Mustique. ''My life is so crowded and social that when I get a week off, I prefer remote places.'' Go to www.cottonhouseresort.com. 3. For peace and quiet within driving distance, Pita and Casson shack up in their new country house on the Delaware River in Callicoon, N.Y. ''I love being on the water, and upstate is more me than Long Island,'' he says. The pair frequent the local home-furnishings shop La Shed Du Fred, for gifts, candles, and furniture and accessories by local artisans. Go to www.lasheddufred.com. 4. His most prized haircutting tool -- a vintage feather razor -- was a gift from a close friend. ''I like to use a razor the old-fashioned way, like scissors, to actually cut the hair, not just thin it.'' Similar razors can be found at www.classicshaving.com. 5. Pita's promoting platinum for spring. ''I think bold colors are in, and platinum is the boldest blond you can have,'' he says. ''Obviously, it's not for everyone. You have to be committed.'' Andre Viveiros, Orlo's celebrity colorist, adds, ''Platinum is modern if it's on the cool side, and not too golden.'' The supe du jour, Agyness Deyn, shown here, has the perfect hue. 6. The stylist goes through cases of Kérastase Résistance Double Force hair spray -- $32 at Orlo -- during show season. ''It's a great way to add texture to hair, especially the cropped cut I've been doing lately,'' Pita says. ''I spray it all over in sections and then brush it out. And I always run my fingers through the hair after I spray it.'' 7. His favorite secret address in Paris isn't a trendy boutique or scenester haunt. It's BVH, a department store at 14, rue de Temple, where le sous-sol, the basement hardware and crafts section, is creatively stocked. ''I'll go there two or three times for inspiration during Paris fashion week,'' he says. ''You can find amazing things -- great skins, shoe-mending supplies, chains, laces.'' He used materials he found there to make these hand-cut and hand-lacquered barrettes for John Galliano's fall 2007 Dior runway. 8. His favorite restaurant, Knickerbocker Bar and Grill (33 University Place), isn't exactly teeming with fashion types. ''People don't expect me to like a place like this, but when I take them there, they become instant converts. It's very neighborhood-y, and I'm obsessed with the short ribs.'' 9. As for his own wavy locks? Pita suds up with L'Oréal Vive Pro Nutri Gloss shampoo ($5 at Target). ''It's light but nourishing and leaves my hair really shiny. You don't need to use a lot, and I can even get by without conditioner.'' 10. Orlo clients are smitten with the Bespoke Labs T3 Overnight hair dryer ($130). ''I've never seen a travel dryer this good. It's tiny, folds up, has dual voltage and is as powerful as a full-size model.'' ."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"We have always been slightly uneasy - notwithstanding our growing cultural obsession with youth and physical perfection - about the enormous value we assign to female physiognomy, based as it is on nothing more substantive than an undemocratic rolling of the genetic dice. Clearly, although we have all been bequeathed a more or less similar arrangement of facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, neck, skin), there are some women who emerge, either by way of felicitous lineage or a hazard of good fortune, with mugs to die for. Audrey Hepburn. Vivien Leigh. Grace Kelly. Julie Christie. Julia Roberts. Halle Berry. Penélope Cruz. The variations may range from the gamine to the sultry, the classic to the exotic -- stopping along the way for the slightly more Nordic look that often goes with blond lovelies -- but the theme is the same. They are undeniably beautiful; we, by and large, however attractive or striking, are not. This tragic and unearned differential (one that is becoming ever more tragic in a ''looksist'' society) has led us to devise ways of minimizing beauty's importance with dispassionate abstractions or consoling, somewhat grandmotherly mantras. If you want to get high-minded about it, you can clutch for solace at the conjecture of the 18th-century philosopher David Hume that beauty ''exists merely in the mind . . . and each mind perceives a different beauty'' and hope that no one will notice that this observation, if it ever held up, preceded the invention of photography. Closer at hand is the adage ''Beauty is as beauty does,'' which is the kind of snippy comment Mary Poppins might have made if she came upon one of her charges preening before his or her reflection. Then there is the old platitude ''Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,'' which attempts a similar leveling of the playing field."

KARITA MATTILA, the immensely gifted soprano, gives a Carnegie Hall recital featuring an eclectic and offbeat program. The composers include Barber, Wolf, Turina, Kuula, Melartin and Granados. Wednesday at 8 p.m.; $25 to $84. The Metropolitan Opera will offer a grand reunion: the three one-act operas by Puccini written to be performed as ''IL TRITTICO,'' but more often done separately. They consist of ''Il Tabarro,'' a dark piece of grand guignol; the bittersweet ''Suor Angelica''; and the light, slightly acerbic ''Gianni Schicchi,'' with that beloved excerpt aria ''O mio babbino caro.'' This new production was created by Jack O'Brien, the Broadway director behind ''Hairspray.'' Maria Guleghina and Salvatore Licitra sing in ''Tabarro''; Barbara Frittoli portrays the ill-fated Sister Angelica; and Alessandro Corbelli sings that rascal Schicchi. James Levine conducts.

Audiences can share the feeling: a drink called a Tuppertini is sold at the bar. And at select performances ticket holders vie for sandwich holders in a raffle.

''AMERICAN FIESTA,'' now in previews at the Vineyard Theater, takes a step up the socioeconomic culinary-metaphor scale by offering Fiestaware -- the brightly colored table ceramics beloved of collectors -- as a way of looking at the divide between red and blue states. Written and performed by Steven Tomlinson, the play also concerns divisions within Mr. Tomlinson's own family over his plan to marry his male partner.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"A reader writes, ''God may be invoked because the explanatory power of science ultimately breaks down, leaving a vacuum that must be filled'' (Letters, April 1, in response to ''Darwin's God,'' by Robin Marantz Henig, March 4). But why should God be invoked in the face of the unknown? Is it not enough to say, ''I don't know''? Imagining supernatural answers precludes the possibility of finding verifiable answers. This makes God and ignorance synonymous."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"JOE GRECO lives with his wife, Karla, and their two children in a recently built four-bedroom home in a small hamlet in Suffolk County. Although he does not consider himself a wealthy man, Mr. Greco has joined a growing number of taxpayers across the region who find themselves paying the alternative minimum tax, which was created almost 40 years ago to make sure the nation's millionaires paid their fair share. ''So, I earn a decent salary,'' said Mr. Greco, 41, of St. James, who makes about $150,000 a year running a ready-mix concrete business with his father and brother. ''But my property taxes are astronomical, well into five figures. And my state income taxes are also five figures. But if you make enough to pay them, you can't deduct them.''"

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"FOR years I've coached my kids' teams -- my three sons' baseball and basketball teams, my daughter's softball team. I didn't do it because I was a great athlete; I didn't even play high school sports. I've coached because a lot of the coaching I saw when my oldest was starting out was very bad. I've found it hard to do well, and rarely do I feel I've achieved the right balance. It's fine to say winning doesn't matter, but try losing every game, as I did one year in our town basketball league. Kids lose interest. When you see the parents in town, you feel you owe them an explanation. (''That team we played last night was so stacked.'') The joy goes out of the game and the players do, too. In their overprogrammed lives, the 0-8 basketball team falls to the bottom of the list."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Ben Wallace-Wells's article (April 1) was informative. Senator Obama comes across as a fresh face, and David Axelrod seems to have guided him well. The roughness of the political game was reflected in the story of Senator Clinton's important work for children like David Axelrod's son -- work that, Axelrod's wife, Susan, said, was ''one of the most important things anyone has done for epilepsy.'' And yet David Axelrod is now ''dedicated to derailing this woman's career.''"

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Recently, as I lay naked below the waist while a stranger spread hot wax on my nether regions, I began to think about trust. Like most New Yorkers, I am wary of strangers -- even friends. If the woman telling me to flip over and spread my cheeks had tried to talk to me on the street, I wouldn't have made eye contact. And yet here we were, making tiny talk as she eyed my bikini line to make sure it was symmetrical. In 15 minutes, she'd be determining the sexual fate of yet another woman willing to pay to suspend suspicion in order to be pretty. How did we get here?"

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"DUNBAR--Judge Gerald J., Civil Court Judge. The Honorable Gerald J. Dunbar, a judge in the Civil Court of the City of New York, died Thursday April 12 in New York Methodist Hospital after a short and sudden illness. Born in Peoria, Illinois, January 15, 1947 and raised in Buffalo, Judge Dunbar came to New York City as a teenager to attend New York University and stayed to become a prominent attorney in Brooklyn before winning his judgeship in a city-wide election in November 2005. Prior to taking his seat on the bench, Judge Dunbar was a partner in the Brooklyn law firm of Tenenbaum, Dunbar and Berger. Earlier he was in independent practice in Brooklyn and Manhattan. His specialties as an attorney included labor law, landlord/tenant law and election law. A lifelong supporter of liberal causes and reform politics, he was well known in Brooklyn as a legal advisor to reform candidates who often challenged the Kings County political establishment. Judge Dunbar lived in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn with his wife Christine Pasquariello, a physician and former attorney. They met when both were students at Brooklyn Law School and were married in 1990. In addition to a bachelor's degree from NYU, Judge Dunbar earned a juris doctor degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1974 and a masters of law in labor law from NYU Law School in 1975. He was predeceased by his mother, Marie Dunbar, and father, Gerald Dunbar. Family and friends are planning a memorial service to celebrate his life."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Hard, brittle beats. Noisy new-wave grooves. A preening, party-obsessed lead singer. In many ways the duo GHOSTLAND OBSERVATORY from Austin, Tex., seems like an old-fashioned band, eager to recreate the sights and sounds of an earlier era. In this case that earlier era is 2002. Back then partyers and journalists were talking about a playful club scene sometimes known as electroclash, although the term came to be used as a punch line: a ridiculous name for a ridiculous scene that seemed to disappear as soon as it (noisily) arrived. But like many ridiculous pop-culture phenomena before it, electroclash has proved remarkably durable. The demand for danceable new music is, as economists would say, inelastic, and Ghostland Observatory has figured out a way -- hammy but apparently effective -- to satisfy it. The duo has built a cult following the even-older-fashioned way: through raucous live shows. Expect one Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom. 8 p.m., 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"I would not deny poor people the satisfaction that comes with effective money management and savings (Rachel Louise Snyder, April 1). But I see little to celebrate in America Saves, where the daily deprivation of what most Americans take for granted (sweets and bread, for example) is necessary for a minimum-wage earner to accumulate even a small savings account. What kind of security can those meager savings buy for such times of real need as unemployment, retirement and health crises? Let's address the frugality training to the privileged, whose excessive consumption withdraws money from the public good and deteriorates our environment."

We pay a 5-cent deposit on each beer or soda container. If we do not return them, we lose our nickels, the retailer does not pay a refund and the wholesaler still has our nickels. These nickels are the target of the proposal."

Although the federation's ethics committee has indeed ordered that he be suspended from playing in tournaments, that suspension is not in effect because Mr. Rosenberg is appealing. His case will be heard in August."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"The strange relationships that can emerge when two people assume the roles of driver and passenger come into play in the economy-size ''FARES TO REMEMBER.'' This series, which includes seven creakers, charmers and classics, is part of a larger, somewhat dubious centennial tribute to the first gas-powered taxi in New York City, organized by the Design Trust for Public Spaces. (You can read more about the celebration at taxi07.org.) New Yorkers who have either narrowly escaped death by cab or are currently experiencing slow death by fumes may wonder what there is to celebrate about any machine with a gas-hungry internal combustion engine. Those still mourning the Checker may also find little to celebrate. Still, despite some capricious choices -- including non-New York titles like Neil Jordan's 1986 British drama ''Mona Lisa'' -- the series makes for diverting viewing. In Mitchell Leisen's 1939 screwball comedy ''Midnight,'' a marvelous Claudette Colbert and a game Don Ameche run amok inside a Parisian cab and out; in Jim Jarmusch's 1991 ''Night on Earth,'' Winona Ryder, among others, helps take us for an engaging spin. Also on view is Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece ''Taxi Driver,'' in which the director himself plays a virulently sexist and racist passenger whose rage seems to tap into a primordial element of the taxicab experience: ''Did you ever see what a .44 Magnum pistol can do to a woman's face?'' No, but I have seen what a New York cab can do to her nerves.

But herds of young actors have been saying the same thing since last fall, when Disney's ''High School Musical'' started hurtling into school drama departments: The show is unstoppable. The TV movie that set off a million adolescent singalongs before its soundtrack went on to become the biggest-selling album of last year is currently rah-rah-ing its way across more than 1,300 school stages worldwide, according to Disney officials; more than 100 of them are in elementary, middle and high schools in the suburbs around New York."

At least seven youths were arrested. Mr. Bramson, describing the violent clash as an ''anomaly,'' said the city would accelerate the start of its summer security and youth outreach programs, increase the overall police presence in downtown, and improve communication with Metro-North, so that local police officials would be informed whenever a large group boards a train at another location with New Rochelle as its destination."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Dirty is vastly underrated as a perfume aesthetic. There are, of course, several kinds of dirty. Exhibit A is Agent Provocateur, a lingerie concern that, like Victoria's Secret, professes to sell sex. But while Victoria's Secret is that great Middle American Walt Disney of sex, Agent is slightly grittier, dirtier. Or it professes to be; sex packaged by marketers tends to promise the real thing but is in fact so sterile you couldn't even catch the other person's cold. It's dirt without germs, an idea of intimacy without actually experiencing it. The surprise is that this turns out to be an excellent concept for a perfume. The brilliance of Agent Provocateur, the company's rather astonishing first perfume, is that it doesn't actually smell like unwashed panties. It's better than that: it just reminds you of them. It smells like crushed raspberries and black plums on hot skin. Expertly constructed by the perfumer Christian Provenzano, the juice lasts beautifully, diffuses perfectly and could raise the fertility rate in Manhattan without raising laundry bills. It's like a photo of a thong and cheeky ouverts. All image, no dirt."

City councils can't change the federal government's failed immigration policies, but they can choose whether to offset or intensify the damage.

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Like Fred and Ellen Bishko, who described their Edward Albee-inspired trip in their recent letter to the editor (March 11), my husband and I also went to Easter Island after reading Mr. Albee's rave travelogue, ''The Dream at the End of the World'' (April 30, 2006). Never has a trip so exceeded expectations. The statues were awesome, exactly as Mr. Albee described them, but what he never mentioned was the ravishing beauty and the incredibly mellow vibe of Easter Island."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"Kellie Kvern, 35, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, exploring an old quarter of Beijing in the process of being demolished: ''I went back to Beijing for three weeks; I had lived there for three years as a student and as a teacher of English. I hadn't been back in 10 years, so this trip was just to see the city again. It's pretty common that these homes are going down to make way for new stuff. We met a family that was still living in that neighborhood, and they invited us into their house to have lunch. I can't imagine that they were thrilled about the demolition, but we didn't have any conversations about it. Everything just changes so fast there. I brought a friend of mine from New York who had never been, and she and I were in the same boat. Going back after 10 years was really like going to the city for the first time.'' As told to Austin Considine"
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"The big attraction in New York this week is the public opening on Friday of the new GREEK AND ROMAN GALLERIES at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With 30,000 square feet of space and more than 5,000 objects, it rounds out the story of ancient Western Classical culture in imperious style with a sweep through Hellenism and Augustan Rome to the coming of Christianity. Add the fascinations of Etruscan art, and you have a panoramic adventure to look forward to. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. A day later the opening of ''GEGO, BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVISIBLE'' at the Drawing Center in SoHo takes us from the grand to the antimonumental. This survey of work by the German-born Venezuelan artist Gertrud Goldschmidt (1912-1994), who went by the name of Gego, includes ink drawings on paper and in meshlike weavings of stainless-steel wire. Little known outside Latin America until fairly recently, Gego, with her fragile but tensile linear art, is now recognized as one of the most memorable of the late 20th century. Through July 21, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. Finally there are two memorable exhibitions outside Manhattan. In Brooklyn a lively group show called ''POSTMILLENNIAL BLACK MADONNA,'' with new works by 23 young artists, is split between two enterprising institutions, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in Fort Greene (through May 12, 80 Hanson Place, 718-230-0492, mocada.org) and the Skylight Gallery of the Restoration Plaza in Bedford-Stuyvesant (through May 5, 1368 Fulton Street, third floor, 718-636-6976, restorationplaza.org). I also recommend another ensemble effort, ''A JAMAICA, QUEENS THING,'' in which a bunch of smart young artists look back at the South Queens music scene of two decades ago. It's at the Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning, a classic example of a grass-roots alternative space. Through June 2, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, (718) 658-7400, jcal.org."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was a Clinton appointee to the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, that ''obscure'' State Department panel that was the subject of Jeremy Kahn's article ''Is the U.S. Protecting Foreign Artifacts? Don't Ask'' [April 8]. I fully endorse the arguments that the appointed membership of the panel is heavily skewed toward the archaeologists' perspective and that the committee's activities are inappropriately secretive. The public should be made aware of those who have been empowered to direct America's foreign cultural policy -- and hold them accountable."
2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"LET'S start by addressing the obvious. There was no nepotism involved when Karen Lawrence was named the 10th president of Sarah Lawrence College. Despite what she describes as ''the karma and coincidence'' of sharing a name with the school, the match was professional, not personal. Dr. Lawrence, 58, who will assume her post in August, comes to Sarah Lawrence from the University of California, Irvine, where she began serving as dean of humanities in 1998. Even within that large research institute, Dr. Lawrence said, she tried to create the kind of intimacy and dialogue in which liberal arts colleges specialize."

2007-04-15T00:00:00Z,"How lasers work: In dermatology-speak, the word ''laser'' is a catchall for devises that use intense beams of focused bright light, those that use intense pulsed light (producing short, quick flashes) and ones that employ radio frequency or electromagnetic energy. To diminish wrinkles, some types of lasers, like Titan and Thermage, send energy deep into the dermis (the lower layers of skin) without damaging the epidermis (the upper layer). That energy creates heat and a slight injury, which sends the body into repair mode, encouraging existing collagen (a building block of skin) to contract and become tighter, and stimulating new collagen and elastin (another building block) to be produced. The result? Smoother, plumper, more youthful-looking skin. Other lasers, like Lyra, Affirm and V-Beam, have specific wavelengths that are attracted only to certain pigments, such as red or brown, and destroy anything within that color range, so they work well on blood vessels, spider veins, sunspots and hair. What a laser procedure is like: Most involve an application of topical anesthesia or a cooling gel, followed by a few passes of the device over the area to be treated. Patients usually experience slight warmth or a mild burning sensation, which dissipates quickly. Aftereffects can be similar to a sunburn -- including some redness, swelling or flaking for up to a few days. How to find the right person to perform the procedure: Since you do not need a license to operate a laser, it's best to look for a board-certified dermatologist (check the American Academy of Dermatology Web site at www.aad.org) who has lasers as a major part of his or her practice. Be sure to do your research: in the wrong hands, you could be burned or scarred. Adds Dennis Gross, M.D., a dermatologist and dermatological surgeon in New York (212-725-4555), ''A word-of-mouth recommendation never hurts.'' How to take care of post-laser skin: Use gentle products, don't scrub and slather on a nonirritating sunscreen -- like one with zinc oxide -- on a daily basis. Cost: It depends on the doctor, the size of the area to be treated and the strength of the laser."

2007-04-16T11:58:50Z,"Which ""W"" should concern us the most? Weather or weapons? Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International suggests that question ahead of the first-ever debate on climate change at the UN Security Council on Tuesday. ""Time is of the essence,"" Townsely wrote in a discussion paper he forwarded to me over the weekend. ""The Council must live up to its mandate and address the threat of Weather of Mass Destruction with the same vigor as it is currently pursuing Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" he said in the paper, to be posted on the Greenpeace website on Tuesday. Townsley's point is that climate change will lead to increased geopolitical tension and conflict because of shifts in where food can grow and water can be accessed, and because of mass migrations from rising temperatures and sea levels. The looming challenges could mean a radical change in how nations cooperate and distribute aid money around the world. That's something the Security Council could help to address. But, as Townsley points out, the United Nations plans no resolution and ultimately the job of finding enough money to help curb climate change and adapt to its effects will fall to nation states. Instead of more talk, Townsely wants governments to walk the walk by starting to channel massive chunks of their military budgets -- including money to replace aging nuclear weapons -- into renewable energy projects and efficiency to slash global emissions dramatically by mid-century. Is Townsley right? Do we live in a world where turning swords into ploughshares -- or into biomass for making clean electricity -- is the highest priority? Or is Townsley being naÃ¯ve in a world still beset by terrorism and the threat of nuclear strikes from rogue states?"

The Red Cross was assisting. Residents would probably be able to return home by this afternoon, Mr. Roberts said. The Fire Department asked Public Service Electric and Gas to shut off power in a four-block area around the scene, affecting 1,400 customers, according to a utility spokeswoman. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a very bad day here, between the flooding and this fire,&#8221; Mr. Roberts said. Compiled by John Sullivan."

2007-04-17T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''Pas de Deux of Sexuality is Written in the Genes '' (April 10): Nicholas Wade concludes that sex differences in the brain are responsible for the differing ways that women and men express their sexuality. In assuming that brain structure ''is written in the genes,'' Mr. Wade completely overlooks environmental influences on brain development. There is ample evidence from the field of neuroscience that patterns of neural connections, and therefore brain organization, change constantly with experience. Indeed, contrary to Mr. Wade's claim that distinct patterns in female and male brains exist ''despite the heavy influences of culture,'' culture may in fact be the cause of many of these differences. Mr. Wade's views notwithstanding, the nature/nurture controversy is far from being resolved. Alison Nash New Paltz, N.Y. To the Editor: Professor Anthony F. Bogaert speculates that ''the fraternal birth order effect'' in which ''each additional older brother increases the odds of same-sex attraction by 33 percent'' results from ''maternal immune response.'' Another possibility is fetal microchimerism. Mothers carry male fetal cells for decades. Male DNA has been detected in women 38 years after their last male birth. Fetal cells can even repair maternal brain damage. On evolutionary biology grounds, microchimerism seems more likely than maternal immune response. The article notes that ''male and female neurons behave somewhat differently when kept in laboratory glassware.'' Perhaps male cells have evolved to infiltrate Mom and turn future brothers gay?

2007-04-18T00:00:00Z,"Groups representing Michigan's public museums, theaters, music halls and other cultural institutions plan to rally at the state capital in Lansing today in hopes of lifting a freeze on state spending for the arts. The moratorium was ordered last month by the state's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, as part of efforts to head off a $686 million budget deficit. State law requires that any deficit must be wiped out by the end of the state's fiscal year on Sept. 30. The governor's action affects about $7.5 million of $10 million in state aid that was to be paid to cultural institutions this year. Many institutions say they have already planned their budgets in the expectation of state funding, and the spending freeze is forcing some to cut programs and consider job reductions. In an e-mail message to contributors, the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, which has lost $42,000 in state funding, said it was eliminating its Cinema Slam, a monthly showcase for short films. But some Michigan legislators already are proposing cuts in state arts spending for the next fiscal year, when the state's budget crisis is likely to deepen. MICHELINE MAYNARD"

The economists were mostly old Republican policy hands. The youngest member of the group -- the only one who hadn't worked for Ronald Reagan or Gerald Ford -- was Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia professor in his early 40s. After Mr. Bush won, Mr. Hubbard went on to become the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and an architect of the tax cuts that -- love them or hate them -- have undeniably been the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's domestic policy.

2007-04-18T00:00:00Z,"Ever since his films began to attract admiring attention from the international film festival crowd, the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has encouraged his tongue-tied Western fans to call him Joe. That friendly, disarming gesture reflects the sensibility behind the movies, which are at once stubbornly difficult -- resistant to summary, at times even to understanding -- and surprisingly warm and gentle. Unabashed art films that demand patience and close, quizzical attention, they are also generous, unpretentious and funny, posing thorny formal questions in a relaxed, democratic spirit. It is possible to feel, watching his earlier movies ''Blissfully Yours'' or ''Tropical Malady,'' that you just don't get, on a conscious, cerebral level, what Mr. Weerasethakul is trying to do. Yet at the same time you find yourself moved, even enchanted, by the beautiful, oblique stories unfolding before your eyes. It thus may or may not be helpful to know that the situations in his new film, ''Syndromes and a Century,'' were suggested by events in the lives of the director's parents before they became a couple. This information does not provide any clues about the plot, but it can help ground some of the film's fugitive moods of nostalgia and romantic longing, the feelings that attend a child's contemplation of the endless mystery of his own origins."

And when Mr. Cho finally and horrifyingly came to the world's attention on Monday, he did so after writing a note that bitterly lashed out at his fellow students for what he deemed their moral decay.

But those acquaintances were frequently disturbed by his isolation from the world and his barely concealed anger."

Bahrain was the first race of the season at which Ferrari chose to display the name of its tobacco sponsor. It is not only the tobacco companies and the teams - except Ferrari and its sponsor - who have decided to fall in line with legislation that is quickly expanding worldwide against tobacco sponsorship, it is also much of the print media - although not so much television. So it is that many newspapers and magazines no longer use images of cars with tobacco sponsors. Moreover, it is clear to me that Ferrari's very occasional use of its tobacco sponsor's name and logo this year is actually going to seriously backfire against Ferrari, its tobacco sponsor and Formula One in general. It has already started."

2007-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Thailand unveiled a draft constitution that eliminates direct elections for the Senate while bolstering the power of the unelected judiciary. The document, posted on Parliament's Web site, was drafted by a 35-member committee selected by the junta and will be presented at public forums beginning next week, and then to a national referendum in September. While the 1997 Constitution rescinded by the coup leaders sought to consolidate Thai politics and avoid the fractured coalitions of the 1990s, its proposed replacement seeks to decentralize power by buttressing the power of judges and bureaucrats.

Two years ago, because of the season-long lockout, there were no playoffs at all.

The survey, which gathered information from 10,000 New Yorkers by telephone, was based on 2005 data, the most recent that was available, city officials said. They said the rate of binge drinking -- defined as having five or more drinks on one occasion in the past month -- was unchanged since 2002. Over all, 14 percent of adult city residents reported binge drinking, lower than the national rate of 24 percent of adults, city officials said. The survey showed that men reported binge drinking three times more frequently than women."
2007-04-19T00:00:00Z,"Remembering some of the students killed at Virginia Tech, in these biographical sketches. Rachael E. Hill, 18 A freshman, she graduated in 2006 from the Grove Avenue Christian School in Henrico County, Va. She was studying biology. Clay Fogler, school administrator for Grove Avenue, said she had a penchant for shoes and was competitive on the volleyball court. He said Ms. Hill's senior yearbook quotation from C. S. Lewis summed up what school officials believe she would say at this time: ''God, who foresaw your tribulation, has specially armed you to go through it, not without pain but without stain.'' Jarrett Lane, 22 A senior and recipient of a special scholarship for engineering students, he was in G. V. Loganathan's classroom when he was killed. He came from Narrows, Va., and was valedictorian of his class at Narrows High School in 2003. His former teachers spoke of him as a four-sport athlete, remembered for his humility and work ethic. Partahi Mamora Lumbantoruan, 34 A doctoral student in civil engineering, he was one of 16 Indonesians at Virginia Tech. He arrived three years ago from Parahyangan University in the West Java capital of Bandung. His father, a retired Army officer, said he had sold off property and cars to finance his son's tuition. Rhondy Rahardja, president of the Indonesian Students Organization, said Mr. Lumbantoruan was ''superdisciplined,'' and always wore a polo shirt tucked neatly into his pants. The Indonesian student association offered to clean up his apartment. That's where they learned his secret passion: ''He had 30 films, all about war,'' Mr. Rahardja said, from ''The Thin Red Line'' to ''The Alamo.'' Daniel P. O'Neil, 22 He was pursuing a master's in environmental engineering and also served as a teaching assistant at Virginia Tech. From Lincoln, R.I., he was an avid runner, a prolific musician and a big fan of the Beatles, friends said. Mr. O'Neil earned his bachelor's degree at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., where he studied the effects of urban development on regional watersheds. But his passion was writing music, which he posted to his Web site www.residenthippy.com. Minal Panchal, 26 An architecture student from Mumbai, India, she graduated from high school in Mumbai and the Rizvi College of Architecture. Ms. Panchal's Orkut site -- a MySpace for young Indians -- listed her passions as buildings and nature. Among her favorite books were the ''Harry Potter'' series, ''Little Women'' and ''To Kill a Mockingbird.'' Waleed Shaalan, 32 He came to the United States in 2006 from Zagazig, Egypt, leaving behind his wife and 1-year-old son, to follow in his father's footsteps studying civil engineering. He was a member of the Muslim Student Association. On the day he died he told Fahad Pasha, a roommate, that he planned to bring his family to the United States this summer. Randy Dymond, a civil engineering professor at Virginia Tech, said Mr. Shaalan saved the life of a fellow graduate student. Mr. Dymond said the student recounted to him how he and Mr. Shaalan were both in the first classroom the gunman entered. He shot Dr. Loganathan and several students. Mr. Shaalan was badly wounded and lay beside the student, who was not shot but played dead, as the gunman returned two times. Just as the gunman noticed the student, Mr. Shaalan made a move to distract him, at which point he was shot a second time and died. The student believed that Mr. Shaalan purposely distracted the gunman to save him, Mr. Dymond said. Nicole White, 20 In her junior year, she grew up in Isle of Wight County, Va., loving horses and the water. A friend, Chance Hellmann, who graduated from Smithfield High School with Ms. White in 2004, said she intended to follow a veterinary track at Virginia Tech but she was ultimately drawn to a double major, in international studies and German."

2007-04-19T00:00:00Z,"A member of the Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in New York State, charged yesterday that an aide to Gov. Eliot Spitzer threatened to have her removed if she did not back away from efforts to investigate Consolidated Edison over last year's blackout in Queens. The member, Cheryl Buley, a commissioner appointed last year by Gov. George E. Pataki, made the accusation against Steve A. Mitnick, an assistant secretary to Mr. Spitzer, as the commission voted unanimously yesterday to proceed with the investigation. The investigation, which was opposed by the utility and by New York City officials, allows the commission to determine whether the company can charge customers some of the costs associated with the blackout. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, said no one from the administration told Ms. Buley to vote against the investigation, which she said the governor supports. NICHOLAS CONFESSORE"

2007-04-19T00:00:00Z,"FOR most people, a decorator show house is more a place of fantasy than reality. The furniture and the artwork are often expensive, the rooms larger than life. But there are always professionally executed details that one can learn from and ideas for do-it-yourselfers to try at home. This year the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, a six-floor town house at 14 East 82nd Street, is filled with unusual wall treatments that can be adapted for use in real homes with a little modification. A number of new products on display are available to the public. Of course, the decorators who created these rooms are available for hire, but sometimes it is more fun to try your own hand at designing your living space. 1. In the dining area, L'Olivier, a New York florist, submerged pincushion blossoms in cylinders of water instead of filling vases the usual way, and Eric Cohler walled off the space with Definition resin panels by Armstrong. The two-by-six-foot panels come in 16 colors and textures, and attach to the floor and ceiling with wires. Each panel is $699; (877) 276-7876 or armstrong.com. 2. Using a simple spray mount, Randall Beale and Carl Lana glued aluminum foil to the wainscoting along the staircase between the entrance foyer and the first floor. ''Our inspiration was Andy Warhol's Silver Factory,'' Mr. Beale said. ''After all, isn't a show house about experimentation?'' He added: ''The foil nicks, but it acquires a patina, and it is easy to repair. If I was doing this in a real house I would coat the foil with clear polyurethane.'' 3. Noel Jeffrey cut grass cloth wallcovering into squares and applied them to the walls, creating a checkerboard pattern. Grass cloth comes in many colors and can be bought in rolls like regular wallpaper. Mr. Jeffrey used all one color, but a multicolor pattern would also work. 4. On the second-floor landing, Ed Ku and Etienne Coffinier hammered big nailheads into the wall to create a swirling pattern to give the effect of molding or wallpaper. 5. Jamie Drake used fabrics from his new F. Schumacher collection, which was ''inspired by all the French fashion stuff I love,'' he said. The chairs are covered in a silk-and-cotton blend called Babe's Tweed ($93 a yard) and the shades are made of a sheer called Bubble Lounge ($141 a yard); to the trade, from F. Schumacher, (800) 332-3384 or fschumacher.com for showrooms. 6. Wayne Nathan and Carol Egan's installation is a novel and inexpensive way to cover a wall: cut pieces of packing tape printed with words like fragile, then plaster them on the wall to create texture and pattern. Mr. Nathan and Ms. Egan had their tape printed in silver and white, but red and white from the hardware store would work just as well. 7. Eva Lee, a decorative arts painter and a partner in Christianson Lee Studios, used a decoupage technique on the stairwell between the fourth and fifth floors. Handpainted faux bois paper was applied to the wall, pieces of digitally cut leaf-shaped paper were layered on top, and the wall was varnished, replicating the appearance of inlaid wood. To create a similar effect, attach pieces of paper to the wall with wallpaper paste, then varnish the whole thing. Wrinkles in the paper will add texture."

O.R.C.A., the country's largest animal protection society, said that the noise and vibrations of the concert would be extremely harmful to the animals and added that sedating them is not the answer. The society said that if it failed to persuade the organizers to move the concert from the Hippodrome, Belgrade's largest fenced space, it would appeal directly to the Stones -- including Mick Jagger, above -- who have never performed in Serbia. ''I believe we'll succeed, since such a reputable band will not allow such a stain on its record,'' said Elvir Burazerovic, the president of O.R.C.A.

Gere's Kisses Reach Court India's overburdened judicial system has two new cases after three lawyers filed complaints against Richard Gere, 57, for kissing the actress Shilpa Shetty, below, 31, at an AIDS awareness rally in New Delhi, The Associated Press reported. Public displays of affection are largely taboo in India. In one complaint a lawyer accused the actors of committing ''an obscene act,'' the Press Trust of India reported. Two other lawyers filed another complaint in Ghaziabad, a town on the outskirts of New Delhi, naming Ms. Shetty and private television channels for showing videos of the incident. Ms. Shetty said the hug and kisses were not obscene and that the public was overreacting. Yesterday, her representative, Dale Bhagwagar, declined comment on the court complaints but said, ''The media should concentrate on the cause of AIDS awareness rather than making an issue out of kisses.''"

Out of all the potentially superlative individual performances (A-Rod included), I would much prefer watching a pitcher on top of his game. In every no-hitter, there seems to be a little bit of luck involved, the one close play at a base or a great catch by an outfielder.

2007-04-21T00:00:00Z,"Residents of the mountain town of Monteleone di Spoleto held a noisy protest in front of the Italian Culture Ministry in Rome yesterday, calling for the return of an Etruscan chariot that's a centerpiece of the newly opened Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 2,600-year-old chariot was discovered in Monteleone in 1902 and sold to the Met the next year. Monteleone officials now say it was illegally whisked out of the country. Some 200 people -- about a third of the town's population -- blew whistles and waved placards demanding that the Italian state, which does not support their claim, join their cause. The Met says that because the chariot (detail, right) was bought more than a century ago, the statute of limitations has expired. Nando Durastanti, Monteleone's mayor, who led the delegation, said the Met had ''closed itself off'' to requests to negotiate the artifact's return. ''Mind you, they've been very busy with the opening of the galleries,'' he said by telephone. ''They probably have other things on their minds than our chariot.'' ELISABETTA POVOLEDO"

What I mean is that there are no serious issues that might be appropriately - as opposed to opportunistically - attached to this incident. The story should not be filed under ""free speech"" or ""racist speech"" or ""the culture of indecency"" or ""double standards""; it should be filed under ""blunders with unexpected consequences,"" the subject of an earlier column about men and women who say or do something apparently small and even casual and find, sometimes within minutes, that their public lives are over.In Mr. Imus's case, what followed his disparaging of the Rutgers women basketball players was unanticipated not because he had intended no insult, but because intending insults has always been his line of work, and he had no reason to believe that this five-second instance of his ordinary practice would bring everything crashing down. Many commentators have said that Imus should have distinguished between his usual targets - Hollywood celebrities, politicians, sports icons - and 10 innocent and vulnerable young women. But this criticism assumes that behind what Imus said over the years was some kind of social or moral or philosophical calculation. There was nothing at all behind his daily performances; he was just occupying a professional niche - Don Rickles with a network - and doing exactly what he was paid to do."

Dogs, dogs and more dogs.

But things begin to improve immeasurably for the child with the arrival of Thomas, who can reach the boy in a way that no mere human can.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Lately it seems as if black-and-white photography is being discovered for the first time. More than a few galleries have been showing early work from the 1970s by well-known photographers. Whether the interest in this period is nostalgic, with pictures that appear elegiac, or just the next trend, black and white is clearly having a moment. In contrast to the wall-size, super-saturated color photography dominating the market in recent years, the smaller black-and-white images from the 1970s take on the quality of rare, quaint handmade objects. On view at PACE MacGILL is a show of work by TOD PAPAGEORGE called ''Passing Through Eden -- Photographs of Central Park.'' From the clothing and hairstyles, the people in these pictures are typical of that era, and they sit on benches, lie on the grass, have picnics, or linger. Most are unaware of the camera, un-self-consciously being who they are. Mr. Papageorge, director of Yale's graduate program in photography since 1979, used to go ''shooting'' on the streets of New York a couple of times a week with Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz in the 1960s. That kind of street photography defined what later came to be called the snapshot aesthetic. Here Mr. Papageorge captured authentic moments on his photography walks through Central Park in the 1970s. Composed with keen observation and not a little wit, his black-and-white pictures seem chiseled from the light, every detail precision-cut; the prints glow as if illuminated from within by the silver of the paper itself. Nostalgia or novelty notwithstanding, they are as pure as photography gets. 32 East 57th Street, Midtown."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"THE MARKET The News -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at record highs for three consecutive sessions, topping out at 12,961.98 on Friday following encouraging earnings reports. Behind the News -- The rise of the Dow came just two months after its biggest fall in percentage terms since March 2003, when it closed down 416.02 points, or 3.29 percent on Feb. 27. That drop followed a global wave of selling set off by a plunge in China's stock market. This time, the American market appeared to shrug off news that China may raise interest rates to cool down its economy, which grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter. The broader market struggled on the first two record days, with losing stocks outnumbering advancers, but by Friday, winners far outpaced losers. THE DIAMOND The News -- Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees' third baseman, set an American League record by hitting 12 home runs in the first 15 games of the season. Behind the News -- As baseball's highest-paid player ($252 million over 10 years) he was leading the American and National Leagues not only in home runs as of Friday night, but in runs batted in, with 30, and was batting ..371. He has come through dramatically in the clutch, as well, twice hitting game-winning home runs to center field with two outs in the ninth inning.Though the season is in its infancy, there is already concern in the Yankee organization that Rodriquez might opt out of his contract at the end of the season and become a free agent. How to describe his performance so far? ''Scary,'' said his manager, Joe Torre. THE POUND The News -- The British pound rose above $2, its highest level against the dollar since 1981. Behind the News -- This may not be the summer for Americans to hop across the pond for a visit. But for the British, it's another story. Travel agents in Britain have reported a 30 percent increase in bookings for American vacations in recent weeks as the pound edged upward, according to The Times of London. Europeans may be joining them, as the dollar has also been declining against the euro. The pound's rise came after a surge in British inflation led to expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates, increasing demand for the pound as investors look for bigger returns there. Some analysts expect the pound to remain above $2 for a while. THE INVESTOR The News -- Mutual funds distributed a record $418.5 billion to investors in 2006, surpassing the previous high set in 2000 by nearly $42 billion, according to estimates by Lipper, a fund research company. Behind the News -- It was also a good year for Uncle Sam. Those investors paid at least $23.8 billion in taxes on their capital gains, dividend and interest income, according to Lipper. Still, the tax bite was $7.5 billion less than in 2000, because of reductions in the tax rates. But Lipper warned that ''the tax holiday of sorts is over'' because mutual funds can no longer carry forward losses from the bear market of 2000 to 2002 to offset future gains. Over all, investors in mutual funds experienced what Lipper called ''another banner year'' with stock funds returning an average 14.78 percent. THE HAIRCUT The News -- John Edwards, one of the Democratic presidential candidates, spent $400 for a haircut in Los Angeles, his campaign said. Behind the News -- Actually, it was $800, for two haircuts in recent months, both by the Beverly Hills hairstylist Joseph Torrenueva. He usually charges $175, but upped the fee to $400 because he went to Mr. Edwards rather than seeing him at his salon. The last political haircut to make big headlines was in 1993, when former President Bill Clinton paid $200 for a trim by Christophe, another Beverly Hills stylist, as Air Force One sat at Los Angeles International Airport. Mr. Clinton was skewered then, as Mr. Edwards was last week. ''John Edwards has a new campaign slogan,'' joked Jay Leno. ''Shampoo, rinse, repeat.''"

I am familiar with the debacle because my wife was and is a pension participant.

The common strategy is to get off to a fast start and finish with the fastest runner. 13. a. Contacting the ball with the heel of a cupped or open hand provides for surface coverage of the ball and control over the ball. 14. d. Although most players, even at fairly advanced levels, will have better control with the dominant foot than with the nondominant foot, it is still essential that practice in dribbling at every level emphasize use of both feet. 15. c. All three activities require a compact arrangement of the body so that it can move smoothly through the medium (air or water). The failure to observe this would hinder movement by creating turbulence. 16. d. After skiing, walking expends the most energy, followed by bowling and volleyball. 17. b. 18. c. With age, ever-greater percentages of body cells become less metabolically active, generally causing more body fat to accumulate over time. 19. b.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"The British composer Nicholas Maw, born in 1935, is generally described as a Neo-Romantic. But that does not tell it all. His elegant works are also filled with striking modern touches that make them elusive and fresh. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center presents the premiere of Mr. Maw's String Sextet. Preceding it are pieces by composers Mr. Maw cites as strong influences: Haydn, Schumann, Bruckner, Strauss and Britten. Friday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. Speaking of the Chamber Music Society, the players of the Vermeer Quartet, founded in 1969 at the Marlboro Music Festival, come from Israel, Germany, Nebraska and New York. This eminent string quartet has announced that its current tour will be its last. The final New York concert includes works by Schubert, Britten and Dvorak. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall; $30 to $52. Then there is the program by the Metropolitan Museum Artists in Concert, the museum's house ensemble, which boasts a roster of strong and noted players. This unusual program offers two early Schoenberg works: the audacious String Quartet No. 2 and his surprisingly effective cabaret songs, ''Brettl-Lieder.'' Works by Schubert and Brahms complete the program. Friday at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $30. Enough with chamber music. Those who attend the American Composers Orchestra's concert may some day brag that they heard John Adams conduct three of his own works, major scores all: ''My Father Knew Charles Ives''; the Violin Concerto, with the dynamic Leila Josefowicz as soloist; and ''The Wound-Dresser,'' a profound setting of Walt Whitman's poem about his experience tending to injured Civil War soldiers. The bass-baritone Eric Owens is soloist in this vocally and emotionally challenging work. Friday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $16 to $43."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"TOMORROW is the first day of TV-Turnoff Week, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I want to comply. It's a cause that has my sympathy. On the other hand, television is one of the few places where my 15-year-old son, Asher, and I can hang out together. That might sound blighted, and the penurious nature of our present relations might be all my fault, but it is what it is. Some people have Paris. We have ''Animal Cops: Houston.'' Accepting this hasn't come easily. When Asher was little and controllable, it was possible to stick to my resolve of raising him with a minimum of television in his life. I wasn't allowed to watch more than half an hour a week when I was growing up, and my mother's claims that it was a waste of time, a destroyer of brain cells, a purveyor of unhealthy food and unnecessary material items, which seemed like a paranoid rant at the time, came to make sense to me as an adult."

However, we were also sad that we were away from home and away from our families for these Christmas festivities. The whole weekend we were thinking of our parents. It was Christmastime: The shopping was something for us, something for them, something for us, something for them. In this photo, the people walking past are a blur, so the focus is on us. That's the way we think of our holidays: We take it easy and at our pace, but so many people still live everyday lives and still have to do everyday things. So we can pause and stop time for as long as we like, yet people still move on.'' As told to J. R. Romanko"

In 1585 the British artist John White accompanied a group of colonists to the North Carolina coast with instructions to ''drawe to liefe all strange birdes, beastes, fishes, plantes.'' The resulting images, collected here, are like a slide show of the wonders they found: flying fish, colorful butterflies and a variety of Native American tribes. White probably saw the flamingo when he passed through the Bahamas or the West Indies."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"On June 25, 1980 (a date he would remember), a good-natured Filipino pool-maintenance man gathered his wife and five children for an upsetting ride to the Manila airport. At 36, Emmet Comodas had lived a hard life without growing hardened, which was a mixed blessing given the indignities of his poverty. Orphaned at 8, raised on the Manila streets where he hawked cigarettes, he had hustled a job at a government sports complex and held it for nearly two decades. On the spectrum of Filipino poverty, that alone marked him as a man of modest fortune. But a monthly salary of $50 did not keep his family fed."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Tough to Hit Mark Buehrle of the White Sox, who no-hit Texas in his last start, is scheduled to start tomorrow against Kansas City. Johnny Vander Meer, with the Reds in 1938, is the only pitcher to throw no-hitters in consecutive starts. Vander Meer no-hit the Boston Bees, 3-0, on June 11, then no-hit the Dodgers, 6-0, on June 15. Vander Meer pitched 21 consecutive hitless innings that season. A Baseball Hat Trick Last Monday, first baseman Aubrey Huff of the Orioles could not handle a spinning grounder hit by B. J. Upton of the Devil Rays, then overthrew first base on the same play. Baltimore catcher Paul Bako, who was backing up first, grabbed the wild throw and threw wildly as Upton advanced to third. The last time a team made three errors on a single play was on May 23, 1998, when the Astros did it against the Padres. It Could Be Worse Players off to slow starts at the plate should take solace. Richie Scheinblum, with the 1969 Indians, went 0 for 30 in April. Watch List Toronto's Aaron Hill is having a good year in average (.306) and runs batted in (11). While Hill improved his average by 17 points with nearly 200 more at-bats in his second season last year, he does not figure to compete for a batting title any time soon. He will not face the Royals' pitching staff again for a while, either. After going 7 for 11 in three games against Kansas City, he was 5 for his last 27 and on his way back to earth. The Cubs' Rich Hill is 3-0 with a 0.41 earned run average. The left-handed Hill, 27, has used a dominant curveball to strike out 18 in 22 innings. In his first 14 big-league appearances in 2005 and 2006, he had a 9.20 E.R.A. But his current results correspond with his minor league numbers, when he averaged more than 12 strikeouts per nine innings. Long labeled a top prospect, Wilson Betemit survived the Dodgers' experiment with Julio Lugo last year and is their starting third baseman. How has he responded? By getting 5 hits in his first 38 at-bats. If Betemit cannot find his stroke, the Dodgers could give up on their plans of switching the top prospect of the moment, Andy LaRoche, to the outfield.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"TOMORROW is the first day of TV-Turnoff Week, and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I want to comply. It's a cause that has my sympathy. On the other hand, television is one of the few places where my 15-year-old son, Asher, and I can hang out together. That might sound blighted, and the penurious nature of our present relations might be all my fault, but it is what it is. Some people have Paris. We have ''Animal Cops: Houston.'' Accepting this hasn't come easily. When Asher was little and controllable, it was possible to stick to my resolve of raising him with a minimum of television in his life. I wasn't allowed to watch more than half an hour a week when I was growing up, and my mother's claims that it was a waste of time, a destroyer of brain cells, a purveyor of unhealthy food and unnecessary material items, which seemed like a paranoid rant at the time, came to make sense to me as an adult."

Getting students involved in music theater yields many secondary benefits such as building self-esteem, being part of a group enterprise and even some improvement of study skills and grades. But it should also be meeting some primary artistic and educational goals as well."
2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"In our ever-recyclable culture things don't get old; they become ''vintage.'' This week is a particularly interesting one for vintage theater. ''Biography,'' a comedy by a largely forgotten American playwright, S. N. Behrman, is resurrected by the Pearl Theater. And a whole company, the legendary Living Theater, springs back onto the scene with a new home and a new version of one of its most controversial works. The big event is the return of the LIVING THEATER, the celebrated avant-garde company founded by Judith Malina and Julian Beck. This unabashedly radical troupe hit its stride in the early 1960s, winning its third Obie award in 1963 for ''The Brig,'' the autobiographical play by Kenneth H. Brown about the brutality of a Marine Corps prison. Itinerant for many years, the company now has a permanent space to play in, and Ms. Malina, still very much in charge (Mr. Beck died in 1985), will direct the new production. ''The Brig'' opens Thursday at the Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, livingtheatre.org; $20 to $30. The experimental theatrics of the Living Theater seem remote from today's scene, but the high comedy exemplified by the work of Mr. Behrman is probably a further stretch. ''BIOGRAPHY,'' produced on Broadway in 1932, is the story of a painter setting out to write her memoirs. Trouble arises when a key player in her past, now a prominent political figure, registers an objection. The third major character is the radical publisher, intent on getting his author to tell all. J. R. Sullivan directs. ''Biography'' opens Sunday at the Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802, pearltheatre.org; $40 to $70."
2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"THE federal government helped create the mortgage industry in 1934 by insuring long-term housing loans, but it has largely disappeared from the market in recent years as private lenders have led the mortgage boom. Now government loans may once again be finding a spot on the borrower's short list. Mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration are starting to make a comeback as banks and regulators tighten lending standards throughout the nation and turn away many low- and moderate-income homeowners. According to mortgage industry analysts and executives, such loans include important benefits not common in the current pool of conventional mortgages."

On the other hand, television is one of the few places where my 15-year-old son, Asher, and I can hang out together. That might sound blighted, and the penurious nature of our present relations might be all my fault, but it is what it is. Some people have Paris. We have ''Animal Cops: Houston.'' Accepting this hasn't come easily. When Asher was little and controllable, it was possible to stick to my resolve of raising him with a minimum of television in his life. I wasn't allowed to watch more than half an hour a week when I was growing up, and my mother's claims that it was a waste of time, a destroyer of brain cells, a purveyor of unhealthy food and unnecessary material items, which seemed like a paranoid rant at the time, came to make sense to me as an adult."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Q. We live in a co-op in a 100-year-old brownstone with several apartments on four floors. The fireplace in the apartment on the first floor appears to have a leak in the chimney so that fumes escape into the adjacent apartment and the common area. The owner has agreed to stop using the fireplace until it is fixed. Who should pay for this repair? A. ''The first step in solving this problem is to determine what is wrong and how it can be fixed,'' said Howard Schechter, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. He said that under most proprietary leases, anything visible in the apartment (other than standard heating equipment like radiators) is the shareholder's responsibility and anything behind the walls, floor or ceiling (with the exception of electrical wiring and certain plumbing connections) is the co-op corporation's."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"HARTMAN--John Wheeler. Management, Innovator, Author, Philanthropist. John Wheeler Hartman of Ocean Reef, Key Largo, Florida, died on April 5th, 2007 at the age of 84. He was predeceased by his wife of 56 years, Esther Kelly Bill Hartman. In 1946. Mr. Hartman was one of the founders of Bacon, Hartman and Vollbrecht, a St. Augustine and Jacksonville, Florida advertising agency. After joining the sales department of Bill Communications, Inc., a New York city-based magazine publisher, he became its Chief Executive Officer in 1957, and later Chairman of the Board. In 1975, Mr. Hartman introduced the publishing industry's first decentralized participatory management plan and Employee Stock Ownership Trust. Bill employees at all levels were encouraged to make management contributions and decisions. Several of Mr. Hartman's unconventional innovations, such as his ''Bottoms Up Management'' theory, remain to this day as case studies at Harvard's Business School. Mr. Hartman's witty writings appeared in a column he titled Second Thoughts, which was originally published in Sales & Marketing Management magazine. He has authored nine books including More Second Thoughts and Maverick Management. He later became a contributing columnist to other publications, such as Advertising Age, Business Marketing, and the Ocean Reef Free Press. Mr. Hartman, and his wife Kelly's philanthropy established the Hartman Center for MidSized Company Education and Research at the Fuqua Graduate School of Business and the Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and Marketing History at the college library. The Hartman's also donated 300 acres to the Town of Lyme, CT., to create the Hartman Park. Mr. Hartman was born in Detroit, Michigan, and attended Colgate University before receiving his Bachelor's degree from Duke University. He served as a Lieutenant JG in the U.S. Navy during World War II and participated in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6th, 1944. He wrote for the U.S. Navy's newspaper, The Inlander from 194546, and was a correspondent in Florida for United Press International. In 1963, he was elected international president of the Young Presidents Organization, serving as board member and Forum Chairman of the Chief Executives Organization. He founded the Executive Council of the Conference Board and was a member of the World Presidents' Organization. Mr. Hartman is survived by daughter, Kelly H. Sherwood, of Woolwich, Maine; son Raymond Hartman, of Mooresville, NC; grandchildren, Katerina Sterghiou, of Brooklyn, NY, and Nicola Hartman, of San Carlos, CA; a brother, Robert E. Hartman, of Albuquerque, NM; and a sister, Ann Carter, of Darien, CT. $(6$)HARTMANN--Charolotte Sigrid, age 86, February 26, 1921-April 16, 2007. Visiting hours on Tuesday April 24, 2007, 4-8pm.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"MATTERS were simpler 100 years ago, when junior colleges were created to prepare deserving students for the final two years of a university. In fact, the very first public junior college, in Joliet, Ill., was set up in a high school, as the equivalent of grades 13 and 14. Community colleges today do far more than offer a ladder to the final years. They train the people who repair your furnace, install your plumbing, take your pulse. They prepare retiring baby boomers for second or third careers, and provide opportunities for a growing number of college-age students turning away from the high cost and competition at universities. And charged with doing the heavy remedial lifting, community colleges are now as much 10th and 11th grade as 13th and 14th."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"To a first-timer, the letters that arrive in spring from financial aid offices can be a head-scratcher: no two packages are alike. Private institutions, especially, interpret family finances in different ways; some have deeper pockets; some fail to meet ''demonstrated need'' (the difference between the cost of attending and the amount a family is deemed able to pay, according to a need analysis formula). According to an annual College Board survey, the private colleges below provide aid packages that meet the highest percentage of need. In reviewing offers, remember: loans have to be paid back, grants do not. KEY: COST: Tuition, fees, room and board AVERAGE AID PACKAGE: Given freshmen with need SELF-HELP: Work-study and need-based loans NON-NEED: Grants and scholarships, excluding athletic awards PERCENTAGES: % of applicants getting this aid (non-need: % of class) ALL DOLLAR FIGURES IN THOUSANDS (for freshman class, 2005)"

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Okay, Governor Spitzer and New York lawmakers. You finished the budget, only a few hours late, but it's done. You took your spring vacation. Now it is time to tackle one of the truly terrible, disgraceful things about New York's political scene -- the ossified, uncompetitive, self-serving system that virtually guarantees legislators jobs for life. There is more job security in Albany than there once was in Albania, less turnover than in the last outposts of tenured academia, a better chance of a lifelong job than in the strongest of union strongholds. All those years in office do not guarantee more wisdom. They mostly mean more paralysis, more petrifaction. With no fresh ideas, no fresh air, the place gets downright moldy."

He returned to the full time faculty at Montefiore in 1966 and achieved the rank of full professor in Plastic Surgery in 1982 and in Neurosurgery in 1989 at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He was an extremely innovative surgeon, artistic and skilled. His main interests were in the area of Cleft Lip and Palate surgery and congenital ear reconstruction. His surgical talents created major improvements in the quality of life for these children. He was recognized by his peers with membership in many scientific organizations among which were the Association of Plastic Surgeons and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.

A resident of San Francisco since 1986, Dan's roots remained in Washington, D.C. and New York City, where he was born 92 years ago. He was the only one of four children of immigrant parents from Luboml, Ukraine born in the United States. Dan survived his wife Mary by six years and is survived by three children and five grandchildren. With a lifelong commitment to education and learning, Dan graduated from the College of the City of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry in 1934. A course in logic at CCNY significantly influenced Dans thinking and work throughout his professional life. Grateful to CCNY for providing an outstanding, free education, Dan supported the College throughout his life. With the support of the U.S. Army, Dan obtained an M.B.A. from Ohio State University in 1955. He also attended the US Army Command and General Staff College in 1959 and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in 1963. Dan was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1941 and commissioned a second lieutenant in the Adjutant General Corps in 1942. During World War II, he served in Manila and Korea, and de-mobilized in 1946. He re-joined the Regular Army in 1947. In a 25-year military career, primarily in computer technology, he was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Korea Defense Service Medal and the Commendation Medal. In his last tour, Dan was Special Assistant to the Army Chief of Staff for Army Information and Data Systems before retiring as a Colonel in 1967. Dan's background in logic and information systems led him in 1969 to a second career with Con Edison of New York, where he eventually became Executive Vice President. He was part of a new management team brought in to assist the company refocus on customer service and system reliability. He led a team in the successful development and deployment of one of the country's first computer data base customer information retrieval systems, which would allow a service representative to see a customer's records on a computer screen while talking to the customer. Commonplace now, such systems were at the outer edge of information technology at the time. Dan's focus on customer service operations and the reliability of power distribution systems led to a substantial reduction in complaints and to system wide improvements that helped all employees deliver better service to the ratepayers. He remained committed his entire life to a company that he knew affected the lives of millions of residents every day and that was critical to the economic sustainability of the city he loved. Dan retired from Con Edison in 1980 and became President of the Economic Development Council of New York City, Inc. where he coordinated efforts of business, labor and government to improve the economic development environment of New York City. He then went on to consulting career for utilities nationwide, before finally retiring in 1990. A life long student of space, astronomy and the physical world, Dan was a voracious reader. At age 90 he read On The Origin of Species, taking notes as he went. He was a supporter of smaller or less is better long before environmental impacts would be widely understood. For Dan, education never ended and he supported his children and grandchildren generously in their own schooling. He also completed the New York Times crossword puzzle every day for the last 30 years. His family deeply mourns his passing, and will keep his adage that it is always better to share close to our hearts.

It is with deepest sorrow that the Board of Directors, Staff and Members of the Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) mourn the passing of Zachary Hollis, who died tragically and suddenly in an automobile accident in Albuquerque, NM. A kind, cheerful and gentle young man, in his all too brief 16 years, undeniably he touched the lives of everyone who knew him with his positive outlook, exceptional warmth, contagious smile and quick wit. His indomitable spirit and irrepressible sense of humor will be missed by family, friends and all who knew him. He had a passion for research and geology and loved school. He was very active in Boy Scouts and was close to making Eagle Scout, a rank he is being awarded posthumously. Zak also collected old Volkswagen models, enjoyed playing tennis and swimming, and was an avid animal lover, faithfully nurturing his dozens of pets. He wanted to become a neurologist and study the brain. Diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome at the age of eight, he always sought opportunities to raise awareness about this neurological disorder. Zak volunteered his time to the TSA selflessly. He served as an editor of the TSA Children's Newsletter and each year, eagerly looked forward to traveling to Washington D.C. to meet personally with his elected officials to educate them and put a real face on what it meant to have Tourette Syndrome. Zak will be receiving the TSA National Youth Recognition Award posthumously, and the award will be renamed The Zak Hollis National Youth Recognition Award in his honor. Our deepest sympathies and prayers go to his parents, Sandra and Michael, and his siblings, Joshua, Christopher, Jennifer and Rosanna. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Tourette Syndrome Association, Inc., 42-40 Bell Boulevard, Bayside, NY 11361. He will be missed dearly and always remembered with a smile by the many, many people whose lives he touched."

Though I had lived in New York for several years, I had never been to the Hamptons in the summer. Mostly, I was convinced it was not worth the money or the headache to get out there in July.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Many consider CARLOS SAURA, the left-wing Spanish director who challenged the restrictions of the Franco regime, to be the father of modern Spanish cinema. A leader of the movement labeled the New Spanish Cinema in the 1960s, Mr. Saura established his international reputation with sociopolitical allegories like ''Peppermint Frappé'' (1967), ''Garden of Delights'' (1970) and ''Cría Cuervos'' (1976). An international hit, ''Cría'' told the story of a precocious 9-year-old girl using the notion of arrested childhood (a recurrent theme in his work) as a metaphor for growing up under fascism. The movie, filmed while Franco was dying, was released only after his death. These are among the two dozen films directed by Mr. Saura in ''COMMITMENT AND GRACE,'' a comprehensive anthology presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. After Spain's transition to democracy, Mr. Saura largely retreated from politics to explore Spanish culture, spectacularly in three dance films: ''Blood Wedding,'' a flamenco interpretation of García Lorca's masterpiece; ''Carmen'' (1983), which was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign film; and ''Flamenco'' (1995), an elegant, fiery documentary study of flamenco styles photographed by Vittorio Storaro. ''Goya in Bordeaux'' (1999), which follows the 82-year-old painter through the streets of that French city as he reflects on his life and work, is a magnificent fusion of biography and art. Another high point is the satire ''¡Ay, Carmela!'' (1990), in which Mr. Saura returned to the Spanish Civil War as a subject. Starring Carmen Maura, it tells the story of a troupe of performers with Republican sympathies arrested by Nationalists in 1938 who, to save themselves, must suddenly adjust their act.

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Next weekend will lack the sizzle of the 2006 draft, which featured two Heisman Trophy winners (Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart) and leading players from two national championship teams (Bush, Leinart and Vince Young). But teams that need a wideout are in luck. This is a deep group of receivers and contains the best player in the draft, Georgia Tech's Calvin Johnson. He is so good that the Raiders will consider taking him with the first overall pick. But they, like a lot of teams near the top of the draft, need a quarterback. That could be a problem because there are not many top quarterbacks in the draft beyond Louisiana State's JaMarcus Russell and Notre Dame's Brady Quinn. Quinn's stock has fluctuated in the past year and his fate, like Leinart's last year, will be one of the intriguing stories Saturday. The top priority for every team, though, is clear: to avoid players with significant character issues. The new personal conduct policy allows the commissioner to discipline teams that consistently have players in trouble. Below, a look at each team's needs. By JUDY BATTISTA 1. OAKLAND -- Needs plenty on offense, but quarterback remains a top priority on a team that has Randy Moss and Jerry Porter. The Raiders have never traded down in the first round. 2. DETROIT -- Could consider a quarterback, but really needs help on defense, especially defensive end and cornerback. Will listen to plenty of trade offers to move down. 3. CLEVELAND -- Lots of offensive needs, including quarterback and running back. 4. TAMPA BAY -- Desperate for Calvin Johnson, it could try to move up if he is available. 5. ARIZONA -- An offensive tackle who could start immediately. 6. WASHINGTON -- A pass-rushing defensive end; the team had just 19 sacks in 2006. 7. MINNESOTA -- Could use a quarterback, with Tarvaris Jackson penciled in at starter, but also needs playmakers on offense to help whoever the quarterback is. 8. ATLANTA (from Houston) -- Offensive line, safety, receiver, defensive end. 9. MIAMI -- The need for a quarterback is overwhelming, with Daunte Culpepper's health still in question. Also needs lots of bodies on offensive line. 10. HOUSTON (from Atlanta) -- Needs a second receiver to pair with Andre Johnson and give new quarterback Matt Schaub more weapons. It could also use a starting-caliber cornerback. 11. SAN FRANCISCO -- Improved defense with free agency spending spree, but still needs help just about everywhere, especially on the defensive line and the back end of the secondary. 12. BUFFALO -- Willis McGahee is gone, so the Bills need a running back. Also needs linebackers. 13. ST. LOUIS -- Improving the run defense is critical. 14. CAROLINA -- Safety and tight end are its most urgent needs, but linebacker could use an infusion of help, too. 15. PITTSBURGH -- Linebacker and cornerback for a defense that will still be a 3-4, but will likely become a 4-3 under the new coach, Mike Tomlin. 16. GREEN BAY -- A running back and a wide receiver would give Brett Favre more weapons in the West Coast offense. 17. JACKSONVILLE -- Safety is only hole in an otherwise stellar defense. A top-flight receiver would help Byron Leftwich. 18. CINCINNATI -- Needs a big defensive tackle to shore up run defense. Also could use linebacker help. Biggest need: spotless character players. 19. TENNESSEE -- Suspension of Pacman Jones makes cornerback a need, but first priority should be receiver. 20. GIANTS -- Linebacker, cornerback and left offensive tackle. 21. DENVER -- Receiver, pass-rushing end and depth at safety for a team that barely missed the playoffs. 22. DALLAS -- Needs help across the board on defense, particularly at cornerback. 23. KANSAS CITY -- Aging team needs youth everywhere, but especially at wide receiver, offensive line and cornerback. 24. NEW ENGLAND (from Seattle) -- First of two first-round picks for team that was extremely active in free agency; will try to get younger at linebacker and get help in secondary. 25. JETS -- Cornerback is an overwhelming need. 26. PHILADELPHIA -- Linebacker and depth in secondary. 27. NEW ORLEANS -- Cornerback and depth at linebacker and on the defensive line. 28. NEW ENGLAND -- See No. 24. 29. BALTIMORE -- Needs cornerback to replace the aging Samari Rolle, in addition to a linebacker and offensive tackle. 30. SAN DIEGO -- Most talented team in N.F.L. doesn't need much beyond a No. 1 receiver. 31. CHICAGO -- Uncertainty over the futures of linebacker Lance Briggs (seeking trade) and defensive tackle Tank Johnson (could face suspension) make their positions a need. But the team's weakness is offense. 32. INDIANAPOLIS -- Defense was picked over in free agency; needs tackle, linebacker and cornerback."

2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"Some people refer to Long Island Sound as the Urban Sea, which by itself is enough to make you nervous. Since colonial days, humans in great numbers have gravitated to its coastal habitats, bringing housing, commerce, recreation and, inevitably, pollution. An estimated 20 million people live within a 50 mile drive of its shores, and 400 years after the first European explorers came to trade with the Indians, people are still moving to the coast, eating up open space, trampling wildlife habitats and paving over land in ways that reduce nature's capacity to filter and clean contaminated runoff. The remarkable thing is that the Sound is doing as well as it is; though hemmed in by the densest population area in America, this 110-mile-long body of water has, against all odds, remained one of America's great estuaries, still very much at risk but by no means gasping for life the way Chesapeake Bay is. Water quality has improved, osprey and striped bass, among other species, have made dramatic recoveries, rivers have been opened to provide fish passage and there have even been tiny improvements in restoring wetlands. Credit belongs to governments at all levels, advocacy groups and private citizens; indeed, the entire enterprise is as good an example of regional cooperation as one is likely to find."
2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"AS the renters of Hamptons summer shares are making their final plans for the coming season, the five members of our house will be getting ready to say goodbye. We didn't sip piña coladas on the deck; we nursed glasses of port and fed the fireplace. Instead of packing bathing suits, we brought thick sweaters and woolly caps. Renting a cottage off-season, from September through May, was my friend's idea; I said yes without giving it much thought. Though I had lived in New York for several years, I had never been to the Hamptons in the summer. Mostly, I was convinced it was not worth the money or the headache to get out there in July. This, my friend informed me, would be the perfect solution: I would satisfy my California-native craving for sand and sea and avoid the madness."
2007-04-22T00:00:00Z,"RADWELL--Jeanne, 86, died at home peacefully on April 16, 2007, surrounded by loved ones.

Her loss will be felt by her daughters Laura and Amy and son-in-law Chick, her grandsons Zachary, Luke and Dylan, Jason and his wife Christine, her great-granddaughter Zarah-Louise, sister Shoy and brother-in-law Norman and sister-in-law and brother-in-law Shirley and Sam. Blessed by a 50 year marriage to the late Louis Radwell, she lived her life with grace, compassion, and a genuine interest in those around her. She elegantly endured life's travails with a strong spirit and sense of joy. We mourn an accomplished, inspirational woman of unfailing warmth and wit.

Had we not read the article, we would have continued in our assumption that the rescue folks were well intentioned but way over the top in their desire to get the adoption process to stick."

Their 2006 debut album, ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,'' rode an Internet buzz fueled by the band's giving away its songs before release, but the momentum came from the songs themselves. Arctic Monkeys arrived amid a wave of English bands that were rediscovering the terse melodies and hurtling, hard-nosed narratives of new-wave rock. They weren't the first, but they were among the most musically gifted, with two guitarists (Alex Turner and Jamie Cook) who spar and mesh with constant tension and a rhythm section (Andy Nicholson on bass and Matt Helders on drums) that swings as it drives the music."

2007-04-23T00:00:00Z,"ULTAN--Dr. Leslie Barry was born on November 12, 1934 in New York City as the second child and son to late parents Carl and Blanche. Dr. Ultan grew up in Bayside, New York with his parents and older brother, Lloyd, where he attended Bayside High School. After graduating with the Class of 1951, he attended Yale University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Economics and Political Science. While at Yale and on a visit home, Dr. Ultan met Susan Drezner at a sweet sixteen party for a mutual friend, and she became his beloved life partner. Following his college graduation in 1955, Dr. Ultan attended N.Y.U. School of Medicine, and he and Susan were married. After earning his medical degree in 1959, he did his internship at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York and then a residency in internal medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut. Between these trainings he served his country and the U.S. Public Health Service as Heart Disease Control Officer in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He continued to pursue his life's vocation as a heart doctor with a fellowship in cardiology at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. Dr. Ultan established his private practice in Trenton and at Helene Fuld Medical Center, where he became Chief of Cardiology, Chairman of the Coronary Care Unit and Coronary Care Committee, Director of the Non-Invasive Cardiovascular Laboratory and Trustee. A Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and Diplomate to the American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Cardiovascular Diseases, Dr. Ultan taught at Hahnemann and Rutgers Medical School, published medical journal articles and especially enjoyed mentoring and training paramedics and nurses in pre-hospital care of cardiac patients. Throughout his career, he was an active member of the Mercer County Heart Association, serving as President and Trustee. Frustrated with the number of heart attack patients who were dying while being transported by ambulance to the hospital, Dr. Ultan worked with others to establish in Mercer County one of the nation's first community-sponsored all-volunteer mobile intensive care unit programs. The result of their efforts was the Mercer County Lifemobile Program, which he served as founding Project Director. It has since evolved into the Capital Health System Mobile Intensive Care Unit (M.I.C.U.) and continues to bring the highest level of cardiac care equipment and paramedics and nurses trained to use it directly to patients wherever they need it. This program has saved numerous lives since its inception in 1977. Dr. Ultan was awarded a Mercer County Special Recognition Plaque in 1977 for his work helping found the Lifemobile M.I.C.U. Program and made Chairman of the New Jersey Department of Health's Advisory Committee for Mobile Intensive Care Units. He was also the recipient of Helene Fuld Medical Center's first ever Doctor of the Year Award in 1979 and their Superior Clinical Teaching Award in 1981. In 1984, he was presented with the American Heart Association's Golden Heart Award for his career work in cardiac care. Beloved by his patients and colleagues for his dedication, intelligence, wit, charm and wonderful sense of humor, Dr. Ultan had the ability to make any patient feel better just by his presence. He loved to discuss politics, sports, international relations and current events and was a lifelong New York Yankees fan (converting Susan, who wore Brooklyn Dodger blue when he met her.) He will be sorely missed by his family who survive him: wife of 511/2 years Susan, daughter Robyn, sons Robert and William, daughters-in-law Jill and Lisa and grandchildren Matthew, Emily and Sophia. Condolences can be shared with family members, who will be sitting Shiva in his memory at the family home on the evenings of Monday, April 23, 2007, and Wednesday, April 25, 2007. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be given, in the name of Dr. Leslie Barry Ultan, to Capital Health System Foundation's M.I.C.U. Fund, 408 Bellevue Ave., Trenton, NJ 08618, so that such gifts will continue Dr. Ultan's lifelong pursuit of saving and improving lives. Patients, colleagues, community members and all who want to pay their respects are invited to attend a memorial service to celebrate his life, to be held at 11:00 am Thursday, April 26, 2007 at Adath Israel Congregation, 1958 Lawrenceville Road, Lawrenceville, NJ."

Chief Collins said the supervisor was accused of having addressed a group of officers jokingly as ''hos.'' The supervisor was identified by Bonita Zelman, a lawyer for the accusers, as Sgt.

In the second case, a Queens narcotics detective, Aretha Williams, said yesterday at a news conference that a sergeant recently told her, ''Don't give me no lip, or I'll have to call you a nappy-headed ho.''

2007-04-24T00:00:00Z,"Gov. Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, is expected to sign a measure that would make Washington the second state, after California, to grant paid leave to workers after the birth of a child. The bill, passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature on Sunday, would provide up to $250 a week to new parents starting in October 2009. Parents of adopted children could also receive benefits. The bill was amended to remove a section that would have extended the benefits to people caring for a seriously ill relative. The program is expected to cost $19.7 million in 2010 and $21.4 million in 2011, legislative staff members said. The bill did not designate a financing source but instead created a task force to make recommendations by January 2008. California's paid family leave program, which started in 2004, provides up to $882 per week for a total of six weeks and offers benefits for those caring for an ill relative. WILLIAM YARDLEY"

It is difficult for me to express the feelings of sorrow I felt when Bernard and later Robert Friedman called me to tell me that their father Irving had passed away. It will be hard to comprehend that he is no longer with us. I first met Irving Friedman thirty years ago when as vice president of Morse Diesel, I was in charge of building the addition to the Park Avenue Synagogue of which Irving, a successful owner/builder was Chairman of the Building Committee. As such he oversaw construction issues and was my liaison with the Synagogue. What became obvious through the construction process, was not only his dedication in insuring a successful project but the depth of his knowledge and wise counsel on matters relating to the process. Irving was ''hands on'' practical and showed tremendous foresight in solving problems before they occurred. He was instrumental in the success of the project. Through the years in working with Irving on numerous development projects, his energy and tenacity never waned. He was at work every day until very recently and his door was always open to discuss project details both from a technical and financial prospective. He knew where every dollar went and never sacrificed quality for expediency. His name and reputation for building a project that would last the test of time was very important to him. Many times when faced with difficult construction decisions, I would ask myself, ''What would Irving do?'' What Irving would do was usually the right decision. Our industry and I personally share a tremendous loss with the passing of this industry leader and mentor. On behalf of myself and my family I wish to express my sincerest and deepest condolences to his sons, Bernard and Robert Friedman and their families and extended families.

Mr. Trump chose Ms. Schaeffer despite his concerns that she advanced largely ''under the radar'' during the 14 weeks of competition. According to Nielsen's estimates, the live finale attracted 7.9 million viewers, leading the 10 p.m. hour among adults 18 to 49 and delivering the show's largest audience in nearly three months. Average ratings for ''The Apprentice'' have fallen precipitously every season since its debut in January 2004. Compared with the 21 million viewers averaged that first season, this year's edition, the only one set in Los Angeles, drew just 7 million on average. NBC has yet to announce whether the reality show will be renewed. For the night, the network finished third in total viewers and fourth in the 18-to-49 demographic, just behind CBS.

One of four children of Samuel and Bella Gardner, he was born on March 17, 1914 in New York's Lower East Side. His family soon moved to Brooklyn where he attended Erasmus High School. He began his undergraduate studies at Brooklyn College and then matriculated at Arkansas University, where he completed his B.S. and M.D. degrees. He joined the US Public Health Service and, at the start of WWII, was assigned to the US Coast Guard, serving on the USS Charlotte, a destroyer escort in the North Atlantic, as ship's doctor with the rank of Lieutenant. After the war, he completed his residency in obsterics and gynecology in Boston, MA and moved back to NYC. In 1948 he married Madeleine Murphy, whom he met in Buffalo, NY when both were in uniform during the war. (She was a Major in the WACS). After living in NYC, they moved to Levittown, NY where he established one of the first OB/GYN practices in this booming post-war community. Eventually, he established a second office in Merrick, with professional associations at Hempstead General Hospital and Memorial Hospital, and he was named Chief of Obsterics and Gynecology at South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, NY. The Gardner's also lived in Merricak, where they raised their five children: Leslie Gardner Pantucci, Deborah GardnerGray, Cecilia L. Gardner, Samuel Gardner and Mara Gardner. A devoted husband, father and grandfather, adored brother and uncle, he was a dedicated community member and medical professional whose great passion was modern art. As an arts enthusiast, he had a passionate interest in the burgeoning post-war NYC and Long Island art scene and a keen eye as a collector. He was generous with his knowledge and his collection, leading the establishment of the Friends of the Emily Lowe Gallery at Hofstra University and donating many works of art to Hofstra University (where he was also a trustee), Smith College and the Brooklyn, Parrish and Heckscher Museums. A longtime resident of Water Mill, NY, he was truly and ardent ''gardener,'' who delighted in cultivating his beautiful Japanese garden at the waterfront home on Mecox Bay that he built with Madeleine. Madeleine Gardner died in 1983. He later married Mayda Lannick, who survives him along with his five children, daughter-and-sons-in-law and nine grandchildren, all of whom loved him dearly and are thankful for his long, full and very happy life. The funeral service will take place Tuesday, April 24th at 10am at the Riverside Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza in Great Neck, NY. Contributions may be made to the Milton M. Gardner Endowed Scholarship Fund at Hofstra University."

Knopf in June. ''A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' which will weigh in at 640 pages, covers her life up through her decision to run for president, according to a press release issued yesterday. Paul Bogaards, a Knopf spokesman, said that Mr. Bernstein ''reaches conclusions that stand in opposition to what Hillary Clinton has said and written about herself.'' Mr. Bernstein's book is one of at least two biographies about Mrs. Clinton scheduled to come out this summer. ''Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., reporters for The New York Times, is to be published by Little, Brown & Company on Aug. 28, according to Michael Pietsch, Little, Brown's publisher. Mr. Pietsch said the company was ''presently reviewing our publication schedule.'' Mr. Bernstein has been working on his book, which was done without Mrs. Clinton's official cooperation, for eight years. Knopf decided to advance publication, tentatively planned for this fall, as soon as it received the final chapter last Thursday, Mr. Bogaards said. The book has been simultaneously translated so that it can be published in Germany and the Netherlands at the same time as in the United States. Knopf is planning an initial print run of 350,000 copies in the United States. MOTOKO RICH"

2007-04-25T00:00:00Z,"Kryptonite, the one mineral that is deadly to Superman, the Man of Steel, was discovered, really, by a group of researchers in Serbia, according to a report by the BBC. In comic books, kryptonite comes in an assortment of colors and with different side effects. Overexposure to the green variety would kill Superman, whereas the gold kind would permanently strip him of his powers. The real-world researchers turned to Chris Stanley, a mineralogist at the Natural History Museum in London, for help in identifying a substance they found. Dr. Stanley's Web search found that the new mineral's chemistry matched the description of kryptonite's composition in last year's film ''Superman Returns.'' ''The universe is full of mysteries, and some have been foreshadowed by comics,'' said Paul Levitz, president and publisher of DC Comics, longtime home of Superman. ''We look forward to scientists figuring this one out.'' Coincidently, the first storyline of a new series, ''Superman Confidential,'' deals with Superman's first encounter with the deadly substance. It is written by Darwyn Cooke and illustrated by Tim Sale, whose work is featured on NBC's ''Heroes.'' The next part of the story will be published June 20. GEORGE GENE GUSTINES"

China to Knock Down 17th-Century Opera House The 17th-century Guanghe Theater, billed as the oldest opera house in Beijing, is to be demolished in favor of a state-of-the-art theater, CBC Arts reported. ''We intend to build a modern, professional venue like those on Broadway in the United States, where regular shows are offered all year round and high-end performances can also take place,'' Ma Dekai, director of cultural facility construction in the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, told the Xinhua news agency. No details of the design or the opening date of the new theater were given. The Guanghe, constructed in the final years of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), is one of a handful of opera houses remaining from about 40 that the city once had. In 2000, government officials declared the Guanghe unsafe.

Mr. Rankin, left, who has been at work on his final Inspector Rebus novel, said he was being allowed to devote the libretto to anything he wanted, although he would not discuss his choice. He will be collaborating with the film composer Craig Armstrong, whose credits include ''World Trade Center,'' ''Must Love Dogs,'' ''Fever Pitch,'' ''Ray'' and ''Moulin Rouge.''

If details are ironed out, the Potter playground could be open in 18 months. Universal and Ms. Rowling declined to comment.

2007-04-25T00:00:00Z,"CHILEWICH--Simon, long time resident of New York City passed away April 24th, 2007 at age 88. Simon was born in Poland, but soon after immigrating to his new country in 1939, he served in World War II as an army intelligence officer in the United States Army. Thereafter, he rejoined the family business, Chilewich Sons and Company, which became a prominent, international, commodity trading firm based in New York. Simon was very instrumental in forging strong commercial ties with the former Soviet Union during much of the Cold War years. He strongly believed at the time that commercial ties were necessary in order to build a meaningful foundation for the development of peaceful relationships between the two nations. He opened the first official American trading offices in Moscow in 1972, from which he could represent many western firms also dedicated to developing business connections with the Soviets. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he continued to help with the establishment of several new commercial organizations emerging from the old system. He has been a civic leader in New Rochelle and Westchester County for many years where he was active in local politics with his former wife, Norma. Like his father Aaron before him, Simon was involved in many philanthropic efforts, especially in regards to the support of several universities here and in the State of Israel. He also followed in the footsteps of his father with an active support of the American Friends of Ben Gurian University of the Negev, in Israel, and the United Jewish Appeal, where he chaired the Hide and Leather Division on several occasions. With his support, the Chilewich Family also helped with the formation of a number of small businesses in the young Jewish nation. His numerous activities of helping small minority-owned businesses and others became known as Simon's ''Better World Department''. Simon Chilewich graduated from the London School of Economics before the War and had a true love of the Arts. He spent much of his life supporting and encouraging a number of artists in the music and art fields, some born here and others whom he assisted in immigrating to this country where they could pursue artistic freedom. He was later joined in this passion for the arts by his beloved late wife, Virginia Kaye Chilewich, a well-known former actress in her own right.

He was born on May 28, 1950, in St. Louis, MO, the son of Joseph and Dorothy Graham Forte of Ellsworth, PA. Mike received his B.A. from the Pennsylvania State University School of Journalism in 1972. In 1982 he received his MBA through The Executive Development Program at the Simon Graduate School of Business in Rochester, New York. For 15 years he had a distinguished marketing career at Eastman Kodak Company. Mike started Soccer USA Partners in early 1990, a marketing organization to promote the U.S. National Soccer. Through aggressive marketing and national broadcast exposure for U.S. soccer, blue-chip corporations began to rally behind the world's sport and made it very American. The corporate funding paved the way to an immeasurably better platform for U.S. soccer, leading to a very strong showing for the men's team in the 1994 World Cup. In 1996, Mike joined Spectacolor Communications as President and CEO and helped build Spectacolor into what became the dominant billboard company in Times Square, NYC. Under Michael's unique ''visionary'' status, the company built the most fabulous signs in the heart of Manhattan. Mike joined ClearChannel Outdoor (then Eller Media Company) in April 2000, when ClearChannel Outdoor acquired Spectacolor, which was renamed ClearChannel Spectacolor. Michael remained CEO and guided the successful expansion of that company. He soon became a key member of ClearChannel Outdoors senior management team, leading other ClearChannel businesses. His entrepreneurial drive and creativity lead to the creation of what is now known as the company's Branded Cities division, a unique integration of signage and sponsorship of major mixed-use commercial, retail and residential developments. Mike was the consummate professional at the highest of levels. As accomplished as he was, what mattered most to Mike was his family. He is survived by his wife, Jane Forte of New Canaan, his two sons, Max and Cameron Forte of New Canaan, his three daughters, Beth Forte of Rochester, NY, Allegra & Michaela Forte of Old Saybrook, CT, brother, Thomas Forte of Longwood, FL, and his sister Jane Guaetta of Hummelstown, PA.

2007-04-26T00:00:00Z,"HGTV is billing its new reality series, ''Bought & Sold,'' as a ''Dynasty''-style drama, full of calculation and competition, but its pleasures, such as they are, are of a gentler sort. Its characters are real estate brokers at Remax offices in Northern New Jersey, and they seem to be a kindly group, not much given to backstabbing each other or pulling the wool over their clients' eyes. This Sunday, the first episode, is a day with Vanessa Pollock and Sam Joseph. She is a model/actress-turned-broker; he is a former window display artist, most recently the creative director of Macy's Herald Square. She has two young couples who want the same Dutch Colonial-style house, and she really, really likes them both; he stumbles a bit, but not too terribly, in his trial tour with the owners of a historic estate, to whom he is pitching himself. As characters, they are mildly appealing; so too is the placid, passive fun of watching a video ramble through a few houses. But it all seems so easy, if your prism is the dark and desperate Manhattan market (or if you have any awareness of the subprime mortgage crisis). Presumably HGTV's market is nonurban, and the suburbs of New Jersey are comparable to viewers' own habitats. But what a show they might have made with Manhattan brokers. ''Dynasty,'' indeed.

2007-04-26T00:00:00Z,"''Tord Boontje,'' by Martina Margetts, editor of Crafts magazine in London, is Rizzoli's blowout monograph of the Dutch designer's work ($75). Some pages are die-cut in a Boontje design, like a wood-cut from a Grimm's fairy tale, making the book itself a beautiful object, much like ''Until Dawn,'' left, Mr. Boontje's lacy curtain panel made from Tyvek, the polyethylene paper used in house framing ($96 at unicahome.com). Mr. Boontje, who brought an artisanal sensibility into contemporary product design, may be the closest thing industrial design has to a celebrity -- he's at the Tate and, since late last year, at Target. It's not hard to see why: using synthetic materials, he makes heartbreakingly delicate objects that look handcrafted but come off a production line. ''A complex evocation of delicate fantasy, fairy tale and myth imagery drives everything he does,'' said Franklin Getchell, the president of the design store Moss. ''It's impossible to resist.''

After serving his country in the armed services, Dr. Levere had a distinguished medical career that included appointment as Chief of Hematology at Downstate Medical Center, Professor and Chairman of Medicine at New York Medical College, Chief of Medicine at Westchester County Medical Center, Vice President of Medical Affairs at Westchester County Medical Center, St. Agnes Hospital and the Brooklyn Hospital Center. He held professorships at New York Medical College, Rockefeller University, New York University, and the Weill Cornell School of Medicine. He served as Vice Dean at New York Medical College and Associate Dean at New York University Medical School. He was President of Cantigny Research Foundation and Director of the Lang Research Center. He served in leadership positions in many organizations, including the Wellness Community of Atlanta, Resurgens Charitable Foundation, Leukemia Society of America, and the American Heart Association. Dr. Levere was the recipient of numerous awards, including the William Dock Teaching Award, membership in the Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society, and the Tinsley Harrison Research Award. He was Governor of the New York Chapter of the American College of Physicians, a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine, and an active member of many medical societies. Apart from all of his academic and administrative accomplishments, fundamentally, Dr. Richard D. Levere was a teacher of physicians. He taught literally thousands of medical students, internal medicine residents and faculty, thereby favorably and profoundly affecting their professional lives. He served as their role model at the bedside, teaching both clinical reasoning and a respectful, compassionate approach toward patients. He was recognized as a Master of the American College of Physicians, a designation reserved for very few accomplished physicians. Dr. Levere is survived by his wife, Diane; son, Dr. Scott M. Levere, Atlanta; daughters, Elyssa C. Levere, Esq., Marietta and Corinne G. Levere-Latter and her husband Daniel F. Latter, Esq., Los Angeles, CA; brothers and sisters-in-law, Herbert and his wife, Barbara Levere, Vero Beach, FL, and Julius and his wife Ann Levere, Roslyn, NY; and grandchildren, Isabella Mae Levere, Jenna Claire Latter, and Samuel Kolmo Levere.

An N.C.A.A. review of the school found a ''lack of formal instruction or organized curriculum structure,'' according to a news release.

(TCM) ALL THE KING’S MEN (1949) Turner Classic Movies presents two dramas written and directed by Robert Rossen, starting with this adaptation of Robert Penn Warren’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the rise and fall of a rural politician in the 1930s South. At the Oscars, the film was named best picture and Broderick Crawford, above, best actor for his portrayal of Willie Stark, a rural idealist turned corrupt — if popular — governor, a role seemingly inspired by Huey P. Long, the former governor and senator from Louisiana (a connection Warren denied). “All the King’s Men” was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry after the Library of Congress deemed it culturally significant in 2001. At 10, Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason sidle up to the pool table in “The Hustler” (1961), the tale of Fast Eddie Felson, a small-time hustler with a self-destructive streak who challenges Minnesota Fats to a world championship match.

2007-04-27T00:00:00Z,"It's best not to worry too much about the exact locations of the eerily desolate landscapes depicted in Carla Klein's paintings, with their expansive horizons, unpopulated terrain and moody, turbulent skies. The works, on view at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, are simply empty, anonymous spaces, sites between destinations in the Southwest that she photographed -- from the side of some road, from a truck-stop parking lot or from the passenger seat of a speeding car -- and then transformed into panoramic paintings. Each painting, however, bears some witness to its origins as a humble snapshot. White borders on the canvas represent areas where the photographic images were cropped, and black lines mark the borders, while droplets of paint refer to scratches on the negative. Sometimes she has even included telling details, like reflections on the car's windshield, the side rear-view mirrors or the top of the dashboard. But over all these paintings are about the fantastical, even dreamlike qualities of the American West, especially the desert, rendered at its most stark, dramatic, serene and severe through a restricted, high-contrast palette of black, blue, gray and white paint. The results (above, ''Untitled,'' 2007) seem simultaneously familiar and foreign, real and imaginary, pleasing to the eyes and eminently collectable.

Mr. Seacrest also announced that, as of Wednesday night, the special had already raised $30 million. In the 10 p.m. hour, ABC's ''Lost'' (11.6 million) edged out CBS's ''CSI: NY'' (11.2 million). Although ratings for ''Lost'' remain down, it still posted the night's second-highest numbers among adults 18 to 49, propelling ABC to second place for the night in that demographic, even as CBS drew more total viewers.

Wonderful as they are, her latest efforts seem suspended between the rock of genuine risk and the soft place of tried-and-true success. They are too much like their predecessors: radiantly colored, exquisitely detailed, suggestively deflated, discreetly lascivious and rife with decorative, corporeal and stylistic asides."

2007-04-27T00:00:00Z,"What does the phrase ''hula dancing'' bring to mind? For some it's the Elvis Presley movie ''Blue Hawaii.'' Or plastic flowers, cellophane skirts, perhaps even a coconut brassiere. It is unlikely to suggest the image of Hi'iaka, the patron goddess of Hawaii, dancing for her sister Pele, the goddess of volcanic fire, to introduce a sacred ritual. But that's where it all started, according to this solo show, written and performed by Keo Woolford, whose first name, he says, is pronounced ''like O.K. backwards.'' To Mr. Woolford, left, hula is more than Hollywood kitsch. It is an important aspect of his identity and that of his home state. His show, he said after a recent preview performance, ''is not a history lesson or educational device,'' though it does much to counteract the perception that Hawaii is merely a vacation fantasy land. As Mr. Woolford reveals his journey, from growing up in Hawaii to starring in ''The King and I'' on the West End to performing with the Hawaiian boy band Brownskin, his sense of humor is apparent throughout. Created with and directed by Roberta Uno, and produced by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, ''I Land'' features plenty of dancing too -- a combination of hula, hip-hop and even a dose of disco -- choreographed by the hula kuma (teacher) Robert Cazimero and Ana (Rokafella) Garcia. But the show's serious underpinnings are clear. ''We wanted to open this window, so that you would actually ask yourself the question, 'What do I now know about this world that I assumed I knew everything about?' '' Ms. Uno said.

It did provide a list of the e-mail messages it was withholding. They included exchanges last January between D. Kyle Sampson, then the attorney general's chief of staff, and Harriet E. Miers, then the White House counsel, about replacement prosecutors. The list also refers to ''talking points'' provided to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for conversations with members of Congress. ERIC LIPTON"

2007-04-27T00:00:00Z,"A brief art review in Weekend last Friday about an exhibition by Althea Thauberger, at John Connelly Presents in Chelsea, misidentified Ms. Thauberger's nationality. She is Canadian, not German. The review also referred incorrectly to the participation of eight young German men in a DVD that is the exhibition's centerpiece. The participation by the men, who are contributing social service in lieu of military service, does in fact count as part of that social service. The review also misstated the length of the military service that is being replaced with social service. It is nine months, not seven months."

Three other musicals -- ''Curtains,'' ''Legally Blonde'' (opening on Sunday) and ''Spring Awakening'' -- received 10 nominations each, along with the Tom Stoppard play ''The Coast of Utopia.'' ''In the Heights,'' an Off Broadway musical, got nine nominations, and six went to ''Mary Poppins.'' With Kristin Chenoweth as host, the awards will be presented on May 20 at LaGuardia Concert Hall at Lincoln Center. Arrest Warrant Issued for Richard Gere in India Richard Gere was a wanted man yesterday after a judge in India issued arrest warrants for him and the Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty, saying their kiss at a public function, right, ''transgressed all limits of vulgarity,'' according to news media reports cited by The Associated Press. Judge Dinesh Gupta issued the warrants in Jaipur in response to a citizen's complaint that the incident this month, when Mr. Gere planted kisses on Ms. Shetty's face at an AIDS awareness rally in New Delhi, offended local sensibilities, the Press Trust of India reported. It said that the judge, who viewed television coverage of the event, called it ''highly sexually erotic.'' Ms. Shetty, 31, was criticized by the judge for not resisting the kisses and ordered to appear in court on May 5. Her spokesman, Dale Bhagwagar, said she was upset by the news and wished that people would focus on ''AIDS awareness, and not three pecks on her cheek.'' Lawsuits against celebrities, often filed by publicity seekers, are common in conservative India. Mr. Gere, 57, whose films include ''An Officer and a Gentleman,'' ''American Gigolo'' and ''Pretty Woman,'' is a frequent visitor to the country, where he addresses health issues and the cause of Tibetan exiles. Stars Reinforce Lineup For Diana Concert Kanye West, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Lily Allen, below, along with James Morrison, Natasha Bedingfield, the American rock band Orson and the British pop act the Feeling, have joined the lineup of the memorial concert on July 1 for Diana, Princess of Wales, after its organizers expressed concern that it might be eclipsed by the Live Earth extravaganza the following week at the same place, the new 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium in London, Agence France-Presse reported. Elton John and Duran Duran, the princess's favorite band, were previously announced attractions. Organizers said yesterday that the event will also include a performance by the English National Ballet and songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Associated Press reported. The first round of tickets for the charity ''Concert for Diana'' sold out in 17 minutes; another 10,000 go on sale today. The event was planned by Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry, as a tribute on what would have been her 46th birthday. She died in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997. Australia Slams the Door On Snoop Dogg What kind of guy is the rapper Snoop Dogg? ''He doesn't seem to be the sort of bloke we want in this country,'' Australia's Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews told Macquarie Radio in Sydney, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Andrews was explaining that a visa for Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, had been canceled because he failed to pass Australia's character test, which takes criminal convictions into account. The rapper was to have flown to Sydney this week to be a host of the MTV Australia Video Music Awards. Last month, he and Diddy canceled the British leg of their European tour after Snoop Dogg was denied entry to England. He has 28 days to appeal the Australian ruling. Donald Etra, his lawyer in Los Angeles, said he had not heard from Snoop Dogg about the cancellation. The rapper was convicted in 1990 of cocaine possession and was charged with gun possession in 1993 and pleaded guilty in 1997. He was acquitted of a murder charge in 1996 but was arrested last April at Heathrow Airport outside London in connection with a brawl. The Wide World Of Entertainment Hugh Grant was arrested after a photographer complained that the actor had hurled a tub of baked beans at him, The Associated Press reported. The Metropolitan Police in London do not identify suspects who have not been charged, but they said a 46-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of assault and released on bail. Ian Whittaker, a photographer, told The Daily Star that Mr. Grant, above, had kicked him and shouted abuse before tossing the beans. Lawyers for Mr. Grant, whose credits include ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and ''Notting Hill,'' said that an incident was under investigation, the BBC reported. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, 29, whose credits include Henry VIII in the Showtime miniseries ''The Tudors,'' as well as ''Bend It Like Beckham'' and ''Match Point,'' has entered treatment for alcohol abuse, The Associated Press reported."

''The fact that we are again together, I think it's in itself a very important development.'' Mr. Larijani had hinted that the Europeans seemed to be offering a new formula for conditions for talks to resume, but a spokeswoman for Mr. Solana said no new offers were on the table.

Even our local radio station is solar powered. This house isn't off the grid, but when I converted it to solar power, I effectively removed it from dependence on the local utility. I invested $50,000 in the project and took out a second mortgage to do it, but I didn't go solar expecting that I would ever recoup all of the costs. It was driven more by who I am and how I want to represent myself. That said, I do save $1,500 to $2,000 a year on electricity and propane bills."

Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raúl Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than that of a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MISÉRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Misérables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'THE ACCOMPLICES' Bernard Weinraub, a former reporter for The New York Times, has chosen a worthy subject for his first play: In 1940, the young Zionist Peter Bergson was determined to persuade the United States government to open its arms to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. Unfortunately, this production takes a hagiographic approach to its protagonist, emphasizing his heroism at the expense of more complex characterization. (2:00). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (David Ng) 'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood) * 'APOSTASY' Gino Dilorio's fearless play about a dying white Jewish woman who falls under the spell of a black televangelist is pretty good; the acting that delivers it is terrific, especially Susan Greenhill as the woman, and Susan Louise O'Connor as her daughter (2:00). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BIOGRAPHY' A revival of S. N. Behrman's hoary 1932 comedy about a society portraitist and the men who keep trying to reign her in feels slight as a needlepoint pillow. As the play's supposedly beguiling heroine, Marion Froude, Carolyn McCormick never beguiles (2:15). The Pearl Theater, 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) * 'BLACKBIRD' David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE VIEW FROM K STREET STEAK' An attempt at political satire that misses with just about every shot, this play ends up being simply confusing and boring, neither funny nor timely (1:50). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) Off Off Broadway 'DENIAL' An engrossing and timely legal drama about a Holocaust denier being defended by a Jewish lawyer, this play examines the moral and ethical dilemma inherent in the First Amendment and asks how much sufferance can a free society give its crackpots and maintain its individual liberties (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302. (Hampton) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100.

(Brantley) Last Chance 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'EXITS AND ENTRANCES' Athol Fugard casts a tender glance back at an actor whose dedication to theater helped spark his own in this warm if insubstantial stage memoir. Morlan Higgins capably excavates the emotional core of a role that might have seemed generic, playing an aging gay actor reckoning with the end of an up-and-down career. William Dennis Hurley plays the Fugard stand-in (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'JACK GOES BOATING' Bob Glaudini's gentle comedy about pothead losers in love is a reminder of how engrossing uneventful lives can be in the hands of the right actors. Peter DuBois directs the easygoing ensemble, brilliantly led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'LA MAGNANI' Theresa Gambacorta reincarnates the Italian film star Anna Magnani in this one-woman show, which reveals her to be more irritating than interesting: loud and self-absorbed (1:10). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE COLOR OF FLESH' Joel Gross's intriguing play features impeccable performances by Amanda Jones, Samantha Ives and Jonathan Kells Phillips as the three corners of a triangle of love and friendship caught up in the French Revolution. It's no ordinary triangle: Ms. Jones plays Marie Antoinette, and Ms. Ives the real portraitist who often painted her (1:30). The 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 254-9533; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'MUD BLOSSOM' This brooding drama about three generations of suffering Southern women wallows in its own despair (1:50) Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, near Church Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'A DIOS MOMO' (No rating, 108 minutes, in Spanish) Directed by Leonardo Ricagni, this crude, sugary melodrama follows the uplifting misadventures of Obdulio (Mathias Acuña), an 11-year-old newspaper boy. Obdulio is illiterate and refuses to go to school, but he's obsessed with the Murgas, a troupe of traveling singers. He learns to read when his newspaper's watchman, Barrilete (Jorge Esmoris), dispatches him to the singers' practice room to scrawl Barrilete's lyrics on a chalkboard. This fairy-tale touch might work if the movie weren't so pleased with its own pie-eyed naïveté, and so eager to imitate the stalest aspects of films by the director's chief inspiration, Federico Fellini. (Matt Zoller Seitz) * 'ALICE NEEL' (No rating, 82 minutes) The fascinating documentary ''Alice Neel'' -- a biography of this influential, emotionally troubled portrait artist, by her grandson Andrew Neel -- juxtaposes relaxed interview footage and archival clips with more ragged, personal footage that reveals a filmmaker struggling to define an indefinable woman. The result is a film that seems more unfinished -- and thus more present tense -- than other examples of its type, and makes its subject, who died in 1984, seem very much alive. (Seitz) 'AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS' (R, 87 minutes) Not as funny as the title or the Cartoon Network series on which it's based. (A. O. Scott) 'Blades of Glory' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Stephen Holden) 'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott) * 'ELECTION' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Cantonese) This intricate gangster entertainment, the first episode in a two-part sequence from the prolific Hong Kong action maestro Johnnie To, offer some acute lessons in the pitfalls of democracy. Also a feast of fighting, humor and fine acting, in particular from Simon Yaw, who plays a soft-spoken, businesslike candidate for chairman of Hong Kong's oldest criminal organization. (Scott) 'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE GLAMOROUS LIFE OF SACHIKO HANAI' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Japanese) A wayward bullet turns a hooker into a brainiac in this Japanese clutter of soft-core political parody, hard-core narrative nonsense, breezy sexism and penny-ante surrealism. (Dargis) 'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott) * 'THE HOAX' (R, 115 minutes) A first-rate performance by Richard Gere drives this true story of Clifford Irving (Mr. Gere), who claimed to be the authorized biographer of Howard Hughes. Shadowed by the paranoia of its period (the early '70s), this movie, crisply directed by Lasse Hallstrom from an excellent script by William Weaver, is less a morality play than an entertaining portrait of a literary gambler. (Scott) * 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis) 'IN THE LAND OF WOMEN' (PG-13, 98 minutes) This meek, mopey comedy is the film equivalent of a sensitive emo band with one foot in alternative rock and the other in the squishy pop mainstream. The movie would like to think of itself as a softer, fuzzier ''Garden State.'' (Holden) * 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece, independent to the bone. (Dargis) 'LONELY HEARTS' (No rating, 100 minutes) This beautifully photographed remake of Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult B movie ''The Honeymoon Killers'' succeeds better than many modern crime dramas in balancing the philosophical with the visceral, although its villains' dirty deeds still trump its deeper strain of melancholy. (Holden) 'PATHFINDER' (R, 100 minutes) It's all grunting, all goring in this witless period flick about some Norsemen of the apocalypse come to wreak bloody ruin in the New World. (Dargis) 'PERFECT STRANGER' (R, 109 minutes) There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish, paranoid thriller set in the New York media world that even after it lurches from the farfetched into the preposterous, the movie leaves a clammy residue of unease. (Holden) * 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' (No rating, 120 minutes, in French) A film from the venerable French auteur Alain Resnais about love and cinematic spaces, elegant camera moves and six heavenly bodies as seen through a mighty telescope. (Dargis) * 'RED ROAD' (No rating, 113 minutes) Andrea Arnold's first feature falls into melodrama and implausibility at the end, but along the way it is a remarkably assured and complex piece of work, anchored by the director's formal control and by Jackie Dick's quietly heartbreaking performance as a Glasgow video-surveillance officer with an unhappy past. (Scott) * 'ROCK THE BELLS' (No rating, 103 minutes) Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly's lively documentary follows the independent music promoter Chang Weisberg as he struggles to reunite the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan for a 2004 hip-hop concert. Capturing onstage and off with equal energy, the movie is a fascinating glimpse of a dreamer and a music culture that has always depended on them. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'STEPHANIE DALEY' (R, 91 minutes) There is a fine line between a human drama with an autonomous life and an issue-oriented dramatic essay. If this drama about a teenage girl prosecuted for murdering her baby didn't have its ear so perfectly attuned to the tone and language of intergenerational dialogue, it would come across as a dry, cinematic essay. (Holden) * 'SYNDROMES AND A CENTURY' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Thai) Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a Thai director who has become a star of the international festival circuit, makes films that are difficult, abstract and mysterious in the best art-cinema tradition, but at the same time characterized by unusual warmth and generosity of spirit. ''Syndromes,'' suggested by the lives of the filmmaker's parents and the music of Mozart, is a two-part invention on the themes of chance and longing, shot with an intoxicating mix of suavity and sensuality. (Scott) * 'TRIAD ELECTION' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Cantonese) The surfaces gleam as luxuriously in Johnnie To's exemplary gangster thriller ''Triad Election'' as those in a similarly slicked-up Hollywood film, but the blood on the floor here seems stickier, more liable to stain. A brutal look at the shadows darkening the Hong Kong triads, the film picks up the narrative line first coiled and kinked in Mr. To's companion thriller, ''Election.'' (Dargis) 'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis) * 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden) * 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis) 'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis) Film Series avant-garde features (Tonight) Anthology Film Archives, the East Village repository of avant-garde cinema, begins this monthly series devoted to that least commercial of formats, the feature-length experimental film. The initial offering, ''La Raison Avant la Passion,'' Joyce Wieland's 80-minute film from 1969, is a reflection on the author's home country, Canada. It consists of images from a cross-country trip on the Trans-Canada Highway combined with anagrams drawn from the title phrase, a quotation from a speech by Pierre Trudeau. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr) * COMMITMENT AND GRACE: THE FILMS OF CARLOS SAURA (Tomorrow, Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) Mr. Saura is, of course, one of Spain's greatest filmmakers. But for those who love dance, he will always be an artist who speaks vivid new truths about Spanish dancing and the relationship of film and dance. This tribute covers 50 years of work. (Through May 3.) Mr. Saura's magisterial ''Flamenco,'' as much about a nation as about a national dance form, will be shown tomorrow at 9:30 p.m. and Monday at 3 and 7 p.m. Sunday programs are devoted to dance, with ''Blood Wedding'' and ''Sevillanas'' shown at 2 p.m., ''Carmen'' at 4:25 p.m. and ''El Amor Brujo'' (''Love the Magician'') at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday's dance films are ''Blood Wedding,'' at noon; ''Carmen,'' at 1:30 p.m.; and ''El Amor Brujo'' at 3:30 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $11; $7 for students with ID; $7 for 65+ at weekday screenings before 6 p.m. (Jennifer Dunning) FARES TO REMEMBER (Friday through Sunday) This monthlong series of films set in and around taxicabs comes to an end at the IFC Center with two prime examples of this curious sub-genre: Phil Karlson's first-rate film noir ''99 River Street'' (1953), with John Payne as a taxi-driving former heavyweight champ who finds himself accused of his wife's murder, and Jim Jarmusch's 1991 ''Night on Earth,'' five tales of nocturnal taxi rides set in New York, Paris, Los Angeles, Helsinki and Rome. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) FILMMAKERS AT MACDOWELL: THE STUDIO SYSTEM RECONSIDERED (Wednesday and Thursday) MoMA begins a series of 26 films and video pieces from directors who have passed through the fellowship program at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire with a newly commissioned work, ''Seasons of MacDowell.'' It is a four-part film that features contributions by Michael Almereyda, George Griffin, David Petersen and Elisabeth Subrin. (The four filmmakers, along with the chairman of MacDowell, Robert MacNeil, will be present for the Wednesday night screening.) Films being shown on Thursday include work by Cindy Stillwell, Joel Katz, Chris Schiavo, Fern Seiden and Stacey Steers. The series continues through May 16. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) 'MANY FACES OF CHIKA' (Tuesday) The North American premiere of the one fiction feature directed by the pre-eminent Japanese documentary filmmaker Kazuo Hara (''The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On''). Anticipating Todd Solondz's ''Palindromes,'' Mr. Hara uses four different actresses to play a single character, that of a woman who abandons her husband and infant son to wander the chaotic world of Japan in the late 1960s and early '70s. After the 7 p.m. screening, Mr. Hara and his longtime writing and producing partner, Sachiko Kobayashi, will participate in a discussion led by the Village Voice film critic Ed Halter. Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $13. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Tonight) This prolific Japanese band describes its style as ''extreme trip music,'' which basically means big, sloppy noise jams. It doesn't necessarily mean peasant frocks and long wizard's robes, but Acid Mothers Temple usually has those too. At 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; $15. (Ben Sisario) * KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) The songs in ''Simply Styne,'' Ms. Akers's beautiful tribute to the composer Jule Styne, have been arranged into a touching, tongue-in-cheek cabaret answer to ''Scenes From a Marriage.'' The pianist Don Rebic is her witty partner in deconstruction. At 9, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $65 dinner charge at 9; $25 minimum at 11:30. (Stephen Holden) * AWESOME COLOR, DIRTY PROJECTORS, DEERHUNTER, BLACK MOTH SUPER RAINBOW (Tonight) Awesome Color's gruff, retro garage-blues is self-consciously noisy as only New York rock can be, but it is also indebted -- and seems partly a homage -- to the vintage Detroit proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5. Dirty Projectors builds elaborate ''glitch operas'' with stark pluckings of strings and precise, ecstatic harmonies, all arranged slightly out of whack. Deerhunter, from Atlanta, weaves sweet guitar and vocal melodies into patterns that seem both florid and evil. Black Moth Super Rainbow, from Pittsburgh, delivers its shimmering psychedelia through a screen of pulsating keyboards and blissed-out, robotic vocals. At 10, Silent Barn, 915 Wyckoff Avenue, at Hancock Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. Black Moth Super Rainbow also plays tomorrow at midnight at Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733, pianosnyc.com; $10. (Sisario) BELMONT PLAYBOYS (Tomorrow) A sturdy quartet from Charlotte, N.C., the Belmont Playboys play rockabilly forged in a punk esthetic, with energy and respect. At 10:30 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; no cover. (Ben Ratliff) BISHOP ALLEN (Tomorrow) Borrowing from the playbook of early Jonathan Richman, this Brooklyn band puts a boyish smile on spunky, angst-ridden guitar-pop, and nurses worries about the slow crawl toward the workaday adult life: ''Burn, calendar, burn.'' With Miguel Mendez. At 6:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $10. (Sisario) * BJORK (Wednesday) It's been a long time since Bjork's combination of wailing indie-rock, eroticized electronica and use of random musical props -- Inuit choirs, African kora players -- has been truly avant-garde, or even surprising. But her latest album, ''Volta'' (Elektra), still sounds fresh and energized, with every sound becoming her exotic plaything, whether somber brass, tribal rhythms or staticky beats by Timbaland. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $61 to $86. (Sisario) CANNIBAL CORPSE (Sunday) The guttural grind of this veteran Buffalo band comes with a punishing regularity, like some nightmarish war machine. Onstage the band is ragged and battle-ready, with guitars clutched like weapons and long hair swirling in ritualistic synchronization. With Behemoth, the Red Chord, Job for a Cowboy and Psyopus. At 7 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario) CRIBS (Wednesday and Thursday) Jeez, the Strokes really are an incredibly influential band. This British trio, with two albums under its belt and a third coming in July, sounds awfully familiar playing those sneering melodies and sharp, uptight chords. The Cribs do it well, and seem to be having a great, sweaty time with it, but still, haven't we been through this before? At 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) THE KILLERS (Tomorrow) Not many young bands have the songwriting chops to back up their big-league arrogance the way the Killers do. Three years ago this Las Vegas quartet became instant stars with ''Hot Fuss,'' whose adrenalized update of new-wave rock cloaked some of the blasé cynicism of its lyrics (''Dreams aren't what they used to be''). ''Sam's Town'' (Island/Def Jam), released last fall, is grandiose and aloof where its predecessor was sharp and hungry, though it still has a few songs you won't easily get out of your head. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $30 and $45. (Sisario) PAMELIA KURSTIN, BARBEZ, BIG LAZY (Tonight) Ms. Kurstin plays the theremin, the eerie-sounding electronic instrument ubiquitous in 1950s horror movies, which is controlled by gesturing in the air around two metal rods. It's not easy to develop a recognizable style on the instrument, but she has earned a reputation for her lyrical solos and walking bass lines (really). Here, celebrating the release of her solo album, ''Thinking Out Loud'' (Tzadik), she is joined by Barbez, an avant-cabaret band she plays in; and Big Lazy, whose instrumentals taste of twangy rockabilly and the gutter jazz of the Lounge Lizards. At 9, Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, at Union Street, Park Slope, (718) 857-4816, brooklynlyceum.com; $10. (Sisario) * LIGHTNING BOLT, SUN RA ARKESTRA (Tonight) At first it's hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt is being made by only two people. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. In the kind of smart cross-genre pairing that happens all too rarely, the band is playing with the Sun Ra Arkestra, which carries on its namesake's legacy of liberating cacophony. At 6, Pratt Institute Main Lawn, 200 Willoughby Avenue, between Hall Street and Emerson Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; free. (Sisario) MAD PROFESSOR (Tuesday) Mad Professor is a master of dub reggae, the music of subterranean bass lines, eerie echoes and unexplained fissures in the fabric of space-time. At 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $22. (Jon Pareles) NELLIE McKAY (Tonight) Since her ejection from the mainstream record industry a year ago, Ms. McKay has been keeping busy with other projects: a stint on Broadway, appearances at Lincoln Center. She's doing O.K. Tonight she brings her winky-wink amalgam of American Songbook pop, rap and '50s-style bubblegum (''I'm gonna pounce/Meow/Like a pussy cat'') to Zankel Hall. At 8:30, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $43. (Sisario) * MODEST MOUSE (Sunday and Monday) A band so emblematic of 21st-century indie rock that it was mentioned by name in the Supreme Court's decision on MGM v. Grokster two years ago, Modest Mouse, from Issaquah, Wash., links antsy, catchy guitar lines to vocals that are always just a few shrieks away from a destructive tantrum. The addition of Johnny Marr, the innovative former guitarist of the Smiths, has thickened the band's sound without making it any less volatile. At 8 p.m., United Palace Theater, 4140 Broadway, at 175th Street, Washington Heights, (212) 307-7171, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) MOE (Wednesday and Thursday) One chord is all Moe needs to start one of its nimble, quick-fingered jams. Its music starts with the Grateful Dead-Allman Brothers hybrids that most jam bands use, and from there it takes off toward Southern rock, spacey interludes or the borderline of funk. At 9 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. (Pareles) VAN MORRISON (Sunday) Jazz, penitent country and lots of tasty, Celtic-favored R&B fuel Mr. Morrison's incantatory performances, which can smolder intensely or rest in a meditative stillness according to his mood. At 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $90 and $175. (Sisario) GRAHAM PARKER AND THE LATEST CLOWNS (Tonight) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk rock, Mr. Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and '60s rock, spitting out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small. These days he's less furious and more cranky, but he's still holding the world around him to high standards. At 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $25. (Pareles) Shahid Parvez (Tomorrow) Shahid Parvez carries on a legacy of sitar playing that goes back seven generations in his family. He is one of India's more celebrated younger musicians, prized especially for the vocalistic phrasing of his raga improvisations. He is to play duets with Aditya Kalyanpur on tabla. At 8 p.m., Philip Coltoff Center, 219 Sullivan Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 477-5239, virsaonline.com; $25. (Pareles) * PETER BJORN AND JOHN; FUJIYA & MIYAGI (Tuesday and Wednesday) The latest sharp and impeccably stylish import from Sweden, Peter Bjorn and John sets breathy, heavy-hearted vocals over peppery band arrangements that recall 1960s folk-pop. Fujiya & Miyagi, a British trio -- ''We are only pretending to be Japanese,'' goes one lyric -- plays bubbly perpetual-motion figures of guitar and keyboard. Its sound has been heard plenty of times before (Stereolab, Neu!), but it's too fun and innocuous to ever tire of. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * LOU REED (Monday) Representing the best of New York rock's past, Lou Reed might seem an odd choice to open a new club. But hey, it's Chelsea 2007, and that means glitz and fame and velvet ropes, so Mr. Reed, 65, is the first booking in the 700-capacity new Highline Ballroom. His onstage manner, never exactly warm, has stiffened in recent years, but he still expertly walks a line between aloof cynicism and naked, affecting vulnerability. With Okkervil River, a hyperliterate band from Austin, Tex. At 9 p.m., 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) ROSE HILL DRIVE (Tomorrow) Like the blues-rock power trios of yore, Rose Hill Drive, from Boulder, Colo., puts all its attention to bruising, jammable riffs, leaving the edges deliberately rough. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) Keely Smith (Tonight and tomorrow night) This ''queen of swing,'' as she has been nicknamed, may be the last surviving top-of-the-line entertainer from the Rat Pack era of Las Vegas. She is still in reasonably good voice. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 to $125. (Holden) AMON TOBIN (Tomorrow) A decade ago this Brazilian D.J.'s warped, flagellum rhythms seemed about as far out as dance-based music could get. His new album, ''Foley Room'' (Ninja Tune), is just as squiggly and disorienting, though it has lost what it now appears was its most significant trait: novelty. At 9 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $23. (Sisario) TRANS AM (Thursday) This trio from Washington plays tightly coiled, retro-futuristic electronic rock like a band stuck in the light matrix of ''Tron'' (or at least one with a serious Kraftwerk fetish). With Zombi and Psychic Paramount. At 8 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario) * YO LA TENGO (Sunday) The model of indie-rock perseverance, Yo La Tengo is led by its songwriters, the husband-and-wife team of Ira Kaplan on guitar and Georgia Hubley on drums. They prize succinct, tuneful songs about the modest pains and pleasures of daily life and love; they also love excursions into feedback and fuzz-tone. With the Brooklyn psych-rock masters Oneida. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $25. (Pareles) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

(Chinen) TAYLOR HO BYNUM SEXTET (Tonight) On his new album, ''The Middle Picture'' (Firehouse 12), the cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum advances an avant-garde chamber music jostling with odd intervals and useful frictions. Most of the musicians joining him here, like the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara, are longtime compatriots with an established rapport. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15. (Chinen) STEVE DAVIS QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Update'' (Criss Cross), a recent album by the trombonist Steve Davis, earns its title by gently bringing 1950s hard bop into a modern sphere. Mr. Davis undertakes a similar process with his quintet, which features the saxophonist Mike DiRubbo. At 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; cover, $25, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen) * JOEL FRAHM (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Frahm's tenor saxophone playing has rarely sounded roomier or more relaxed than it does on ''We Used To Dance'' (Anzic), an album featuring Kenny Barron on piano, Rufus Reid on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. That group begins an engagement at Sweet Rhythm next Wednesday; on the previous night, Mr. Frahm holds down his regular trio engagement at the Bar Next Door.

(Chinen) * KENNY GARRETT (Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Garrett is a terror on the alto saxophone, and an artisan on the soprano; he uses both instruments to explore aesthetic territory associated with John Coltrane. Tomorrow he shares a bill in Newark with the fine post-bop trumpeter Nicholas Payton, each leading a quartet. On Wednesday he begins an engagement with a band featuring the tenor saxophonist and Coltrane contemporary Pharoah Sanders, who appeared on Mr. Garrett's last album, ''Beyond the Wall.'' Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $44 to $54.

(Chinen) ROY HARGROVE BIG BAND (Thursday) The trumpeter Roy Hargrove has been a paragon of small-group hard bop since the early 1990s. But he has also led a powerful big band, on and off, for roughly the same span of time. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $25; $10 for members.

(Chinen) FREDDIE HUBBARD AND FRIENDS (Tonight through Sunday night) The sleek and fiery hard-bop of Mr. Hubbard's trumpet-playing prime provides source material for this all-star affair, which variously includes longtime peers (like the trombonist Slide Hampton) and worthy inheritors (like the bassist Christian McBride). At 8:30 and 10:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $40 ($35 tonight), with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) SUSIE IBARRA AND ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ (Wednesday) Ms. Ibarra is a drummer with a passion for texture and abstraction, and a composer committed to the idea of cultural exchange.

(Chinen) MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO +1 (Wednesday) As he demonstrates on his recent album, ''Fragile Forms,'' the guitarist Michael Mussillami favors a bright and slippery variety of post-bop. So his trio should provide a hospitable environment for the sharply expressive violinist Mark Feldman.

Opera * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Monday) Bartlett Sher's breezy production, introduced at the Metropolitan Opera in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which the characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality in this tale of romantic intrigue also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast, notably the captivating young mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. Lawrence Brownlee, in his debut role with the company, sings Almaviva, and the hardy baritone Russell Braun sings Figaro. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'GIULIO CESARE' (Tonight) The Metropolitan Opera's successful run of John Copley's production of Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' closes tonight. The countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, who was a fine Tolomeo in previous performances this season, his debut season at the Met, takes over from David Daniels in the difficult title role. The Australian soprano Danielle de Niese takes over from Ruth Ann Swenson as Cleopatra. The rest of the cast is unchanged: the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote is excellent as Sesto, and so is Patricia Bardon in her role as Cornelia. Harry Bicket, a Handel specialist, conducts an elegant performance. At 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer) * 'ORFEO ED EURIDICE' (Wednesday) The Met is wrapping up an innovative, colorful season with what may be an innovative, colorful production: Mark Morris, the choreographer, is making his company debut, along with Isaac Mizrahi as costume designer. Gluck's so-called ''reform'' opera, calm and tuneful and slightly static, is something of a departure for James Levine, who conducts, but not at all for the countertenor David Daniels, who is having a great year at the Met and will sing Orpheus. The four performances of this piece are dedicated to the memory of the singer Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL TRITTICO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The Met's new ''Trittico,'' Puccini's triptych of one-act operas, is now the most elaborate production in the company's repertory. The director Jack O'Brien has created grandly old-fashioned yet insightful and effective stagings of these three very different operas: ''Il Tabarro,'' a grim love triangle aboard a barge in Paris; ''Suor Angelica,'' a tender, mystical and ultimately devastating story of a young nun's yearning to be with her dead child; and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' an irreverent comedy about the avaricious relatives of a miserly old man. Maria Guleghina as the beleaguered barge-owner's wife, Barbara Frittoli as Sister Angelica, and Alessandro Corbelli as Schicchi are stand-outs, though the powerhouse mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe almost steals each show playing three supporting roles. James Levine conducts vibrant and beautifully refined performances. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini) 'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Puccini's extravagant image of a mythical East, made more extravagant in Franco Zeffirelli's grandiose production, offers another look at the soprano Erika Sunnegardh, who stepped in for Andrea Gruber in the title role a few weeks ago, just as she stepped in for Karita Mattila in ''Fidelio'' a year ago. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Bernard Holland) Classical Music * AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) The composer John Adams leads this specialist orchestra in a program of his own works, including ''My Father Knew Charles Ives,'' ''The Wound-Dresser'' and ''The Violin Concerto.'' The violinist Leila Josefowicz and the bass-baritone Eric Owens are the soloists. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $16 to $43. (Allan Kozinn) AMERICAN FESTIVAL OF MICROTONAL MUSIC (Sunday and Wednesday) For fans of microtonal music -- music in non-standard tunings -- this annual festival opens on Sunday with a performance by MicroJam, an ensemble from Boston, and Dave Taylor, the trombonist, who will perform Johnny Reinhard's ''Zelig Mood Ring'' and stay on for a jam with Mr. Reinhard and MicroJam. The second installment, on Wednesday, includes more music by Mr. Reinhard and works by Elodie Lauten, Kyle Gann and Joseph Pehrson. At 10 p.m., Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 517-3550, afmm.org; $10. (Kozinn) * AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Sunday) This excellent orchestra and its artistic leader, the violinist Richard Tognetti, play concertos by Vivaldi and Corelli in their program at Zankel Hall, an acoustically lively space for chamber ensembles. The arresting and intelligent Dutch cellist Pieter Wispelwey is the soloist in Haydn's Concerto in C. The program ends with Tchaikovsky's beguiling ''Souvenir de Florence.'' At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $44. (Tommasini) * CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The British composer Nicholas Maw, born in 1935, is associated with the Neo-Romantic movement in contemporary music. But it is hard to categorize his elegantly written and strikingly personal music, which is multilayered, complex and spiked with modernistic elements. The Chamber Music Society presents the premiere of Mr. Maw's Sextet for Strings on a smartly conceived program that offers works by composers who have inspired him: Haydn, Schumann, Bruckner, Strauss and Britten. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $28 to $50. (Tommasini) CURTIS ORCHESTRA (Wednesday) If the standards of other training orchestras that have passed through Carnegie Hall recently are any measure, the Curtis Orchestra surely won't disappoint. The orchestra, conducted by Christoph Eschenbach, the Philadelphia Orchestra's music director, will be joined by Roberto Díaz, a violist and the new president of the Curtis Institute, in Penderecki's Viola Concerto. The program also includes Bernstein's ''Symphonic Dances'' from ''West Side Story'' and Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps.'' At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15 to $100. (Schweitzer) 'GOOD NIGHT ALICE' (Monday) Alice Tully was so identified with her most visible act of patronage that a possibly apocryphal story has a partygoer addressing her as ''Miss Hall.'' It's that hall that's now being sent off musically to slumber in a cocoon of reconstruction: it will be closed for a season, reopening in late 2008. Its lullaby is a benefit concert for Lincoln Center's redevelopment project featuring the Juilliard Orchestra, led by David Robertson, in a program that arcs from Bernstein to Bernstein, with other works by Messiaen, Wynton Marsalis and Mozart.

(Schweitzer) * LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) Esa-Pekka Salonen recently announced that he would turn over the podium of the orchestra he has rejuvenated over the last several years, so it will be good to see him lead it in a week of concerts in (and near) New York. The visit begins tomorrow at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, when Mr. Salonen leads a suite from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet''; a work of his own, ''Helix''; and Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet. That program is repeated at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday. On Wednesday Mr. Salonen leads one of his most successful recent endeavors, ''The Tristan Project,'' a semistaged version of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' with video by Bill Viola and a cast that includes Christian Franz and Christine Brewer in the title roles. And on Thursday the soprano Renée Fleming sings music of Strauss and Korngold with the orchestra, and Mr. Salonen leads Sibelius's ''Lemminkainen'' Suite.

(Schweitzer) VERTAVO STRING QUARTET (Tonight) This dynamic Norwegian all-female quartet has been playing to acclaim for over 20 years. Founded in Oslo, it is known for its vibrant performances and special affinity for contemporary music. On this New York stop, though, the newest work the Vertavo will play is Bartok's Third Quartet, from 1927. Still, it should be invigorating to hear Bartok's path-breaking piece along with Haydn's inventive Quartet in D (Op. 20, No. 4) and Grieg's moody Quartet in G minor, a signature work in this ensemble's repertory. At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Tommasini) VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel's superb chamber choir, supported by the Manhattan Choral Ensemble, the Graham Ashton Brass Ensemble and the organist Robert McCormick, sings a program divided between early music (works by Allegri, Palestrina, Eccard and Isaac) and music of the 19th century (including works by Brahms, Mendelssohn, Wolf and Bruckner). At 8 p.m., Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * ABT STUDIO COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow) In addition to spotting the dance stars of the future while they are still hungry for stage space and choreography, these programs offer new and innovative dances as well as classics. The company will perform Antony Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas''; the pas de deux from August Bournonville's ''Flower Festival in Genzano''; and Brian Reeder's new ''Ghost Light,'' a collaboration with the filmmaker Elliot Caplan.

(Jennifer Dunning) CHAMECKILERNER (Tuesday through Thursday) Rosane Chamecki and Andrea Lerner, both originally from Brazil, are known for their dark, exaggerated and often raw depictions of human behavior. In their new multimedia ''EXIT,'' they create a funeral rite for themselves in which colleagues offer eulogies and flashbacks as they watch from the afterlife. (Through May 5.) At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $10.

(Tomorrow) Fifteen dance troupes will perform in this four-hour marathon, among them Hilary Easton & Company, RumbaTap and Troika Ranch. At 7 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $15. (Dunning) ANDRÉ GINGRAS/KORZO PRODUCTIES (Thursday) From the Netherlands, Mr. Gingras and his company will present ''CYP17,'' a mixed-media piece that aims to present ''the 'freak show' that is our future,'' as its publicity puts it. Rock on. (Through May 5.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15.

(Through May 6.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $40. (Dunning) 'LA MAMA MOVES!'

(Dunning) LAVA (Thursday) Sarah East Johnson and her all-female company, which specializes in acrobatic modern dance spiced with double-trapeze work, will present ''Tides,'' a new piece that incorporates time-capture video of the Rockaway shoreline and ocean-wave patterns. (Through May 27.) At 7 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $10 to $30. (Dunning) 'LET'S SPEAK TANGO!' (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Well, why not? For the record, this latest celebration of that sultry dance form was choreographed by Valeria Solomonoff, one of the show's eight performers, and directed by Carlo Magaletti. (Through May 6.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $40. (Dunning) AMY MARSHALL DANCE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Marshall's dances will address the beauty of the human body, the last days of Joan of Arc and, to music by Mike Seeger and the New Lost City Ramblers, the textile industry in Spartanburg, S.C. Clearly this is a choreographer with eclectic interests. At 8, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $30; $20 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * MIRO DANCE THEATER (Wednesday) The company directors, Amanda Miller, who danced with the Pennsylvania Ballet and studied choreography with Siobhan Davies, and Tobin Rothlein, a video artist and designer, do better than most at combining visuals and movement to make a third, poetically expressive form. Their new dance, ''Pitch Black,'' addresses human connections and disconnections in urban life. It is set to music for sax and boombox by JacobTV, to be performed live. At 8 p.m., Whitney Museum of Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (800) 944-8639; free. (Dunning) THE MOVEMENT MOVEMENT & FRIENDS MOVE IN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Advance information on this event is about as unclear as its title, but it all has something to do with changing rooms, streaming video and an empty 7,000-square-foot retail space. Reassuringly, the performers include Scotty the Blue Bunny. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Front and Beekman Streets, next to 207 Fulton Street, South Street Seaport, (917) 531-1171, info@themovementmovement.org; $15; $10 ''for those that are starving.'' (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the company with George Balanchine, will be celebrated in three different all-Balanchine repertory programs (tonight and tomorrow afternoon and evening). Then comes Peter Martins's eagerly awaited new production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (Tuesday through May 13), with lead roles performed by some of City Ballet's youngest up-and-comers. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. (no Sunday performance), Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycballet.com; $30 to $86; $15 student rush tickets available day of performance.

(Dunning) 'THE NOTHING FESTIVAL' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The choreographer Tere O'Connor asked eight other choreographers to each contribute a new piece made from scratch, with no story, music or nondance source to guide them. The festival closes this week with works by Luciana Achugar, Walter Dundervill, Jon Kinzel and Susan Rethorst. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20. (Dunning) STREB SLAM 9 (Tonight through Sunday) Elizabeth Streb and her high-flying, death-defying performers will perform repertory favorites featuring a swivel harness, two huge plywood panels and, for the audience, popcorn and cotton candy. (Through June 17.) Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., S.L.A.M., 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, strebusa.org; $20; $10 for children. (Dunning) VANGELINE DANCE THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow night) The program includes new Butoh dance by the company director, Vangeline, and Nicole LeGette. It also features modern dance by Eva Perotta in a program called ''La Porte Étroite: (Apothéose Mystique),'' a title drawn from a novel by André Gide. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Puffin Room, 435 Broome Street, between Broadway and Crosby Street, SoHo, (212) 343-2881; $15. (Dunning) * YOUTH AMERICA GRAND PRIX 2007 GALA (Monday) This international competition, which awards scholarships for ballet study, is usually a big, joyous mess of dancing by talented young finalists and professionals. This time the companies include the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart and the Royal Ballet, as well as several leading American dance troupes. At 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $45 to $150. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by one of the greats of 19th-century American landscape painting has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet-journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape advocated by the English critic John Ruskin. Durand explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. If the show reveals some of Durand's weaknesses -- repetitive themes and borrowings from other artists -- it also reveals his strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan,' through June 17. Japan Society has a history of producing exquisite shows of Buddhist art. And this one, with four dozen paintings of Buddhists gods and saints hung in shrinelike alcoves, is transporting. It covers a broad swath of geography, bringing together 13th- to 16th-century hanging scrolls, not only from Japan but also from China, where Zen Buddhism, called Chan in Chinese, originated. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Holland Cotter) The Jewish Museum: Dateline: Israel: 'New Photography and Video Art,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though, on the whole, the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Journeys: Mapping the Earth and Mind in Chinese Art,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time, the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * the met: 'Venice and the Islamic World, 828-1797,' through July 8. At its peak in the Renaissance, Venice, the Most Serene, was a giant, clamorous Costco-on-the-Rialto. All the necessities, and most of the luxuries, of life flowed into and through it, with many items arriving from Islamic Africa and the Near East. With classic Met largesse, this exhibition suggests the spectacle of two different cultures meeting in one fantastic city, in which commerce and love of beauty, those great levelers, unite them in a fruitful bond. (See above.) (Cotter) * the Museum of Modern Art: JEFF WALL, through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies mounted on light boxes are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Philosophy of Time Travel,' through July 1. Many art historians consider Constantin Brancusi's ''Endless Column'' (1938), a 96-foot-tall cast-iron work designed to memorialize Romanian soldiers killed in World War I, the quintessential example of Modernist sculpture. It still stands in Tirgu Jiu, Romania. But a rendition of it is also part of this installation. The work of five artists -- Edgar Arceneaux, Vincent Galen Johnson, Olga Koumoundouros, Rodney McMillian and Matthew Sloly -- it reimagines Brancusi's sculpture. The concept began with a wish to create an installation that would symbolize the clash of African and Western cultures. The result is seven rhomboids, about the same size as the original, which appear to have torn through the gallery's ceiling, splintering the surrounding drywall and smashing into the floor. The collective succeeds in ridding ''Endless Column'' of its Modernist sanctity by turning it into something more akin to a Hollywood blockbuster than a memorial sculpture. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Bridget L. Goodbody) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Taryn Simon,' through June 24. Ms. Simon couches the show in the intellectual, power-to-the-people oratory of leftist politics, yet she clearly delights in exposing, in a quasi-tabloid fashion, America's underbelly. Though she has also worked in war-torn areas, Ms. Simon is best known for ''The Innocents,'' a series of portraits of men and women who were wrongly convicted but later cleared by DNA test results. Ms. Simon can work as long as a year to gain permission to photograph high-security zones like the government-regulated quarantine sites, nuclear waste storage facilities, prison death rows and C.I.A. offices on view in the show. There are also pictures with lighter themes: the sandpit where the Grucci family tests fireworks, ski slopes being dynamited for avalanche control and the second Death Star, from ''Return of the Jedi,'' at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. Ms. Simon is at her artistic best when her delight in the strangeness of American culture shines. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Goodbody) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown DELPHINE COURTILLOT From O. Winston Link to Anna Gaskell and ''The Blair Witch Project,'' there are far too many borrowed bits in these large watercolors based on staged photographs of people in dark, desolate landscapes. But the larger question is why the images wouldn't do just as well in their original photographic form. Tilton Gallery, 8 East 76th Street, (212) 731-2221, through May 5. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * WALTER DE MARIA Counting and space -- important to both Minimal and Conceptual Art -- come together with unusual clarity, if a bit too much in the way of gleaming metal, in two large installations by the creator of ''The Lightning Field'' earthwork. Both pieces consist of several dozen shiny, meter-long stainless-steel rods presented in spaces that couldn't be much more pristine. Experience the spatial levitation and note the number of sides on the rods; in both cases, they increase row by row. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, and 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com, through May 5. (Smith) Galleries: Other * SOL LEWITT: DRAWING SERIES If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died this month (April 7) at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, through Sept. 10. (Smith) Last Chance LEE BONTECOU: VACUUM-FORMED SCULPTURES AND RELATED DRAWINGS This artist has never topped her glowering black-and-white canvas reliefs of the 1960s, but these menacing fish and vigilant, thick-stalked flowers from the 1970s are second-best. The flowers, especially, amass some of the armed-and-dangerous sinisterness of the canvas reliefs behind their seemingly beatific auras. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'C.R.E.E.P.' For its second show, this small, new bare-bones Lower East Side storefront gallery is showing work by two collaborative artists called C.R.E.E.P., who multitask as performance artists, magazine publishers, performing artists and clothing designers. One of their two pieces is big, polished and brashly self-announcing. The other is minute, hard to find and terrific. As to 127 itself, all I can say is: watch that space. 127, 127 Henry Street, near Allen Street, (646) 416-1517; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) 'Gifts of the Forest: Native Traditions in Wood and Bark' Drawn from the collections of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in southeastern Connecticut, this show celebrates the trees of the rich forests that once covered the Northeast, yielding essential materials to the Pequot and other Eastern Woodland cultures. The objects run from ancient woodworking tools to contemporary objects that carry on tribal traditions. Many things here were made in the 19th and 20th centuries: handsome woven baskets, decorated cradle boards for carrying babies, and an elegant birch-bark hamper whose sides bear a stylized tree motif. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets, (212) 713-2885, ubs.com; closes today. (Glueck) * Kim Gordon and Jutta Koether: 'Dead already' Two artist-musicians collaborate on a show that's partly objects, partly performance and partly in the air. The objects are paintings displayed in flip-through racks. (The ones with glitter are Ms. Gordon's; the ones done in black liquid glass, Ms. Koether's). The center of the gallery is fenced off for action: Ei Arakawa and Eleanor Erdman will do a Martha Graham piece this Sunday, bound to be memorable. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, at Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,' This show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition surveys the revolutionary work Carier-Bresson shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. Here are the familiar and, more interestingly, some less familiar, shots of crowds in Hyde Park in London at George VI's coronation, of picnickers on the banks of the Marne in France and whores in Valencia, Spain. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org; closes on Sunday. (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!' Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin, where the opportunities were better, and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. He became a celebrity in America. He photographed Fred Astaire dancing and Joan Crawford poolside. In the breezy layouts of Harper's Bazaar, the work looked brilliant. (See above.) Closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman) * 'THOMAS STRUTH: Making Time' Through the 1990s, the German photographer Thomas Struth became an art-world celebrity for his outsize, absorbing portraits of crowds interacting with artwork in the world's great museums. As a follow-up, he is presenting the American premiere of two new series of pictures of audiences beholding single masterpieces in the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The show, which cannily allows us to look safely at others looking at art, is one of the most visually sumptuous and thought-probing in the city.

Senior government officials quickly ruled out the possibility of an attack on the electrical grid by guerrilla groups, contending that the power collapse was caused by a glitch at a substation in Bogotá.

It is doubly so if your interests already run to German artists like Hans Bellmer, Wols, Konrad Klapheck or Erwin Pfrang. This exhibition of 22 paintings and 19 drawings from the 1950s and '60s is the first in this country devoted to Oelze (1900-1980)."

Present-day Jindabyne, a skiing and fly-fishing resort, is the setting of Ray Lawrence's somber new film, in which the old settlement, now underwater, is occasionally mentioned. When it is, the implication of submerged life becomes a haunting, obvious metaphor, since ''Jindabyne'' concerns itself with emotions that lie under the surface of daily experience, and with a mysterious past murkily visible through the membrane of the present. Claire (Laura Linney) is a transplanted American who lives in Jindabyne with her husband, Stewart (Gabriel Byrne), a former race car driver, and their young son, Tom. The marriage is shadowed by an earlier episode -- Claire had some kind of breakdown and deserted the household shortly after Tom's birth -- and by the unwelcome presence of Stewart's smiling, meddling mother (Betty Lucas)."

In 2005, state education officials directed Interboro to reduce its size so it could better deal with the issue. The company said the problems were isolated, but its stock plummeted and it was sued by investors.

2007-04-27T00:00:00Z,"These married musicians, above, who are opening an extended engagement at the Café Carlyle on Tuesday, have been called the ''Nick and Nora of cabaret,'' a sobriquet that only begins to describe their upbeat sophistication. They fuse two distantly related musical worlds into a larger whole in which Stephen Sondheim; Lambert, Hendricks & Ross; Dave Frishberg; and Paul Simon join hands. Mr. Pizzarelli is a whiz kid on the jazz guitar, an amiable crooner and stand-up clown and mimic whose musical chops are matched by his onstage charm. Though Ms. Molaskey comes out of theater and semiclassical art song, she swings, and her happy-sad voice is an exquisitely expressive instrument. So deep is her psychological insight into lyrics that you might describe her as a pop intellectual, but her interpretations have a lightness and ease that make them almost tossed off. When Mr. Pizzarelli accompanies her on guitar and vocals, supplying witty musical quotations and spontaneous comic shtick, their repartee suggests a dialogue between contemporary Noël Coward characters. Both have new albums. Mr. Pizzarelli's ''Dear Mr. Sinatra'' (Telarc) is a big-band record in which he emphasizes the sunny side of Ol' Blue Eyes. The songs on Ms. Molaskey's ''Sitting in Limbo'' (PS Classics), produced by Mr. Pizzarelli and to be released on May 8, portray relationships and modern American life as a bipolar roller-coaster. It is a profound pop-jazz album that connects traditional American pop with the present in a way that has never been done before.

Fortunately, festival organizers predicted as much: they are offering a panoply of talks and events that take place beyond the cineplex. The Tribeca Talks series, at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, offers 12 panels on a range of topics. On Tuesday Don Cheadle and others will grapple with the question of whether movies like ''Blood Diamond'' can actually effect change; on Sunday Debra Messing and Rachel Dratch discuss whether women are funny; and on Wednesday the rapper and actor Ludacris (Chris Bridges) will talk about broader themes in music and movies. ''We draw from the films at the festival, but the series has a life of its own,'' said Annie Leahy, the Talks director. There are also activities tied to the screenings. In the Tribe ca Drive-In series, a luau precedes the outdoor showing of the film ''Surf's Up'' tonight, and a break-dancing performance takes place before tomorrow's screening of ''Planet B-Boy.''

2007-04-28T22:16:53Z,"The first two rounds took 9 hours and 20 minutes. That's insanely long! I could have watched ""Gone With the Wind"" three times since the Raiders' first pick in round one. In the third round, each team gets five minutes to make a pick. But the third round this year is longer than you might think. Four teams - San Diego, San Francisco, Indianapolis and Oakland - have compensatory picks at the end of the round. What's a compensatory pick? I had to double-check myself. When a team loses a free agent, the league awards that team a compensatory pick, based on that player's value, as determined by the league. Confused? You're not alone. Let's say the Colts lose Edgerrin James to free agency. The league might award Indianapolis an extra third-round pick. That's exactly what happened this season. If a player has little value, in the league's eyes, a seventh-round pick (or maybe none at all) might be awarded."
2007-04-28T21:29:09Z,"I finally nailed a pick (the Bears taking Dan Bazuin from Central Michigan with the 62nd selection)! I would be celebrating if I had Champagne on me. I watched Bazuin train for the N.F.L. Scouting Combine a few months ago, so I had a good feeling he would be picked on the first day. Bazuin told me in February that he thought he could go on the first day. At the time, he was slated as a late fifth- or sixth-round pick. It just goes to show you what a good performance at the N.F.L. Combine (and some confidence) can do for a player's stock."
2007-04-28T21:13:28Z,The Bears did take Bazuin. I heard it just now from his agent. The pick has not been announced but it will be soon.
2007-04-28T21:12:11Z,"There have not been many shockers in the draft so far. Sure, Ted Ginn Jr. seemed like a reach by the Dolphins with the ninth overall pick. And who could have predicted Brady Quinn's freefall to the 22nd pick? But by this stage in the draft - late second round, early third round -- it's very tough to predict picks. Heck, it was tough to get things exactly right in the first round. But here is a name to look out for in the third round: Daniel Bazuin, a defensive end from Central Michigan. Bazuin is 6-foot-3 and 266 pounds, and he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.81 seconds. I bet the Bears could even pick him at the end of round two."
2007-04-28T20:45:18Z,"It's time for another update on the scene at Radio City. If you're watching ESPN, it looks like there's tons of life here. Actually a lot of the fans have left. Only the diehards are still here, and even some of them have begun to sleep in their seats. Commissioner Roger Goodell is no longer in sight (I bet you he went to Carnegie Deli for a corned beef sandwich). The concession stands are closing up.

2007-04-28T20:24:53Z,"A noteworthy trade was just made. The Raiders sent their fourth-round pick to Detroit for wide receiver Mike Williams and quarterback Josh McCown. This is significant for two reasons. The acquisition of Williams sets the stage for a potential trade of Randy Moss. The Packers and Patriots are possible destinations for Moss. Also, McNown will now be the starter on opening day for the Raiders if they think JaMarcus Russell is not ready."
2007-04-28T20:09:37Z,"The Giants are on the clock. They need a linebacker most but the fans here are chanting for Brian Leonard, a fullback/halfback from Rutgers. With Tiki Barber gone, Leonard, who is from Gouverneur, N.Y., might make sense. What do you think?"
2007-04-28T19:54:38Z,"The Jets just traded up to get David Harris, an inside linebacker from Michigan. It's a great value (and it's the second time they made a trade). There had been rumors that the Jets might trade Jonathan Vilma, who seemed constrained by Eric Mangini's 3-4 defense last season. It's more likely Harris will play alongside Vilma next season, beefing up the interior defense."
2007-04-28T19:30:47Z,"Tony Ugoh was just taken by the Colts, who traded their first-rounder in 2008 to Minnesota to move up. That's a hefty price but Ugoh was a steak at that position (10th in the second round). I just spoke with Alan Herman, Ugoh's agent. Herman text-messaged Ugoh about 15 minutes ago, telling him to hang in there. I saw his reply: ""I'm not disappointed."" Herman noted that the difference between being selected in the second round instead of the first was a four-year deal instead of a five-year deal. But that means Ugoh, if he is really that good, can become a free agent and strike a long-term deal after four years (instead of five)."
2007-04-28T19:21:11Z,"So, who are the best players available? In my opinion, it's David Harris (linebacker, Michigan) and Tony Ugoh (offensive tackle, Arkansas). Both players trained together in Paramus, N.J., before the Combine. Teams looking for a value pick should draft one of these guys. I thought Ugoh should have been picked at the end of the first round."
2007-04-28T19:07:58Z,"Well, I finally got a pick right. I suggested that the Chargers would take a safety with the fifth pick in the second round, and they did! Eric Weddle of Houston. Too bad I didn't mention Weddle's name. Truth be told, I don't know much about the guy. But he should be able to help the Chargers since they really need help at this position. That makes three correct picks (JaMarcus Russell and Calvin Johnson being the others)."
2007-04-28T18:54:35Z,"More bad news for Philly fans. The Eagles just picked Kevin Kolb, a quarterback from Houston. The pick makes sense only if Donovan NcNabb goes down (and he is injury-prone). But if McNabb stays healthy, Kolb does not get any playing time, remaining inexperienced. The Eagles fans were practically expressionless when the pick was announced."
2007-04-28T18:28:47Z,"Down here in Washington, life with the Mets is slightly more placid than it is in Tyler's neck of the woods. The only hot seat for Willie Randolph is the heated seats in his rental car. But it doesn't necessarily mean that Randolph is immune to second-guessing. He made a few decisions in Friday's game that I suppose could be argued both ways."
2007-04-28T18:26:05Z,"The first round just ended six hours and eight minutes after Roger Goodell declared the draft open for business. I keep looking up at the ESPN stage, where Keyshawn Johnson and Chris Berman, et al, are seated. Man, those guys look tired. It was the longest first round in the history of N.F.L. drafts. For some reason the fans cheered when Goodell announced this. Goodell said this was not a record he hoped to break. At this rate, we will all get home early Sunday morning."
2007-04-28T18:03:15Z,"ELKO, Nev. - Sometimes, this week, as Senator John McCain traveled the nation on the official rollout of his presidential campaign, it was almost as if he were campaigning against Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader."
2007-04-28T17:46:14Z,"I just got back from interviewing Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Peyton Manning and Jeremiah Trotter. Well, I didn't exactly speak to them. But I did speak to guys wearing their jerseys. The second balcony at Radio City is teeming with fans from every team. It sort of feels like the United Nations (even though I have never actually been inside the U.N.). The second balcony is where the diehards sit, and I quickly gravitated to the Philadelphia Eagles fans. I expected them to be rowdy, like they were a few years ago when the Eagles picked Donovan McNabb over Ricky Williams. The fans in that draft were known as the ""Dirty 30."""

2007-04-28T17:16:39Z,"I don't know who picks the music they play in between each pick. While the talking heads on television are analyzing picks, they play music with themes here at Radio City. It was Frank Sinatra's ""New York, New York"" when the Giants were on the clock. They played Elton John's ""Philadelphia Freedom"" until the Eagles just traded the 26th pick in the first round to the Dallas Cowboys. I can't identify what they're playing now, but it sounds a lot like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Are they from Dallas? The Cowboys had dealt their 22nd pick to Cleveland, which used it on Brady Quinn. Speaking of Quinn, I wonder how Charlie Frye must be feeling right now. His theme song today could be Billy Joel's ""Movin' Out."""

2007-04-28T17:10:00Z,"Jeff Karstens threw one pitch today and got drilled on the right leg with a line drive. He fell to the ground immediately, gamely stayed in for one more hitter, and then had to leave. It has been that kind of season for the Yankees."
2007-04-28T16:52:47Z,"The Giants and Jets have picked, and Brady Quinn is off the board. Things have definitely quieted down here at Radio City. The Panthers are up at No. 25. This is where the Jets would have picked had they not traded up to get Darrelle Revis, a cornerback, with the 14th overall pick. So let's take a look at which cornerbacks are available now. Daymeion Hughes of California, Tanard Jackson of Syracuse and Marcus McCauley are still around, but none of them are considered first-rounders."
2007-04-28T16:23:01Z,"FINALLY The Cleveland Browns just made a trade with the Dallas Cowboys for the 22nd pick, which they used on Brady Quinn. The fans here cheered when Quinn's name was announced, and Quinn bolted out of the green room in record time. He looked so relieved, and he kept pointing to the sky and exhaling as he walked on stage. Quinn is still on stage now, with family members and friends. He is carrying a Browns jersey with ""1"" on the front. The pick makes sense for Cleveland but it came at a premium. In return, Dallas gets the Browns' second-rounder this season (36th over all) and their first-rounder in 2008."
2007-04-28T16:08:00Z,"Did I write Posluszny? I meant Aaron Ross from Texas. Honestly, it was just a type-o. My fingers just sort of slid over those keys and accidentally typed Posluszny. The pick makes sense on some levels. Ross is a cornerback, and the Giants need a cornerback. But I think they need a linebacker more. Look for them to pick a linebacker with their second-rounder."
2007-04-28T15:54:48Z,"6:45 to go before the Giants pick. I say they take Paul Posluszny, a linebacker, from Penn State. Please, oh, please, let me finally be right."
2007-04-28T15:48:07Z,"The Bengals got Leon Hall, cornerback, Michigan, with the 18th pick. This is one of the best values in the draft so far. This is a player many so-called ""experts"" figured would be gone by the 10th pick. By the way, whatever happened to that quarterback from Notre Dame, Brady what's-his-name? Quinn is now the forgotten man in the draft. Once Miami passed on him at No. 9, we all knew it would be a long wait for Quinn. But everyone was buzzing about him until about the 14th or 15th pick. Now no one is mentioning his name. Look for Kansas City to grab him at 23. Of course, I'll probably be wrong about that, too. I was hyping Quinn at No. 3. I'm now wearing a hat, sunglasses and a fake mustache."
2007-04-28T15:34:01Z,"Another trade! The Jaguars give up their first-rounder (17th over all) to Denver in exchange for the Broncos' first-rounder (21st), third-rounder (86th) and sixth-rounder (198th). What a steep price to move up four spots in the first round. ""And with the 17th overall pick in the N.F.L. Draft, the Denver Broncos select Jarvis Moss, defensive end, Florida)."
2007-04-28T15:09:15Z,"A trade during the N.F.L. Draft always gets the fans' attention. A trade involving the Jets? Well, let's just say the fans here went bananas when it was announced that the Jets had acquired the 14th overall pick from Carolina. About 10 minutes later, Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the Jets had selected Darrelle Revis, a cornerback from Pittsburgh. The fans really got into it then, cheering and pumping their fists. I bet Coach Eric Mangini and GM Mike Tannenbaum were doing the same - behind closed doors, of course."
2007-04-28T14:50:22Z,The Jets just made a huge trade.
2007-04-28T14:39:54Z,"The draft is now about two and a half hours old. Only 15 and a half more hours to go! The atmosphere here is much more relaxed. During the first 10 picks, the tension in the air was palpable. But things settled down ever since the 10th pick. Former Buffalo Bills star Bruce Smith, not Commissioner Roger Goodell, announced the 11th pick (linebacker Patrick Willis to the 49ers). The fans have settled into their seats, and the beer lines are even vacant (err, beer is off limits at this event). Goodell is now circulating around Radio City Music Hall, chatting with reporters."
2007-04-28T14:25:05Z,"Where on earth will Brady Quinn end up? He is this year's Aaron Rodgers, a quarterback who was supposed to get picked in the top 10 but plummeted. Rodgers went to the Green Bay Packers in 2005 with the 24th pick of the first round. Look at the next 11 picks: None of these teams really need a quarterback. Quinn could fall to Kansas City at No. 23. Amazing! The Buffalo Bills at 12 and the St. Louis Rams could reach for Quinn. But they have J.P. Losman and Marc Bulger, respectively."
2007-04-28T13:57:43Z,"I was right! Not about the Dolphins taking Brady Quinn at No. 9. As predicted, the fans started chanting Quinn's name after Miami picked Ted Ginn Jr., wide receiver, Ohio State. Only they were mocking Quinn, not cheering for him. (I just got their motivation wrong. A minor detail.) Nearly everyone expected Quinn to land in Miami. What a shocker! How far will he fall? Quinn is becoming a main story line this afternoon. I sort of felt sorry for him. He's sitting in the green room, and the cameras were all over him after Ginn's name was called. His girlfriend was at his side."
2007-04-28T13:44:41Z,"""Brady Quinn!!! Brady Quinn!!!"" Fans will be shouting his name in a matter of minutes. The Miami Dolphins have to take him here. What a steal. Quinn was projected as a top-three pick in many mock drafts. In fact, I think I just heard some fans already begin to scream his name . Quinn has been groomed for this moment. He spent the past week making appearances on talk shows, hoping, I guess, to boost his profile (could it be any higher?). Soon he will take center stage."
2007-04-28T13:34:43Z,"Boy, did Adrian Peterson look relieved to be drafted by Minnesota at No. 7. The Falcons won't pick Brady Quinn at No. 8, so he will probably fall into Miami's lap at No. 9. So, what will Atlanta do here? Your guess is as good as mine? They wanted LaRon Landy, who is now off the board. Maybe someone will trade to grab this pick and beat Miami to the chase. It would be the day's first deal, and this place would explode with cheers and boos if one is announced."
2007-04-28T13:27:26Z,"By the way, did anyone notice that the Redskins used nearly all of their allotted 15 minutes to pick LaRon Landry with the sixth pick? Didn't they learn anything from Minnesota a few years ago? The Redskins' representatives looked like they were scrambling before submitting their pick with seconds remaining. Minnesota is up now. I wonder if they'll blow it again. Oh, wait, they just picked"
2007-04-28T13:22:44Z,"The Redskins just picked LaRon Landry, safety from Louisiana State. It's a pick that makes little sense. Don't the Redskins already have Shawn Springs in their defensive backfield? Well, all that means is that Brady Quinn is still available for Minnesota at No. 7. Everyone hear at the draft is beginning to wonder, 'How far will Quinn fall?"" I say the Vikings pick Quinn. But aside from the top two picks, I haven't gotten any right! Ah, the joys of covering the NFL Draft live on the Internet ..."
2007-04-28T13:12:29Z,"Like the Cardinals last season, stopping the run was problematic for the Washington Redskins. Will they go for need or the best player available (and then possibly make a trade)? Amobi Okoye, Adrian Peterson and Brady Quinn are still available. What do you think they'll do?"
2007-04-28T13:02:38Z,"Arizona probably would have taken Gaines Adams but now they must go to Pan B. Adams was just drafted by Tampa Bay. Peterson and Quinn are still out there, but the Cardinals have Matt Leinart and Edgerrin James. If they want to boost their defesinve line, Amobi Okoye looks like a good fit here."
2007-04-28T12:48:47Z,"OK, the Browns didn't take Quinn or Peterson. That means they're there for Tampa Bay to pick. The fans here sure didn't like the Browns' pick of left tackle Joe Thomas of Wisconsin, who skipped New York this weekend to go fishing with his father. Unflattering chants aimed at Cleveland swept through Radio City Music Hall after Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Thomas's name. I see the concerns of the Browns' fans. Cleveland now has a good left tackle but no quarterback to protect."
2007-04-28T12:38:51Z,"The Browns pick third and they sure could use a running back. Adrian Peterson, perhaps. Brady Quinn of Notre Dame is another possibility. Quinn, who is from Ohio, has appeared all over the top 10 in mock drafts in recent weeks. Will he freefall, like Aaron Rodgers a few years ago, or will the Browns grab him here? Quinn has a high football I.Q., so it would make sense to take him here."

The couple will be at R. J. Julia, a bookstore in Madison, Conn., on May 9 and at the public library in Westport, Conn., on May 22 to promote ''Green This! Volume 1: Greening Your Cleaning,'' a paperback guide to environmentally friendly house cleaning. ''There are many booksellers who wanted her to appear and still do,'' David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster, said. Mr. Imus, he added, had offered to join his wife, but the details have not yet been worked out. The book was published April 10, just days before CBS Radio canceled ''Imus in the Morning'' after he made racially and sexually derogatory remarks about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. A day after the cancellation, Simon & Schuster postponed Ms. Imus's tour, citing the ''enormous pressure that Deirdre and her family are under.'' That tour was also to have included numerous television appearances, with Mr. Imus included on two of them: ''Larry King Live'' on CNN and ''The Tim Russert Show'' on CNBC. Victoria Meyer, a spokeswoman for Simon & Schuster, said that television appearances were again under discussion but that nothing had been scheduled. Ms. Imus is donating all the profits from the book -- including her seven-figure advance for the current book and four others -- to the couple's ranch for children with cancer in New Mexico.

Mr. Gere's conciliatory statement marked a change from Thursday, when he said on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' that the controversy was the fault of ''a very small, right-wing, very conservative political party in India,'' adding that he expected the warrant to be thrown out. But yesterday, the actor, who twirled Ms. Shetty in his arms, dipped her backward and then kissed her several times on the cheek at an event in New Delhi this month to promote AIDS awareness among Indian truckers (above), said in a statement that ''my clumsy attempt at a 'Shall We Dance' dance move was a naïve misread of Indian customs.'' He added that he had intended no offense and described the charity event as a celebration of courageous people fighting H.I.V. and AIDS in India. And Shetty Diversifies As Mr. Gere sought to calm India's kiss-troubled waters, Ms. Shetty, the kissee and the winner of Britain's reality television show ''Celebrity Big Brother,'' said she would open a chain of Indian curry houses in Britain, Reuters reported. Ms. Shetty, who became a popular figure in Britain after she was insulted by some of her ''Big Brother'' housemates, triggering allegations of racial abuse, was reported in an Indian daily to be starting a chain of curry restaurants in the country, to be named the Shilpa Shetty Dining Hall. Albee Presents The playwright Edward Albee inaugurated a new drama award on Thursday, presenting the Yale Drama Series prize for aspiring playwrights to an Irish writer for a play about Siamese twins, Reuters reported. John Austin Connolly, a retired psychologist from Dublin, is the first winner of the new competition for emerging playwrights, with a prize of $10,000. Mr. Albee judged the competition, which drew more than 500 entries, organizers said. Mr. Connolly's play ''The Boys From Siam'' is based loosely on the lives of Chang and Eng Bunker, conjoined twins who in the 19th century became the original so-called Siamese twins. The play will be published by Yale University Press. Courts Giveth and Taketh Hugh Grant, who was arrested Wednesday by police over allegations that he threw a container of baked beans at a photographer, accepted undisclosed damages Friday from a British newspaper publisher over false claims about his relationships with his former girlfriends Jemima Khan and Elizabeth Hurley, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Grant had sued Associated Newspapers, publisher of The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, over stories published in February. Mr. Grant's lawyer, Simon Smith, said the actor would give the money to a cancer charity. In a statement, Mr. Grant said he had taken legal action because he was tired of the newspapers ''publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.'' Associated Newspapers apologized to Mr. Grant and agreed to pay his legal costs.

2007-04-28T00:00:00Z,"A sports article yesterday about quarterback JaMarcus Russell's emergence as a star at Louisiana State University referred imprecisely to one of his statistics. Russell had 342 passes during his senior season, not in his collegiate career. (His career number was 797.)"

2007-04-29T20:47:11Z,"Last week saw the end of a little drama that had been playing out on the campus of the University of Rhode Island for some months. On April 26 the student senate turned back a committee recommendation to ""derecognize"" the College Republicans because the group refused to apologize for one of its actions. What the College Republicans had done was invite applications for the ""First Annual White Heterosexual Male Scholarship,"" otherwise known by the acronym WHAM. Applicants were asked, first, to certify that they were indeed white, heterosexual, American and male and then to answer two questions: ""In 100 words or less, what does being a White Heterosexual American Male mean to you? As a White Heterosexual American Male, what adversities have you had to deal with and overcome?""Many of the 40 or so who sent in applications recognized the satirical intention (to ridicule and parody raced-based scholarships and other forms of campus affirmative action) of the obviously bogus scholarship and wrote in the same spirit. But the student senate was not amused, and in February the Student Organizations Advisory and Review Committee demanded that the College Republicans: A) not award the $100 scholarship, B) apologize in writing for having violated the anti-discrimination section of the senate's bylaws, and C) seek permission from the senate before mounting any programs in the next 12 months. The group cheerfully agreed to A - why not? - and declined to comply with B and C."

2007-04-29T18:09:12Z,"The 2007 N.F.L. Draft is officially over. The last player picked was Ramzee Robinson, a cornerback from Alabama who went to the Detroit Lions."
2007-04-29T17:24:54Z,"There are only seventeen picks left! Our long journey is almost over. I am relieved and saddened at the same time. The big question now is: Who will be Mr. Irrelevant? The title (and a free trip to Disneyland) goes to the last player drafted in the seventh and final round. Detroit holds the final pick (255th over all). It's a compensatory selection (see my ""E=MCompensatory2"" entry from yesterday for an explanation of compensatory picks)."
2007-04-29T17:13:55Z,A roundup of real estate-related news:
2007-04-29T16:48:42Z,"Things on this end are dragging. We're going into our 49th hour (at least it feels that way). I see lots of people either napping or kicking back in their chairs. The liveliest people here are the talking heads on television. These guys must drink a lot of caffeine. There are two networks covering the draft, ESPN and NFL Network, which was launched in November 2003 and began covering the draft last season. They both have stages at Radio City, recognizable on-air personalities and plenty of airtime to fill. But it is sort of an odd scene since they are competing against each other for viewers. ESPN is clearly the top dog here. But both broadcasts are being shown on oversized screens (without sound). According to an NFL official, preliminary ratings indicate this will be the second-highest-rated draft ever, behind last year's draft."
2007-04-29T15:51:02Z,"It's very moving meeting all these bright young people who won't get into Harvard. Recent news articles make it sound unbearably tragic. Several Ivies, including Harvard, rejected a record number of applicants this year."
2007-04-29T15:49:23Z,"We're getting to the bottom of the barrel now. Only 54 picks before the draft is declared done. The Green Bay Packers had three consecutive picks in the middle of the sixth round, 191 to 193. Were they able to find value? They picked Korey Hall (linebacker, Boise State), Desmond Bishop (linebacker, California) and Mason Crosby (kicker, Colorado). Crosby is the only player of the three I had heard of. He was the third kicker taken in the draft, and he can consistently hit from beyond 50 yards. So, yes, I'd say they found value with such a late pick. And there are other value picks out there, such as Jacob Ford, a defensive end from Central Arkansas."
2007-04-29T15:20:37Z,"I'm always impressed by how many Yankees fans wear players' uniforms or T-shirts to the games. Every time I look down from my press box seat here, it seems like every third fan has a different shirt."
2007-04-29T15:00:25Z,"I was close. Houston went for help along the offensive line, and they stayed in the neighborhood. Only they went with Kasey Studdard of Texas, not Hall. Keep an eye out for Dallas, which owns the 26th pick in the sixth round (200th over all). They might use it on Hall."
2007-04-29T14:56:02Z,"Leana Wen, a medical student from Washington University in St. Louis, and Will Okun, a teacher from Chicago, will travel with Times columnist Nick Kristof on a reporting trip to Africa."
2007-04-29T14:55:54Z,"Houston is on the clock right now. Look for them to take Gabe Hall, an offensive lineman from Texas Tech. Hall, a Texas native, would love stay at home and play for the Texans. I heard that the Dallas Cowboys called him today, but that just might be to set up a signing through free agency. Hall played tackle in college but he is big enough (6-foot-4, 313 pounds) to slide to the guard position. The knock on Hall is that he is not physical enough."
2007-04-29T14:25:16Z,"The Eagles selected C.J. Gaddis, a safety from Clemson, with the 22nd pick of the fifth round. They took Brent Celek, a tight end from Cincinnati, three picks later. This just gives me another opportunity to pan the Eagles for taking a quarterback with their first pick in the second round yesterday, quarterback Kevin Kolb of Houston. I think the Eagles really wasted a pick there. Their fans booed the Gaddis pick, but I think they are just still fuming about trading with Dallas to get a quarterback."
2007-04-29T13:47:52Z,"ESPN just made an interesting point. There are some big-name quarterbacks still out there. Remember Troy Smith? Didn't he win some kind of award this season? The Heisman Trophy winner is still on the board, but his two top receivers at Ohio State (Ted Ginn Jr. and Anthony Gonzalez) were picked in the first round."
2007-04-29T13:22:19Z,"Jeff Karstens sat alone on the Yankees' bench during batting practice this morning, a purple-gray bruise covering the lower part of his right leg. He rubbed the bruise now and then, staring impassively out at the field."
2007-04-29T13:08:23Z,"Here is some interesting info on Zak DeOssie's father, Steven DeOssie. He was a linebacker and a long snapper for Boston College and then three N.F.L. teams, the Cowboys, Giants and Patriots. He played on the Giants team that went to the 1990 Super Bowl. During his career in the N.F.L., he had numerous problems with substance abuse."
2007-04-29T13:00:02Z,"Where to start? The biggest news this morning is that Orlando Hernandez is flying to New York this afternoon to have his right shoulder examined. Hernandez, who threw a bullpen session yesterday, arrived at RFK Stadium this morning complaining of tightness. Omar Minaya said no specific tests had been ordered, but it's unlikely that Hernandez will make his scheduled start tomorrow against the Marlins. Assuming he can't pitch, they would almost ask Aaron Sele (who threw only 21 pitches Saturday night) to go because Mike Pelfrey threw a bullpen session this morning in preparation for Tuesday's start."
2007-04-29T12:30:53Z,"With the 17th pick in the fourth round (116th over all), the Giants drafted Zak DeOssie, an outside linebacker from Brown. Brown? Does the school really have a football team?"
2007-04-29T12:03:15Z,I thought the second day of the draft would be more boring than waiting for the B train to come on a Sunday morning. But we're off to a blazing start.
2007-04-29T11:40:07Z,A huge (HUGE!) trade just happened. The Raiders dealt Randy Moss to the Patriots for New England's fourth-round pick (110th over all). More on this soon
2007-04-29T11:12:34Z,"We already have our first brouhaha. Gene Washington of the N.F.L. opened the festivities by announcing the Raiders as the ""Los Angeles Raiders."" Say what? When he announced the pick minutes later, Michael Bush of Louisville, he carefully referred to the O-a-k-l-a-n-d Raiders. Good thing he didn't mistakenly say they had selected ""Reggie"" Bush."

I liked it and said, 'Beautiful.' He looked at me slightly surprised. The monk said the more standard kind of tattoos like I already had were beautiful, and that the tattoos he gives were not nice looking but rather useful. Each evening after we helped the monk, he said he'd like to give us tattoos. He thought it would do us good, protect us, bring us luck. Each day I said, 'No, maybe tomorrow.'

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Janaki String Trio: 'Debut' Janaki String Trio. Yarlung Records 62376; CD. THE Janaki String Trio, formed in Los Angeles in 2005, clearly regards Krzysztof Penderecki's String Trio as its signature work. A vigorous reading of the work was the centerpiece of the group's New York debut concert early this year, and it is offered twice -- in a studio production and a live recording -- on this introductory CD. The difference between the two recorded accounts is not enormous: the live version is a hair faster and perhaps a touch wilder in spirit. Replacing one with another work would have been better. Still, it is easy to see the Penderecki's appeal to these musicians, whose repertory tilts toward contemporary music. It begins with an explosion of fortissimo percussive chords, repeated with an almost brutal vehemence. In the work's 12-minute span, its two connected movements push toward extremes of brashness and beauty and demand an interpretive flexibility to make the transitions plausible."

''Space,'' he said, ''here I come.''"

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"KAYE--Bernard, 85, died from complications of diabetes and Alzheimer's. Born in Brooklyn, the son of Bessie and Morris Kabikow, he grew up in impoverished circumstances. His entire emotional life was colored by the hardships of his childhood. His family found the challenge of raising their developmentally delayed son George more than they could cope with. When their parents passed away, he assumed responsibility for George's care. Bernard was predeceased by his four siblings. After his graduation from Brooklyn College in 1942, he served in the US Army. In 1957 he married Sivia Karansky of Boro Park, Brooklyn, and had two children, Beth Kaye and Glenn Novarr. With the encouragement of his in-laws, he became a CPA. His passions were playing tennis and trading stocks. Since June 2005, he lived in Portland, OR. He is survived by his wife and children, who will cherish his memory. Donations appreciated: JDRF and Layton Alzheimer Center, both in Portland OR."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,THE managers and coaches for Ardsley's Little League teams squeezed into the child-size seats in the Concord Road Elementary School cafeteria late last month to go over the rules and regulations for this season. Many of the safety procedures were familiar: catchers' masks need a throat guard; no parents on the field; baseball bats must be regulation size. But this policy was addressed for the first time: mandatory limits on the number of pitches.

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"I agree with many of the points made by Thomas L. Friedman regarding the need to convert to a more sustainable energy policy (April 15). But I cannot believe that he uncritically accepts the inclusion of increased nuclear power as a part of the solution. Nuclear power is anything but ''clean.'' Sure, the actual nuclear process produces no carbon dioxide, but the mining and transport process is itself CO2 intensive. And we still have no long-term solution to the problem of nuclear waste."

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"SZOGYI--Alex, esteemed professor, devoted friend and dear mentor. He brought the world of George Sand to light and to life. Natalie Datlof: Merrick, NY $(6$)SZOGYI--Alex (1929 - 2007), who served as chairperson of Hunter College's Romance Language Department for seven years left us on Monday, April 23. Professor Szogyi's academic accomplishments included more than forty years as a professor at Universities including Yale University, Wesleyan College, CUNY Graduate Center, and Hunter College. He received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics from Brooklyn College and a Ph.D. in French from Yale University. Professor Alex Szogyi was an expert in seventeenth century French literature and advised numerous Ph.D. theses. Professor Szogyi is a former president of Phi Beta Kappa and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. Alex Szogyi was known for his varied interests and contributions to the theater, film, food, and astrological worlds. He cofounded the APA Theatre Company with Rosemary Harris and Ellis Rabb and the New York chapter of the George Sand Society. He acted in the French film Balzac starring Jeane Moreau and Gerard Depardieu whom he considered dear friends. He was responsible for Lillian Hellman teaching at Hunter College and was a friend of Patricia Highsmith who dedicated one of her novels to Alex. Alex Syogyi did hundreds of astrological consultations with clients ranging from Whoopi Goldberg and Candicae Bergen to Ruth Reichl and was an expert graphologist. He was a food critic with the Village Voice and contributed articles to both Bon Apatite and Gourmet magazines. Professor Szogyi was a member of New York's Century Club. He translated every play written by Anton Chekhov into English and had several of these plays produced in theater productions including OffBroadway. His translation of Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths is still being produced throughout the country. He was also an expert on the works of the painter Caravaggio. Alex Szogyi was a published Author in the United States and France with works including his novel Carnaval, and books on the pleasures of chocolate, Moliere, and the fables of La Fontaine with preface by Jeanne Moreau and illustrations by Claudine Suret - Canale. Professor Szogyi was a member of the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures (NBR) in New York City. Professor Alex Szogyi is survived by his beloved life-partner of forty-six years Philip ''Bill'' Thompson."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"''COMMITMENT AND GRACE: THE FILMS OF CARLOS SAURA,'' presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center through Thursday, includes five films by the Spanish filmmaker that delve spectacularly into Spanish dancing. Three -- ''Blood Wedding,'' ''Carmen'' and ''El Amor Brujo'' (''Love the Magician'') -- are collaborations with the flamenco artist Antonio Gades. Mr. Saura's 1992 ''Sevillanas'' is a primer on how to look at and film dance; no master shots for him. And his sweeping 1995 ''Flamenco'' is an ode, majestic yet intimate, not only to the dance form itself but also to a proud nation and the men, women and children who perform it, both famous and unknown. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $11, $7 for members and students. One minute MARK MORRIS is opening the New York Stock Exchange and the next he is (or will be this week) directing and choreographing an opera at the Met. The work, Gluck's ''ORFEO ED EURIDICE,'' stars David Daniels and Maija Kovalevska, and opens Wednesday. This is Mr. Morris's second go at the opera, which he choreographed for a 1996 tour by the Handel and Haydn Society. And he has directed opera before, though never for the august Met. But New York City's favorite Renaissance man of modern may well give the Gluck a whole new look, with a corps that includes members of his own company, costumes by Isaac Mizrahi and sets by the Broadway designer Allen Moyer. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 1:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. Excerpts from TINA CROLL'S recent ''ANCIENT SPRINGS,'' a dance of airy and mysterious beauty, joy and humor, are being performed this week in the La MaMa Moves festival. Ms. Croll's performers are wittily individual, and they share the program with the endearingly antic Yoshiko Chuma. Wednesday through Saturday, La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org; $15, $10 for students and 65+."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Tom Glocer, chief executive of the Reuters Group, the news service company based in London, has no qualms about using the photographers on his staff as his own personal camera consultants. He recently polled three of his favorite photographers at the company to find out what would be the best camera to take on his safari to South Africa. Mr. Glocer and his wife, Maarit, headed to the Singita Private Game Reserve in Kruger National Park for a long weekend in late January; they took along a Canon 30D semi-pro digital camera and lens set, as recommended by his photographers. ''I've got the pictures of the big cats to show for it,'' he gloats."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: In similar situations, I have found useful the comment, ''I am surprised that you would say that.'' When the offender says something to the effect, ''What did I say?'' I reply, ''You know what you said, and you look much more intelligent than your comment or your question.''"
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Last fall there was widespread agreement -- and some surprise -- that Daniel Craig, in ''Casino Royale,'' was the best James Bond in a while. It is also generally agreed that no Bond could surpass Sean Connery, who owned the franchise in its first decade. And while I wouldn't necessarily dissent from either consensus, there will always be a special place in my affections for the suave, silly, overblown Bond adventures with Roger Moore. ''THE SPY WHO LOVED ME,'' the best of these, was the first Bond movie I saw in a theater and also one of the first movies to blow me away with its visual and sonic extravagance. In my memory, that Carly Simon theme song played continually for months, though I don't remember if I actually bought the single or just heard it on the radio. ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' will be shown on Wednesday at Film Forum as part of its generous ''VINTAGE 007'' program, which started Friday and will continue through May 17. The Moore and Connery schools are well represented, but what lifts the series above the level of basic-cable weekend marathon is a sidebar, called '' '60s Spies A-Go-Go,'' consisting of lesser-known films that, while not technically James Bond movies, partake of the 007 gestalt of globe-trotting espionage, swordsmanship and superior haberdashery. These range from the Italian horror maestro Mario Bava's crazy ''Danger: Diabolik'' (1968) to Martin Ritt's wrenching and melancholy adaptation of ''The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'' (1965), starring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom, which gives off an existential, political chill far deeper than one of 007's martinis. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8112, filmforum.org."

These works range from an aluminum band shell, built in downtown Miami in 1999, to a monumental sculpture installed outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 2001. Starting on Tuesday, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART will focus on this body of his work in an exhibition called ''Frank Stella: Painting Into Architecture.'' The show, in the museum's Kimmelman Gallery, will feature works ranging from small models to a full-scale portion of a building. The architectural elements will be accompanied by a selection of paintings, wall reliefs and sculpture. Through July 29, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. In a separate show opening at the same time, the Met is presenting Mr. Stella's stainless-steel and carbon-fiber works in the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden. The artist produced a series of dense abstract sculptures composed of found and cast elements. The two exhibitions mark Mr. Stella's first solo presentation at the Met. Through Oct. 28 (weather permitting). In Boston, THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS is turning its attention to EDWARD HOPPER with a major retrospective that opens next Sunday. The exhibition -- which includes 50 oil paintings, 30 watercolors and 12 prints -- focuses on the period from 1925 to midcentury, when the artist produced many of his best-known works, including ''Nighthawks,'' ''Chop Suey'' and ''Lighthouse and Buildings.''

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"EARLIER this year, Gov. Eliot Spitzer reached an agreement with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe that brought New York one step closer to having a $600 million Las Vegas-style casino in Sullivan County, in the Catskills. The casino, which still needs final federal approval and faces a lawsuit from environmental groups, could generate up to $100 million for the state and $20 million for the county a year. But the economic and environmental downside of this deal needs to be more carefully examined. Particularly worrisome is the casino's planned location within 12 miles of the Catskill Park and New York City's water supply."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Keyport, in Monmouth County, became the first New Jersey municipality to pass a law that bans smoking in cars while children are present.

Chatham, in Morris County, rejected a similar ban last month."

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Even though it's still April, the May sweeps period has begun, and this week ABC offers one of the month's most special episodes: the two-hour ''GREY'S ANATOMY'' that will serve as Kate Walsh's audition for her (that is, Dr. Addison Montgomery's) own series (Thursday, 9 p.m.). Auditioning along with her will be guest stars like Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Amy Brenneman, who will reportedly pop up when Ms. Walsh's character makes a trip to California to visit old school friends. Some other May sweepings: In an episode titled ''Rocket Man'' (NBC, Tuesday, 9 p.m.), ''LAW & ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT'' rips from the headlines the sad case, barely four months old, of the astronaut Lisa Marie Nowak. In this telling the possible romantic rival has been murdered, and the space-shuttle-piloting object of everyone's affections is played by Tate Donovan. And My Network TV, still trying to find its way after abandoning one of television's most short-lived programming strategies (telenovelas? in English?), presents ''BODY DOUBLES: INTERNATIONAL TWINS SEARCH'' (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), billed as a ''most beautiful twins'' competition. Last week in this slot, My Network TV gave us ''Ujena Bikini Jam.'' Such, apparently, is the value of prime-time broadcast real estate these days. At the higher end of the culture scale, Turner Classic Movies presents a new two-part documentary, ''BRANDO'' (Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m.). Talking heads, including Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and Edward Norton, share their memories of watching and working with the great actor (Mr. Scorsese: ''Every day cinema was being reinvented.''). TCM will also be showing eight Brando films over those two nights, including ''THE WILD ONE'' (Wednesday, 9:30 p.m.) and ''ON THE WATERFRONT'' (Thursday, 12:30 a.m.). On PBS, ''American Masters'' has a two-hour profile of the pop-music impresario Ahmet Ertegun, who died in December. ''ATLANTIC RECORDS: THE HOUSE THAT AHMET BUILT'' (Wednesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings) includes interviews with Mr. Ertegun covering a four-year period. And ''American Experience'' and ''Frontline'' have combined to produce ''THE MORMONS'' (Monday and Tuesday nights on most PBS stations), a four-hour examination of the Mormon Church's history and influence."

As I ran, I thought the same thing I do after all these interviews: Another amazing kid who won't get into Harvard."

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"A federal plan to redraw air routes over the coast of Westchester and Connecticut drew strong criticism at a public meeting in Stamford last Tuesday, with local residents saying they fear a decline in their quality of life and their property values from more planes flying at lower altitudes over their homes. The meeting was held by the Federal Aviation Administration and drew more than 150 people. The session, one of five public forums scheduled to take place around the region, came a month after the F.A.A. revealed its long-awaited plan for coping with airspace congestion. The administration said the plan would reduce delays at area airports like La Guardia by an average of six minutes per flight, for an overall reduction in delays of 32 percent."

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,THE managers and coaches for Ardsley's Little League teams squeezed into the child-size seats in the Concord Road Elementary School cafeteria late last month to go over the rules and regulations for this season. Many of the safety procedures were familiar: catchers' masks need a throat guard; no parents on the field; baseball bats must be regulation size. But this policy was addressed for the first time: mandatory limits on the number of pitches.

The new system, mandated by an amendment to the federal Energy Policy Act of 2006, will provide backup battery power for all 150 emergency sirens throughout the region in the event of an electrical power failure, said Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the plant; the current system does not have backup power.

Like someone conducting a very personal mock draft, Quinn, the former Notre Dame quarterback, identified it as the spot that he could not imagine himself falling beyond. He had worked out for the Dolphins, and Miami certainly had a need for a quarterback in its endless quest for the next Dan Marino. So, as each of the first few picks went by, as the green room backstage began to empty of the other top prospects, Quinn could still manage a smile, secure in his own calculations."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"It is no secret that some of the richest candidates are some of the most successful. The combined net worth of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey and Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York is enough to buy not just an election, but a small country. The way to deal with this mega-millionaire's advantage is not to open the floodgates to large contributions from other wealthy people, companies and unions, the way New York State does now. It is to offer public financing to candidates who are qualified but not rich."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,To the Editor: There's nothing to make me want to chuck my compact fluorescent light bulbs and leave my car idling in the school pickup line more than a room of billionaires' wives patting themselves on their designer backs for buying $140 eco-friendly cleaning kits for the household staff.
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"The Syosset Sanitation District serves 762 homes in its affluent community in eastern Nassau County. In 2004, 14 people went to the polls to elect the three commissioners who run the district. Several voted from the same addresses as the commissioners. The commissioners met 128 times in 2004, picking up $60 in pay per meeting, according to an audit by the office of the county comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, who concluded that the district was wasting money. District officials said they were providing a valuable service, and no residents were complaining about the cost."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Last October, I bought a ticket from American Airlines to travel from Los Angeles to Hong Kong. I tried to upgrade to business class using American AAdvantage miles, but was told that this was not possible because I was on a code-share flight operated by Cathay Pacific, a partner in the Oneworld Alliance. I now wonder, what is the ''alliance'' in Oneworld? It seems that airlines are making it more and more difficult for frequent fliers to take advantage of the loyalty we show them. -- David Anderson, Jakarta, Indonesia Remember that frequent flier programs are a marketing tool for airlines; they are not necessarily run as a benefit to travelers. Airlines award disproportionately more miles to travelers who pay the most for their tickets. And they often make it difficult to redeem miles. Alliances normally allow you to earn and redeem miles in airline partners' programs, but this often applies only to awards for free flights. There is often less reciprocity when it comes to other benefits, such as upgrades. Airlines' own customers invariably have priority over members of partner airlines' programs."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: I was amused to read in the April 8 Travel section two particular letters from brave Times readers. One suggested that recovery from jet lag takes one day per hour of difference in time (so a New Yorker returning from India would need at least one week to recuperate), and another insisted that nothing short of demolition would remove all traces of cat dander from a hotel room. If this keeps up, some may find it impossible to leave their apartments. It seems travelers are bifurcating: there is the hardy adventurer who wants to climb a Tibetan mountain in her bare feet, dining only on local rodents, and the insulated capsule dweller, who can't tolerate the tea that is 5 degrees too cool. It must be a challenge to serve both types. Glenn Mercer Shaker Heights, Ohio"

Her interest in the fields of health and wellness led her to certification as a Registered Dietician and later, Masters Degrees in both Applied Physiology and Nutrition Education from Columbia University.

The news -- that the local police might have a hand enforcing federal immigration policy -- has spread throughout this historic, diverse town on the edge of New Jersey's horse country, and a few people have even started to move away. It started in early March with Mayor Donald Cresitello's proposal to enroll the police in a small but growing federal program -- now in place in 10 states -- that trains local officers to help enforce federal immigration laws."
2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: So the monks of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal play punk music (''Monks Who Play Punk,'' April 22). They still infringe on women's reproductive freedom by protesting at a South Bronx women's health center and trying to convince pregnant teenagers, poor women and others that it is immoral to choose not to give birth. They should be ashamed of themselves. Donna Minkowitz Park Slope, Brooklyn To the Editor: It is amazing to me that men who choose a lifestyle that will never enable them to reproduce, experience fatherhood or become a husband find that they must picket outside a medical clinic to protest that most painful and serious decision of choosing not to reproduce. Instead, why don't they protest outside restaurants that don't pay minimum wages to employees trying to raise their families, or outside buildings whose owners don't repair homes that families live in? These monks have the ability to make a difference; let them not do it by castigating women. Regina Gradess Inwood To the Editor: I would suggest to the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal that they offer to serve as godfathers for all the babies born as the result of their efforts. Besides begging for cornflakes, they can beg for diapers and formula. In between meditating, they can offer all-day child care, so the babies' mothers can earn a living. Once a week, they can host a group sleepover, so the mothers can rest, and so they can experience what it is to get up for work at 5 a.m. after a night with a crying child. As the children grow older, they can provide after-school tutoring and guitar lessons and can share their nutritious dinners with both the children and their ''emotionally, spiritually and physically'' exhausted working mothers. As each cohort of children graduates high school, they can help pay for their college educations. Once they have spent a couple of decades giving up ''bling-bling'' for the sake of those unborn babies, they will be justified in telling terrified and vulnerable young women that ''God will take care of your child.''

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Accustomed to Ejection With his ejection on April 22 in a game against the Mets, Braves Manager Bobby Cox has been ejected from a game as a manager 124 times, the most in baseball history. Not Just a Pretty Glove OMAR VIZQUEL of the Giants, known more for his defense (he has won 11 Gold Glove awards), is 11 hits from 2,500. Of his 2,489 hits, 2,484 have come as a shortstop, the most in baseball since 1974. San Francisco is scheduled to be home for 10 straight games starting tomorrow. The most hits by a shortstop since 1974: Good Start, Bad Start JOSH BECKETT of the Red Sox, off to a 5-0 start, is set to start against Oakland on Wednesday. He has struck out 28 while walking 7. A's designated hitter Mike Piazza is 5 for 20 in his career against Beckett without a home run. Since hitting his first home run of the season on April 5, Piazza has gone 70 at-bats without a homer. By All Appearances Trevor Hoffman appeared in his 802nd game as a Padre on Friday night, tying Walter Johnson and Elroy Face for the most appearances by one pitcher with the same team. Hoffman's 802 Padres appearances and 830 over all (28 in 1993 for the Marlins) have all been in relief. The Nationals will visit San Diego for a three-game series starting tomorrow. Watch List Cliff Lee should return to the Indians' rotation this week after throwing five scoreless innings Friday night in a rehab start, and he could unveil a new slider when he does. The Indians have not said what Lee's return means for Fausto Carmona, above, but a trip to the minors seems likely. Carmona does not project as a late-inning reliever; he failed as the closer last season, and batters are hitting .294 against him with runners in scoring position. His lone bad outing this season came with long rest, making the long reliever/spot starter role unlikely."

The fatherin-law of Dr. Karen Bacon, The Dr. Monique C. Katz Dean of YU's Stern College for Women, he was a linguistic specialist and an innovative educator who left his indelible mark on YU. During his deanship, he introduced many new programs, courses and seminars at YC, including joint programs with YU's graduate programs, Columbia University, the Polytechnic Institute of NY, and Baruch College; and a cooperative program for outstanding high school students. Upon his retirement in 1977, he was appointed consultant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs at YU.

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"THE BOOKS, a duo of New Yorkers-turned-New Englanders, make quiet bricolage folk songs that sound as if they'd crumple if you touched them. They use daily-life sound samples, including a lot of talking voices on tape behind their own real-time sung voices. The result is meticulously structured and right on the edge of wispy, but it glows with a feeling of solitary effort. And it's hard to pin down in the spectrum of current music, too, which makes it feel just right for WORDLESS MUSIC, a concert series aiming to please and divert both modern classical and rock audiences. Opening for the Books is the contemporary chamber trio REAL QUIET. Monday at 7:30 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, wordlessmusic.org; $20 The collaboration between the saxophonists KENNY GARRETT and PHAROAH SANDERS has been good for both. With Mr. Garrett's mastery of patterns and paradigms -- he is a hero figure for jazz students -- and Mr. Sanders's supernatural free-jazz roar, they cover a huge amount of ground in one 90-minute set. Of course, everything relates in some way to John Coltrane, who is Mr. Garrett's idol and was Mr. Sanders's employer in the mid-'60s. But it's not just a Coltrane-repertory show, and it has a lot of ways of becoming raw and exciting.

Andrew Gerle and I spent the last five years trying to get a fix on Ann Mitchell, her reporter in ''Meet John Doe.'' Ann ruins lives, but Stanwyck somehow keeps you on her side. In adapting the film for a stage musical, we agonized over Ann's likability until we realized it's the moral ambiguity that makes Stanwyck's characters worth spending several hours, or five years, getting to know.

2007-04-29T00:00:00Z,"Two exceptionally thoughtful performers are giving recitals Sunday afternoon, and it's just possible (advisable, even) to catch them both. The pianist MAURIZIO POLLINI, whose concerts invariably put familiar works in an unusual light, begins with works by Chopin and plays Book II of Debussy's Études, but the real dazzler here is likely to be his performance of Pierre Boulez's Sonata No. 2. 3 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $34 to $108. Around the time that Mr. Pollini leaves the stage, the soprano DAWN UPSHAW, and the pianist GILBERT KALISH, will begin the first Free for All concert of the season at Town Hall with a promising program that includes songs by Ruth Crawford Seeger, Fauré, Ravel, Messiaen, Weill and William Bolcom, and piano works by Ives (the ''Concord'' Sonata) and Brahms. 5 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, freeforallattownhall.org; free but tickets are required. The INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY ENSEMBLE is devoting a program in its ICE All Over Festival to music by the inventive young composer Huang Ruo, including ''The Lost Garden,'' from the ensemble's recent recording of Mr. Huang's four chamber concertos, and the premiere of ''Atmosphere and Environment.'' Tuesday at 9 p.m., Mo Pitkin's House of Satisfaction, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, iceorg.org; $5. The festival runs through Saturday, with concerts at several halls and performing spaces in Manhattan. Two composers whose music draws on pop influences are being given a spotlight this week as well. The cellist FELIX FAN and the pianist BLAIR McMILLEN will perform chamber works written for them by ANNIE GOSFIELD, and Ms. Gosfield will lead her own hybrid rock band in ''EWA7,'' a work composed for a factory in Germany.

More realistically, however, given Ms. Seymour's observation that most tweens flock to major brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters, the trend represents exactly the opposite: the desire to be just like everyone else."

Last week, Mr. Spitzer, left, speaking from the steps of the Schenectady City Hall, chided Mr. Farley for joining Senate Republicans in opposing the governor's campaign finance reform plan. Notably absent during that speech was the city's mayor, Brian U. Stratton, once the Democrats' favorite to take on Mr. Farley. Party officials now prefer Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko of Amsterdam, who has represented the 105th District since 1983, because internal polls show him running more strongly than Mr. Stratton against Mr. Farley, said one person with knowledge of the Democrats' deliberations."

His lifelong love of music is reflected in his choice of careers. He was the general manager at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village and, in the late 70's, was stage manager at the Bottom Line. During the late 70's and early 80's, he worked on the road for a variety of groups and performers including The Knack and the Rolling Stones. In the late 80's he founded his own travel company, Travel Tech, which specialized in travel arrangements and logistics for some of the world's largest touring bands. His clients included Paul Simon, AC/DC, Metallica, Barney, Prince, Janet Jackson, David Bowie, Bon Jovi, the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, U2, and The Wiggles. He was a great guy who was loved by all he met, from rock stars to roadies. He will never be forgotten by the life-long friends he made while in the business, including Marc and Susan, Roger and Fitz, Jake and so many more. He was predeceased by his father, Richard C. Joseph. He is survived by his devoted and beloved wife, Meg, who cared for him with so much love during his illness. She was his rock, and she remains one now for all who knew and loved Richard. His truly loved and adored daughter, Florence ''Flory'' Lorraine Joseph, will always be their true treasure and greatest gift he has given to the friends and family he has left behind. Also surviving are his loving mother and stepfather, Lorraine and Charles Strachan of Guntersville, AL, his devoted sister, Linda Joseph of Moffat, CO, his wife's brothers and sisters and their children, who found their uncle to be one of the coolest and funniest guys on the planet.

It also includes film of Brando onstage and on screen, from “Truckline Café,” which first earned him recognition on Broadway, through “A Streetcar Named Desire,” which catapulted him over the top, with stops at “Julius Caesar,” in which he proved he could enunciate; “The Godfather,” his signature work; and the intimate “Last Tango in Paris.”."

Perhaps surprisingly, other signs of aging like wrinkles and gray hair were not linked to early deaths, either. The study, involving a random sample of 20,000 men and women in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, recorded the extent of baldness, gray hair, wrinkles and a ring around the cornea, called arcus senilis, that often occurs in old age. The group was followed for 16 years."

2007-05-01T00:00:00Z,"To the Editor: Re ''At Trial, Pain Has a Witness'' (Findings, April 24): As a chronic pain sufferer, I know finding a doctor willing to treat pain is nearly impossible due to our government's war on drugs. Prescribing pain medications is a balance between aiding patients and leakage of drugs to illegal markets. It's alarming that our government is controlling how doctors treat patients and prescribe medication. Had a medical board found Dr. William E. Hurwitz's practices ''too generous,'' I'd be willing to accept their finding. But it wasn't doctors that busted the pain specialists, it was bureaucrats. Let's leave pain treatment and care to the medical community. Jesse Alt Baltimore To the Editor: Doctors on the front lines of pain management are often caught between a rock and a hard place. On one side there is the real possibility of improper drug diversion and sales, and on the other the potential for failing to alleviate a patient's suffering. A physician can end up a defendant in a criminal trial or a defendant in a civil lawsuit. Chronic pain is not like an infection. There aren't concrete tests that can prove its existence. One must rely on the patient's description. There are inherent risks, but collaborative groups of physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners have developed some truly effective ways of preventing drug diversion and setting standards for prescribing them.

2007-05-01T00:00:00Z,"'Sesame Street' Takes On a Role in the Middle East ''Sesame Street'' is returning to Israel and the Palestinian territories. Years after the original episodes went off television because of a lack of financing, the show is returning in Israeli and Palestinian versions, The Associated Press reported. For the first time, the Israeli version, ''Rechov Sumsum,'' will feature an Israeli Muppet of Arab origin, Mahoub, who speaks Hebrew and Arabic. And new human actors will include Russian and Ethiopian Jewish immigrants, who have been unwelcome to some Israelis. The Palestinian show, ''Shara'a Simsim,'' seeks to offer positive role models to boys in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gary Knell, the president of Sesame Workshop, the New York-based nonprofit organization behind ''Sesame Street'' programming worldwide, said, ''There's a desire of the political leaders to change the endless debate that seems to be passed down from generation to generation.'' New Law to Protect Critics From Being Misquoted The European Commission has passed legislation that would keep bad reviews from looking good, the London newspaper The Independent reported. The measure, to take effect in December, will make it illegal for advertisers to misquote reviewers by taking a positive word or phrase from a theater review if it gives a misleading sense of the whole review. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive bars advertising that includes ''false information'' or any claim that ''deceives or is likely to deceive the consumer'' and thus ''causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.'' Helen Kearns, the commission's spokeswoman on consumer affairs, said the measure would be ''policed on a case-by-case basis'' by the Office of Fair Trading. ''It should apply to misleading advertising right across the board,'' she added, ''from airline tickets to theater tickets.'' Egypt Seeks Loan Of Museum Antiquities Egypt plans to appeal to museums abroad for the temporary return of some of its most precious artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone and a bust of Nefertiti, above, The Associated Press reported. Zahi Hawass, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the Foreign Ministry would send letters this week to France, Germany, the United States and Britain asking for the loan of the ancient works, to be exhibited either in 2011 at the opening of the Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids at Giza or in 2010 at the opening of the Atum Museum in the Nile Delta city of Meniya. The 1,680-pound Rosetta Stone, a key to deciphering ancient hieroglyphics, is in the British Museum, where a spokeswoman, Hannah Boulton, said a loan request would be considered. Germany has already balked at requests to lend the 3,000-year-old bust of Nefertiti from its Egyptian Museum in Berlin. Mr. Hawass said he was also seeking the zodiac ceiling painting from the Dendera Temple, now in the Louvre; the statue of Hemiunu in the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim, near Hanover, Germany; and the bust of Anchhaf at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

The European tour will take her to Paris on June 26, Nice on July 10 and Dublin on July 14. The promoters said additional dates would be announced shortly.

So the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends screening for H.I.V. as a routine part of health care, and not just for people in known risk groups. With other sexually transmitted diseases, or S.T.D.'s, the usefulness and cost effectiveness of testing depend on the population being screened. Although general screening for all S.T.D.'s is not recommended, pregnant women, adolescents and gay men require special attention, and there are times when even people who fall into none of these groups should also be tested."

But the several hundred thousand elderly homeowners who are eligible for higher benefits saw almost no increase when tax exemptions and rebate checks available under the program were taken into consideration. “It’s clear we have the resources available to give seniors greater tax relief,” Joseph L.

Mr. McMahon was cleared of that allegation, but investigators found that he had allowed his administrative assistant to type a poem for his daughter while she was visiting his Council office. Mr. McMahon also had his assistant call parents of a youth soccer team he coached to tell them of scheduling changes or that he would be late for games or practices because of Council-related business. Mr. McMahon, who did not dispute the findings, said his staff would no longer perform personal tasks because “that is the strict letter of the rules.” The board recommended no fines or penalties, given the limited nature of the violation. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said she would refer the findings to the Council’s Standards and Ethics Committee for further review."

The son of a Turkish diplomat, he exported that sound to England, where he merged it with a European sensibility, and then brought it back to the United States, where he started an independent label with Herb Abramson and a $10,000 loan from his dentist. One result was the boogie-based, saxophone-driven “Atlantic Sound,” which changed the face of contemporary American music. Mr. Ertegun’s roster at Atlantic Records included Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, LaVern Baker and the Drifters.

The dancing, choreographed by Royston Maldoom and rehearsed for nearly eight weeks by the schoolchildren from the Choir Academy of Harlem, the Bread and Roses Integrated Arts High School, Public School 153 and Public School 161, will take place on Nov. 17 and 18. Designed by Thomas W. Lamb (1871-1942), one of the foremost American theater architects of the 19th and 20th centuries, the United Palace Theater opened in 1930 as Loew's 175th Street, seating more than 3,000. On Nov. 13, 14 and 16, the Berlin Philharmonic is to appear at Carnegie Hall, where it will perform Mahler's Symphony No. 9, ''The Song of the Earth,'' and the unfinished Symphony No. 10 in the version by Deryck Cooke. Twain Prize for Crystal Billy Crystal, below, was named yesterday to receive the 10th annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The honor will be bestowed on Oct. 11 at the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington and broadcast nationwide by PBS in the fall. In a statement, Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman of Kennedy Center, said: ''The work he has created for stage, film and television has made an indelible impression. It is the work of not just a humorist but also a humanist.'' Mr. Crystal, who said he was honored to receive an award previously given to Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and Neil Simon, said, ''As my grandfather said, if you hang around the store long enough, once in a while they'll give you something.'' Scientists Fiddle And Out Comes a Strad In the latest miracle of modern science, researchers at Manchester University in England say they have developed an electronic device that can make a cheap violin sound like a rare Stradivarius, The Guardian of London reported. The device is called the Sound Wizard. Patrick Gaydecki, a professor of digital signal processing who leads the research team, said: ''The violin is like a bell or any resonant system. It vibrates with a characteristic signature.'' To extract the signature, the researchers use a laser pulse to record the vibrations before subtracting from the full violin sound the sound of the strings, which is essentially the same for every violin. Then they give the resulting sound the amplification provided by the body of a Stradivarius. ''In effect, the processing system becomes the violin body,'' Dr. Gaydecki said. Magicians Seek Cash For Coin Trick Exposure Forty-nine Japanese magicians have sued two Japanese television networks for showing viewers the secret behind their coin tricks, Agence France-Presse reported. The magicians are seeking 1.97 million yen ($16,400) -- and apologies -- from Nippon Television Network and TV Asahi. ''There was no need to reveal the secrets of tricks, and the defendants infringed upon the value of secrets of tricks, which are assets shared by magicians,'' the group of plaintiffs said in the lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court. In November the networks' news programs showed how coin tricks were done, after the arrest of a magician and a pub operator for punching holes in coins for use in sleight of hand. Japanese law bars damaging or melting coins. Shintaro Fujiyama, 52, a plaintiff, said: ''It takes us many years to develop a coin trick as a professional tool. They must understand how all the time we have spent is wasted by exposure of the trick.'' Nippon TV declined to comment. TV Asahi said it believed there was no problem with its program. A Baby Girl for Star Of 'Whale Rider' Keisha Castle-Hughes, 17, below, who became the youngest actress nominated for the Academy Award for best actress when she appeared on the ballot in 2004 for her performance in the 2003 New Zealand film ''Whale Rider,'' gave birth to a girl last Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported. Gail Cowan, her manager, said Felicity-Amore, the seven-pound, six-ounce infant, was ''beautiful.'' In a television interview broadcast last week, Ms. Castle-Hughes said she had wanted to hide after a public controversy over her pregnancy by her boyfriend, Bradley Hull, 19. ''I felt like it was bad for me to be happy about it,'' she said. Last year, she starred as the Virgin Mary in ''The Nativity Story.''

2007-05-02T00:00:00Z,"One week after returning to Monday's schedule with reduced yet still potent ratings, NBC's ''Heroes'' eked out another win as the night's highest-rated show among adults 18 to 49. Despite earning some of its lowest ratings of the season, the science-fiction drama remains especially popular among younger demographics. In total viewers, ''Heroes'' drew 11.9 million at 9 p.m., according to Nielsen's estimates, far fewer than either ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars'' from 8 to 9:45 (18.5 million) or CBS's ''CSI: Miami'' at 10 (17.2 million). ABC finished first for the night, followed by CBS. NBC ranked third, dragged down in the 10 p.m. hour by low ratings for ''The Real Wedding Crashers'' (5.9 million). Fox was fourth over all. Its serial drama ''24'' once again finished last at 9, but it attracted a slightly improved 10.8 million viewers largely due to the substitution of a ''House'' repeat at 8 (7.2 million) in place of ''Drive,'' which was pulled from Fox's schedule just weeks after its April 15 premiere.

They are roughly the same age (let's say over 50), their roots are in Veracruz -- their food shows it -- and they learned to cook at home from their mothers and grandmothers. After leaving home, they were essentially self-taught, came to the restaurant business more or less by accident and became symbols of strong, independent women in an industry long dominated by men. Most important, they run two of the best and most distinctive restaurants in Mexico City.

Abe will be remembered by his friends and family as a man who lived life to the fullest. Whether it was zip gliding with his grandkids to celebrating his 75th birthday, traveling the world with me, or dancing the night away, he did everything with gusto and a smile on his face. He was a dedicated businessman who started with nothing and built a successful electronics sales company. Abe was a friend to everyone; he would kibbitz with everyone he met from the server in a restaurant, a taxi driver, and the unsuspecting Chinese food delivery man. His family will especially remember the love he showed them and the wonderful example he set by seemingly enjoying every moment of every day. He embraced his extended family as if they were his own and cherished the time he spent with all of us. I will miss him.

But if we are truly interested in a sustainable food system, we must consider the producer's point of view as well as the consumer's. From the producer's perspective, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, olive oil and wine are products that could not survive if they had to depend on local-only consumption. ''Locavores'' should understand that there's a difference between indulging in tasteless midwinter raspberries and supporting the efforts of indigenous farmers whose livings depend on offering their unique products to a global market."

He was born in Holyoke, MA, graduated with the class of 1950 from Harvard College, and received his LLB in 1953 from the Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he was an editor of The Crimson and a member of the Signet Society. He served as a lieutenant in the USN. As a young lawyer at Watson and Leavenworth, he developed an interest in trademark law and was recognized as an authority in the field; he was senior counsel at Hunton and Williams when he died. He served as Secretary of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and, later, on its Executive Committee. In 1971, he accompanied the U.S. Antarctic Policy Group South Pole Expedition and planted an anniversary-year flag of the Bar Association at the Pole. After college, George established the Caleb Cheeshahteamuck 1665 Fund at Harvard in memory of its first Native American student. He was the longest serving Secretary of the Harvard Club of New York and a trustee of Hancock Shaker Village. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, his daughter, Alice Truax, his sons, Hawley and Charles Truax, his daughters-in-law, Jane Thrailkill and Julie Truax, and his grandchildren, Olivia, Naomi, and George.

2007-05-02T00:00:00Z,"Stuck in a marriage to a man she loathes, inconveniently pregnant with his child, oppressed by long hours waiting tables for a grouchy boss, Jenna finds relief baking pies. As lovingly filmed as they are made, these creations serve as both therapy and art. Jenna gives them whimsical names -- ''I don't want Earl's baby pie,'' for instance -- and combines unlikely ingredients to unfailingly delicious effect. Adrienne Shelly, who wrote and directed ''Waitress'' (and who plays one of Jenna's co-workers), demonstrates a similar confectionary gift. The movie, her third and last feature before she was murdered in November, blends familiar elements into something both satisfying and surprising. Part feminist fable, part romantic fairy tale, it is by turns tart and sweet, charming and tough, rather like its heroine and like Keri Russell, the plucky, pretty, nimble actress (still perhaps best known as Felicity, from the television coming-of-age melodrama of the same name) who plays her."

The Investigative Commission on Pro-Japanese Collaborators&#8217; Property said the nine were Lee Wan-yong, Song Byung-joon and Kwon Jung-hyun, and six others. As reward for their work, they received Japanese court titles and money from Tokyo. &#8220;This is only the beginning,&#8221; a spokesman of the commission said, adding that the agency would continue investigating and confiscating assets acquired as a result of collaborating with Japan. Under a special law enacted in 2005, the commission has listed 452 people who collaborated with the 1910-1945 colonization. The land that was seized by the state was estimated to be worth $3.9 million.

The Nomad has a podlike shape; a minimalist frame made of bamboo, top and bottom left; a WeatherMax fabric cover, center left; and a modular plywood floor. The structure is 12 feet wide and 7 feet tall, and sells for $8,300."

2007-05-03T00:00:00Z,"As they gather Thursday night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for their first debate, the Republican presidential candidates are thrilled at the chance to associate themselves with Reagan. But they may not be able to escape the challenge created for them by the current president. As much as Iraq or health care or any other issue, the question of how to deal with President Bush is vexing the Republican field. Do they embrace him as a means of appealing to the conservative voters who tend to decide Republican primaries? Or do they break from him in an effort to show that they will lead the nation in a new direction? Do they applaud his policies or question his competence -- or both?"

There were 27,817 fires in 2006, according to the Fire Department -- not 6,023, which was the number of fires investigated that year. In the early 1980s, fire marshals investigated about 13,000 fires a year; that is not the number they fought."

2007-05-03T00:00:00Z,"The heirs of a Dutch art dealer whose collection was seized by the Nazis during World War II and a California art foundation that bought an artwork confiscated by the Soviet officials in the late 1920s have filed lawsuits against each other in federal court in Los Angeles over the ownership of a 16th-century diptych now hanging in the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena. The work, ''Adam and Eve,'' right, is a pair of life-size oil paintings on wood panels created around 1530 by Lucas Cranach the Elder. The paintings were appraised last year for insurance purposes at $24 million. The Norton Simon Foundation, which has lent the works to the similarly named museum, bought them at auction in 1970 and 1971 from an heir to the Stroganoff dynasty of Russia. Around 1930 they were sold at auction by Soviet officials to the Dutch art dealer Jacques Goudstikker. Seized by the Nazis, the works were returned after World War II to the Dutch government, which recognized the Stroganoff family as the rightful owner and transferred ownership to it. Now Marei Von Saher, a Connecticut heir of Mr. Goudstikker, has laid claim to the works. In the lawsuits each side asks the court to rule that it has lawful title to the art. EDWARD WYATT"

2007-05-03T00:00:00Z,"Britney Spears Back Onstage, Briefly Wearing knee-high go-go boots, a short white skirt and a sparkly pink bra, showing off her navel decoration, a brown-wigged Britney Spears turned up at the House of Blues in San Diego late Tuesday night to deliver a brief five-song set that kicked off with her classic ''Baby One More Time,'' The Associated Press reported. The appearance by Ms. Spears, 25, was believed to be her first public concert performance in nearly three years. Backed by four dancers and using a cafe chair as a prop, Ms. Spears pranced around the small stage singing songs from her albums, albeit for less than 15 minutes. Rumors of an impending appearance had spread on the Internet and on local radio, prompting a run on tickets that packed the club, where some members of the audience paid upward of $125 each. The marquee advertised only a show by ''The M+Ms,'' and not until an hour after the doors opened did a disc jockey mention Ms. Spears's name. In the last year she has spent time in a rehabilitation facility after bizarre behavior that included shaving her head, being tattooed and attacking a car with an umbrella. She also reached a divorce settlement with Kevin Federline, with whom she has two children. In January she wrote on her Web site, ''I look forward to coming back this year bigger and better than ever.'' Here Comes the Queen A new formal portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, snapped by the photographer Annie Leibovitz, whose works include a naked, very pregnant Demi Moore and a nude John Lennon hugging a clothed Yoko Ono, has divided the critics, Reuters reported. Taken at Buckingham Palace to commemorate the queen's six-day visit to the United States, beginning today, the photograph drew praise from British critics and a thumbs down from The Washington Post's culture critic Henry Allen, who told BBC Radio it had ''all the personality of a marble bust of George Washington.'' But the British critic William Feaver expressed satisfaction with the traditional pose. ''You do not want to see Her Majesty break-dancing or bathing in a vat of asses' milk,'' he told BBC Radio. Berlin Philharmonic To Revisit Nazi Era The Berlin Philharmonic has agreed to cooperate in an investigation of its role during the Nazi era, Agence France-Presse reported. ''We've never really come to terms with the history of the Philharmonic Orchestra under National Socialism,'' Pamela Rosenberg, the general manager, said in Berlin. A book, to be published this year, will focus on the period from 1933 to 1945 and particularly on the ambiguous relationship between the orchestra's renowned conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler and leading Nazis. A film for public television and an exhibition on the subject are also planned. Mr. Furtwängler was chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic from 1922 to 1945 and from 1952 until his death in 1954. Often deferential toward the Nazis, who used him as a propaganda tool, he also worked to protect his Jewish musicians. Although his reputation was tainted, after World War II his name was cleared. Warner Brothers Options Frank Miller's 'Ronin' ''Ronin,'' a new movie adapted from a graphic novel by Frank Miller, below, the creator of ''300,'' has begun its journey to the screen. Warner Brothers optioned the rights to the novel for a live-action feature film to be directed by Sylvain White (''Stomp the Yard''), Variety.com reported. In the novel, published by DC Comics, a ronin, or disgraced samurai warrior, bears the responsibility for the assassination of his master by a shape-shifting demon in Japan in the 13th century. When the master's sword is unearthed in New York in the 21st century, the ronin and demon return to life, battling mutants and thugs for the mythical weapon."
