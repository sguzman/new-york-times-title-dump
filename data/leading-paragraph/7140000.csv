Loving and devoted husband of Cynthia, father of Margaret and Katherine; stepfather of Jodi and Jonathan; grandfather of Lydia, Charles and Nicholas. After being graduated from CCNY and the prestigious Berlin Medical School, Sam returned to New York in 1938 where he served a residence in Bellevue Hospital, specializing in radiology. He served with distinction as Captain in the Pacific area during World War II. On a beachhead in Okinawa, he witnessed the first Kamikaze raid -on a battleship. His versatility and resourcefulness was obvious, when he created a makeshift viewer on the beach by stringing x-rays of the wounded on a line, reading them with the aid of sunlight. After the war, Sam returned home and got married. The union produced two daughters, Meg and Kathy. Following the death of his first wife, Sam met and married the love of his life, Cynthia in 1954. With her he raised Jonathan and Jodi, ran a successful radiology practice in Brooklyn and headed the Department of Radiology at Sea View Hospital, Staten Island. There he made a significant contribution to the cure of Tuberculosis, then rampant in New York City. Additionally, he was medical director of the Midwood HIP Group in Brooklyn as well as Chief Radiologist of the outpatient VA Clinics in Brooklyn and Queens. Sam was a quiet scholar all his life engaging himself in biomedical research and developments in medical technology. He was an avid fan of Lincoln and his collection boasts a library of Civil war books and memorabilia. He lived a wonderful 96 years, earning the love, respect and admiration of his peers, both social and professional. His generosity of spirit made him a remarkable human being. His deeds and effortless compassion personified grace and goodness as he embraced life in all its aspects. He had the ability to relate to the world in a quiet, unassuming manner. His stature belied the giant he was in character and loving-kindness. After 55 years of a wonderfully happy marriage, his final words to Cynthia, spoken in a loud, clear voice were ''words cannot tell how much I have loved you.'' He showed the greatest of courage as her devoted companion and every effort he made for his family was with great commitment and enthusiasm. Funeral services will be held at the Riverside Gordon Memorial Chapel, 7205 West Atlantic Avenue, Delray Beach, FL 33446 on Sunday November 9 at 2:00pm. Graveside funeral follows at Beth Moses, Long Island, New York on Tuesday November 11 at 2:00pm."

Perhaps you‚Äôve heard of Marie-H√©l√®ne? For just shy of four decades, this daughter of a titled Dutch diplomat and an eccentric Egyptian socialite ruled tout Paris through a cocktail of fear and intimidation, a prickly charisma that left its targets exhausted, and fancy-dress balls on a scale and level of inventiveness that died when she did, at the age of 65 in 1996. Married to Baron Guy de Rothschild, the diffident patriarch of the French branch of the banking family, she did not lack for resources, a fact extravagantly affirmed by her wardrobe. Marie-H√©l√®ne reached her sartorial apotheosis at Longchamp in the 1970s, cinching a leopard coat over her small frame and topping her strawberry tonsorial sweep with a bowler."

In the Bay Area, Open Restaurant was started by art-inclined Chez Panisse staff members to use the restaurant as a means of artistic expression. Their dinners, held at the New Langton Arts Center, focused on themes like dirt (complete with terroir tasting) and urban foraging (make your own salt). Guests are invited to sit on bleachers to observe the spectacle. ‚ÄúThe idea is not to associate food and art but to see the whole restaurant as an art piece,‚Äù says the co-founder Jerome Waag, a performance artist and cook.

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"LOOMIS--Henry. April 19, 1919-November 02, 2008 of Jacksonville, FL. Henry Loomis who, as a young naval officer in Hawaii in World War II taught scores of officers and men of the Pacific Fleet about RADAR, then went on to a long career in government and communications in which he served five presidents. He was 89 and died of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Pick's disease after a lengthy illness. Mr. Loomis, a research scientist, grew up in an ideal environment. He was the youngest of three sons of Ellen Farnsworth and Alfred Loomis, a businessman who made a fortune in New York City before the crash of 1929, lived in Tuxedo Park, where he converted an old mansion into a private research laboratory. Some of the world's best scientist worked on projects there. As a teenager Henry worked with his father on brain wave experiments. Mr. Loomis went to Harvard, where he majored in physics. Convinced in his own mind that the United States would be involved in the war, Mr. Loomis left Harvard in 1940 in his senior year to join the Navy. He graduated first in his naval training class and, because of his background, was assigned to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. He established and ran the RADAR maintenance school, the RADAR operations school and was senior instructor in the RADAR tactical school for senior officers. At the same time, he served as RADAR officer with carriers, air squadrons and battleships. By war's end, he had been awarded a Bronze Star, the Air Medal and the Pacific Ribbon with 13 battle stars. Mr. Loomis left the Navy in 1946 as a lieutenant commander and went to the University of California at Berkeley, where he did graduate work in physics and was an assistant to Dr. Ernest Lawrence, director of the radiation laboratory. There he drafted a report for the university trustees describing the laboratory's nuclear work during the war. After four years as assistant to the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Loomis was called to Washington, where he started a long career in government service. In three successive years, he was a special assistant to the Director of the Research and Development Board of the Secretary of Defense, and served on the staffs of President Truman's Psychological Strategy Board and President Eisenhower's Commission on International Information. Mr. Loomis established and directed the Office of Research and Intelligence at the U.S. Information Agency as Deputy Director and was later named Director of the VOA, a position he held for seven years. In 1959, the VOA broadcast a news program to the rest of the world in English. Mr. Loomis, in survey trips abroad, realized that English was becoming an international language. He wanted to make English easier to understand by VOA's foreign audience, and asked Barry Zorthian, program manager, to devise a way of reaching an audience with a limited knowledge of English. The result was called Special English. Two changes from VOA's standard procedure: the news was delivered at the slow pace of nine lines a minute and the vocabulary was limited to 1,500 words. University critics said it would never work; American embassies abroad demanded the program be taken off the air. With the support of Mr. Loomis, the program stayed on the air and soon hundreds of letters of praise came in to VOA every month from pleased foreign listeners. After a sharp confrontation with President Johnson during the Vietnam War, Mr. Loomis quit as director of the VOA The President had ordered American intervention into Laos and wanted it kept out of the news. Mr. Loomis thought otherwise. In 1972 during the Nixon Administration, Mr. Loomis was appointed president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Critics jumped on the choice because Mr. Loomis had no experience in public television. However, he had built up a reputation as an excellent administrator on earlier assignments, so he weathered the storm and led the CPB for six years. While Mr. Loomis was deeply involved in government assignments from 1950 to 1978, he managed to stay active in his favorite outdoor activities; hunting, sailing, and riding to the hounds with the Middleburg Hunt in Middleburg, Virginia. In his teens, Mr. Loomis and his brother, Lee, built a 35-foot ketch named Lands End, which they sailed on the Atlantic Ocean. Mr. Loomis was a regular participant in the annual wooden boat race off the Down East Shores of Maine at the helm of Lands End. As a hunter Mr. Loomis traveled around the world to countries in South America, Europe and Africa on bird shooting safaris. He shot big game in Kenya. Mr. Loomis served for 13 years with the Mitre Corporation Board, where he was Vice Chairman for five years; the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History; the Museum of Science and History in Jacksonville, Florida, and the Jacksonville Zoological Gardens. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club of Washington DC, the Riverside Rotary of Jacksonville Florida; the Florida Yacht Club; the Timuquana Country Club. Mr. Loomis attended the Riverside Presbyterian Church. Survivors include his wife of 34 years, Jacqueline Chalmers Loomis of Jacksonville, FL; four children, Henry Stimson Loomis (Toni), Mary Paul ''Pixie'' Loomis, Lucy Farnsworth Loomis, Gordon MacLeod Loomis (Patricia); four step-sons, Charles Judson Williams IV, John Chalmers Williams (Peggy Sue), David Finley Williams (Lisa), Robert Wood Williams (Heidi); seventeen grandchildren, Abby, Andrew H., Andrew W., Beky, Elli, Erin, Finley, Henry, Lindy, Lucy, Maggie, Murphy, Nadia, Nathan, Perry (Dean), Sole (Adam), and Zoe; two greatgrandchildren, Ethan and Noah; the mother of his children, Mary Paul MacLeod and numerous nieces and nephews. Memorial service will be held at 11:00am, on Saturday, November 15, 2008 at Riverside Presbyterian Church, located at 849 Park Street, Jacksonville, FL 32204. In lieu of flowers the family suggests memorials to the Jacksonville Zoological Gardens or the Riverside Rotary of Jacksonville, FL. The funeral services are under the care of Hardage-Giddens Blanding Funeral Home, 5753 Blanding Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32244."

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"AT THE PARTAGAS CIGAR FACTORY, HAVANA, OCT. 24, 2008. John G√≥mez, 33, a lawyer from Salamanca, Spain: ''Cuba is a very rich place culturally, but society is completely submissive to the regime and to the rhythm of life that it has established. In the factory, professional artisans work under conditions that we can't even imagine in a developed country. They use archaic tools and yet produce practically perfect cigars in record time. In Havana, the salaries are ridiculous, and there are shortages of everything. To buy shoes for your child is a month's wages. So they've created a parallel subsistence economy to sell cigars, rum, whatever. On any street corner you can find the factory workers or their friends or family, who will take you to their house and sell you these very same cigars, smuggled from the factory. The best phrase I heard to describe it was what a used-book seller told me. 'In this country, everything's for sale. Just ask.' I had a great experience, because it's a beautiful country. I'm leaving ashamed, though, that we don't appreciate things we have, while here they're appreciative for so little.''"

The economic slump and the bailout for the financial industry may reduce the amounts available to cover the uninsured.

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"KENJI AOKI The Japanese photographer Kenji Aoki sees beauty in the everyday. ''It is important to realize that all human products -- tables, photographs or even potato chips -- have an expressive power,'' he says. For ''Exercise in Utility'' on Page 90, Aoki shot an assortment of spectacular furniture designed by contemporary artists. His favorite piece was a surrealist table created by Rosemarie Trockel, complete with faux human legs. ''By turning this table into a work of art, the artist actually brings us back to the basics of design: the initial stick-leg of the table,'' he says. Aoki (whose past work can be seen at center and far right) recently experienced a different form of simplicity at the Eiheiji Temple, a Zen Buddhist center in Fukui, Japan: ''Those monks possesed a mental power I was longing for.'' Aside from forthcoming projects for Western-style deities like Nikon, Cartier and Sony, Aoki's plans include opening his first studio in New York."

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"KAMEN--Samuel E., M.D., August 17, 1912 -November 6, 2008. Loving and devoted husband of Cynthia, father of Margaret and Katherine; stepfather of Jodi and Jonathan; grandfather of Lydia, Charles and Nicholas. After being graduated from CCNY and the prestigious Berlin Medical School, Sam returned to New York in 1938 where he served a residence in Bellevue Hospital, specializing in radiology. He served with distinction as Captain in the Pacific area during World War II. On a beachhead in Okinawa, he witnessed the first Kamikaze raid -on a battleship. His versatility and resourcefulness was obvious, when he created a makeshift viewer on the beach by stringing x-rays of the wounded on a line, reading them with the aid of sunlight. After the war, Sam returned home and got married. The union produced two daughters, Meg and Kathy. Following the death of his first wife, Sam met and married the love of his life, Cynthia in 1954. With her he raised Jonathan and Jodi, ran a successful radiology practice in Brooklyn and headed the Department of Radiology at Sea View Hospital, Staten Island. There he made a significant contribution to the cure of Tuberculosis, then rampant in New York City. Additionally, he was medical director of the Midwood HIP Group in Brooklyn as well as Chief Radiologist of the outpatient VA Clinics in Brooklyn and Queens. Sam was a quiet scholar all his life engaging himself in biomedical research and developments in medical technology. He was an avid fan of Lincoln and his collection boasts a library of Civil war books and memorabilia. He lived a wonderful 96 years, earning the love, respect and admiration of his peers, both social and professional. His generosity of spirit made him a remarkable human being. His deeds and effortless compassion personified grace and goodness as he embraced life in all its aspects. He had the ability to relate to the world in a quiet, unassuming manner. His stature belied the giant he was in character and loving-kindness. After 55 years of a wonderfully happy marriage, his final words to Cynthia, spoken in a loud, clear voice were ''words cannot tell how much I have loved you.'' He showed the greatest of courage as her devoted companion and every effort he made for his family was with great commitment and enthusiasm. Funeral services will be held at the Riverside Gordon Memorial Chapel, 7205 West Atlantic Avenue, Delray Beach, FL 33446 on Sunday November 9 at 2:00pm. Graveside funeral follows at Beth Moses Cemetery, Long Island, NY on Monday November 10 at 2:00pm."

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"As a senator, Mr. Obama supported comprehensive immigration overhaul, and in the campaign he pledged to enhance border security and provide a path to citizenship for millions in the country illegally. And while he said he favored a guest worker program, he also advocated tougher penalties for employing illegal immigrants. But Mr. Obama's proposals are likely to encounter resistance from opponents who contend that they amount to amnesty -- an argument that helped jettison a bill in Congress. And with the economy shedding jobs, opponents will also argue that immigrants are taking jobs from citizens. But experts say Mr. Obama will face pressure to act from the many Hispanic voters who supported his candidacy in part because of his stance on immigration. MICHAEL FALCONE"
2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"Mr. Obama initially raised expectations that he would meet with Iran's leaders; he said during the campaign that the notion of not talking to foes was ''ridiculous.'' Since then, he has tempered his words somewhat, indicating that he would send envoys initially and would meet personally with Iranian leaders only if he thought he could advance the American agenda. Mr. Obama also faces the issue of when to reach out. If he makes a move before June, when Iran's presidential election is scheduled, he risks giving President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claim to a foreign policy victory, to the possible detriment of more moderate Iranian presidential aspirants. But if he waits too long, Iran could get closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon. HELENE COOPER"

Both were daily fans of the New York Times and in Laurence's case, the crossword puzzle! While his wife remained loyal to the paper and pen, Laurence was an enthusiastic early computer hobbyist and one of the first to log on to AOL! He and his son emailed each other daily until shortly before his death! Laurence and Harriet took an active interest in community affairs, their church, and various book groups.

2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,"As voters streamed to the polls, stocks jumped in their strongest Election Day rally in 24 years, with key indexes up more than 3 percent. Behind the News The economy was the driving issue of the election. In exit polls, 6 in 10 voters chose the economy as the most important issue; most of them voted for Barack Obama. Wall Street historically has enjoyed a bounce in the fourth quarter after a presidential election. But some analysts ascribed the rally more to interest rate cuts, a thaw in credit markets and a growing resiliency of the markets to bad news. ''We don't know if it's the end of the bear market yet, but it looks as though the bear has taken a nap,'' said one analyst. So much for the Election Day rally. The bear woke up. Stocks erased all of their gains, with key indexes falling more than 5 percent. Behind the News The selling began early, after a report showed that activity at the nation's service industries contracted in October, falling at the fastest pace since records began in 1997. Several major businesses reported disappointing earnings; there were also concerns about rising unemployment. Still, some analysts said that after weeks of extreme volatility, Wall Street appeared finally to be reacting predictably to bad news. Perhaps a return to stability was at hand. ''Markets are moving in a more orderly way,'' said one analyst."

Mr. Howe was born in Cleveland, OH, on January 21, 1939, to Edwin A. Howe and the former Helen Dorothy Beck. He attended University School, graduated from Yale in 1961, and was awarded an honors degree in law by The University of Michigan Law School in 1964. He also conducted post-graduate studies in law at the London School of Economics. In law school, he was an editor of The University of Michigan Law Review and was awarded the Jason L. Honigman Prize for his accomplishments in that position. He was a member of the Bar of New York State and of the United States Supreme Court. After serving six years at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, Mr. Howe co-founded the international law firm of Sann & Howe (subsequently Howe & Addington LLP) in New York City in 1970, serving it as a Partner through 1989 and then as Senior Partner for ten years until he became Senior Counsel. In 2004, Mr. Howe joined the Ticonderoga law firm Viscardi Howe & Rudgers LLP. Mr. Howe was also a member of The Counselors of Real Estate and the National Real Estate Forum, which he served as chair and then as Executive Director. A source of particular pride to him was his selection as a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Margaret, his three children Christopher, Melissa, and Katie, his son-in-law, Chris Miller, and his two grandchildren, Julia and Beck. Mr. Howe expressed the hope that, if he should end up, spiritually speaking, ''somewhere'' after death, it would be in Ticonderoga and or a place where he could continue to enjoy his memories of Ticonderoga and perhaps even follow the continued activities and progress of its citizens. Anyone wishing to sustain his shade in that endeavor may do so via contribution to Ticonderoga Main Street Partnership, Inc., PO Box 379, Ticonderoga, NY 12883-0379."

2008-11-10T00:00:00Z,"Before the season, with the high hopes of the teams, ESPN must have thought this would be a good Monday night matchup. First-place Arizona has its best record after eight games since 1984, but San Francisco has not held up its end of the deal. The 49ers had a bye week to become more accustomed to Mike Singletary's style and system, so maybe he will not have to send any players to an early shower. Shaun Hill, 2-0 as a starter last season, gets his first start of the season for the 49ers. He is a steady presence with a high completion percentage and few turnovers, but he does not have the downfield skills that the offensive coordinator Mike Martz prefers. Arizona's Kurt Warner does have those skills and displays them best at home, where he has a passer rating of 123. NAILA-JEAN MEYERS"

2008-11-12T00:00:00Z,"It took just one day after the presidential race for the Democratic National Committee to issue a memorandum claiming some credit on behalf of its party chairman, Howard Dean, for the election of Barack Obama. The memorandum asserted that Mr. Obama's sweeping victory was, at least partly, the fruit of Mr. Dean's signature strategy to spend the money to establish a Democratic presence in all 50 states. Mr. Dean's interest in making this argument is understandable. The 50-state strategy was applauded by state party chairmen and chairwomen -- who welcomed the influx of Democratic National Committee money that allowed them to hire staff members in their states, but it was strongly criticized by Democratic Congressional leaders in 2006. With the party poised to make big gains, they wanted Mr. Dean to help finance the hard-fought midterm elections. Mr. Dean refused, engaging in some nasty, public fights with party leaders, who accused him of being stubborn and politically reckless."

''It's essential to keep your dog well groomed, to keep it healthy and happy,'' said Daisy Okas, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit American Kennel Club. The catch is cost. Depending on size and breed, she said, the expense ''could be as low as $25 for a small dog in a rural area, but over $200 for the 'works' -- nails, teeth, ears -- on a large densely coated dog in Manhattan.'' Basic home grooming of pets is a good option for those who want to save money, Ms. Okas said. But it's more than looks: keeping a dog's hair clean, trimmed and brushed reduces risk of infection, she said, and ensures that skin isn't uncomfortably pulled taut by matted fur. Still, people should try not to get carried away, Ms. Okas said. ''A dog is a dog,'' she said. ''They don't need nail polish and perfume, but they do need a decent shampoo and a good brush.''"

2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"LOOMIS--Henry . April 19, 1919-November 02, 2008 of Jacksonville, FL. Henry Loomis who, as a young naval officer in Hawaii in World War II taught scores of officers and men of the Pacific Fleet about RADAR, then went on to a long career in government and communications in which he served five presidents. He was 89 and died of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Pick's disease after a lengthy illness. Mr. Loomis, a research scientist, grew up in an ideal environment. He was the youngest of three sons of Ellen Farnsworth and Alfred Loomis, a businessman who made a fortune in New York City before the crash of 1929, lived in Tuxedo Park, where he converted an old mansion into a private research laboratory. Some of the world's best scientist worked on projects there. As a teenager Henry worked with his father on brain wave experiments. Mr. Loomis went to Harvard, where he majored in physics. Convinced in his own mind that the United States would be involved in the war, Mr. Loomis left Harvard in 1940 in his senior year to join the Navy. He graduated first in his naval training class and, because of his background, was assigned to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. He established and ran the RADAR maintenance school, the RADAR operations school and was senior instructor in the RADAR tactical school for senior officers. At the same time, he served as RADAR officer with carriers, air squadrons and battleships. By war's end, he had been awarded a Bronze Star, the Air Medal and the Pacific Ribbon with 13 battle stars. Mr. Loomis left the Navy in 1946 as a lieutenant commander and went to the University of California at Berkeley, where he did graduate work in physics and was an assistant to Dr. Ernest Lawrence, director of the radiation laboratory. There he drafted a report for the university trustees describing the laboratory's nuclear work during the war. After four years as assistant to the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Loomis was called to Washington, where he started a long career in government service. In three successive years, he was a special assistant to the Director of the Research and Development Board of the Secretary of Defense, and served on the staffs of President Truman's Psychological Strategy Board and President Eisenhower's Commission on International Information. Mr. Loomis established and directed the Office of Research and Intelligence at the U.S. Information Agency as Deputy Director and was later named Director of the VOA, a position he held for seven years. In 1959, the VOA broadcast a news program to the rest of the world in English. Mr. Loomis, in survey trips abroad, realized that English was becoming an international language. He wanted to make English easier to understand by VOA's foreign audience, and asked Barry Zorthian, program manager, to devise a way of reaching an audience with a limited knowledge of English. The result was called Special English. Two changes from VOA's standard procedure: the news was delivered at the slow pace of nine lines a minute and the vocabulary was limited to 1,500 words. University critics said it would never work; American embassies abroad demanded the program be taken off the air. With the support of Mr. Loomis, the program stayed on the air and soon hundreds of letters of praise came in to VOA every month from pleased foreign listeners. After a sharp confrontation with President Johnson during the Vietnam War, Mr. Loomis quit as director of the VOA The President had ordered American intervention into Laos and wanted it kept out of the news. Mr. Loomis thought otherwise. In 1972 during the Nixon Administration, Mr. Loomis was appointed president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Critics jumped on the choice because Mr. Loomis had no experience in public television. However, he had built up a reputation as an excellent administrator on earlier assignments, so he weathered the storm and led the CPB for six years. While Mr. Loomis was deeply involved in government assignments from 1950 to 1978, he managed to stay active in his favorite outdoor activities; hunting, sailing, and riding to the hounds with the Middleburg Hunt in Middleburg, Virginia. In his teens, Mr. Loomis and his brother, Lee, built a 35-foot ketch named Lands End, which they sailed on the Atlantic Ocean. Mr. Loomis was a regular participant in the annual wooden boat race off the Down East Shores of Maine at the helm of Lands End. As a hunter Mr. Loomis traveled around the world to countries in South America, Europe and Africa on bird shooting safaris. He shot big game in Kenya. Mr. Loomis served for 13 years with the Mitre Corporation Board, where he was Vice Chairman for five years; the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History; the Museum of Science and History in Jacksonville, Florida, and the Jacksonville Zoological Gardens. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club of Washington DC, the Riverside Rotary of Jacksonville Florida; the Florida Yacht Club; the Timuquana Country Club. Mr. Loomis attended the Riverside Presbyterian Church. Survivors include his wife of 34 years, Jacqueline Chalmers Loomis of Jacksonville, FL; four children, Henry Stimson Loomis (Toni), Mary Paul ''Pixie'' Loomis, Lucy Farnsworth Loomis, Gordon MacLeod Loomis (Patricia); four step-sons, Charles Judson Williams IV, John Chalmers Williams (Peggy Sue), David Finley Williams (Lisa), Robert Wood Williams (Heidi); seventeen grandchildren, Abby, Andrew H., Andrew W., Beky, Elli, Erin, Finley, Henry, Lindy, Lucy, Maggie, Murphy, Nadia, Nathan, Perry (Dean), Sole (Adam), and Zoe; two greatgrandchildren, Ethan and Noah; the mother of his children, Mary Paul MacLeod and numerous nieces and nephews. Memorial service will be held at 11:00am, on Saturday, November 15, 2008 at Riverside Presbyterian Church, located at 849 Park Street, Jacksonville, FL 32204. In lieu of flowers the family suggests memorials to the Jacksonville Zoological Gardens or the Riverside Rotary of Jacksonville, FL. The funeral services are under the care of Hardage-Giddens Blanding Funeral Home, 5753 Blanding Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32244."
2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Among the art neighborhoods of Manhattan, the Lower East Side is by far the most picturesque. With its dusty synagogues, squeezed-together tenements, anarchist graffiti and shop signs in Yiddish, Spanish and Chinese, it's a visual event whether you're visiting galleries or not. But the essence of a city is change, and this neighborhood is changing. The synagogues and signs are disappearing, along with the anarchist spirit and artist-friendly rents. Chic little bars and boutiques speak of rampant yuppification, although at the moment -- and a sullen economy could prolong this -- old and new are still trading places."

2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,A MATTER Of Principle
2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Your inner dancer is calling. Its voice, sweet but tough and insistent, pulses in every molecule of the new Broadway musical ''Billy Elliot,'' demanding that you wake up sleeping fantasies of slipping on tap or ballet shoes and soaring across a stage. Few people may have the gift of this show's title character, a coal miner's son in northern England who discovers he was born to pirouette. But the seductive, smashingly realized premise of ''Billy Elliot,'' which opened Thursday night at the Imperial Theater, is that everybody has the urge. And in exploring that urge among the population of a down-at-heels coal town suffering through the British miners' strike of the mid-1980s, this show both artfully anatomizes and brazenly exploits the most fundamental and enduring appeal of musicals themselves. It's been more than three years since ''Billy Elliot,'' directed by Stephen Daldry and featuring a score by Elton John, first sent critics and audiences into a mass swoon in London, where it continues to play. The delay in bringing the show to Broadway hinted at fears that it might not sit comfortably on American soil."

Mr. Obama announced Thursday that he would resign his Senate seat on Sunday, thus avoiding any obligation to show up next week and cutting short the odd overlap period when the next head of the executive branch is still a member of the legislative branch. This is the first time in nearly a half-century that a sitting member of Congress has been elected president."

This awards show was determined to present music not as an escape from troubles, but as a way to face them, whether those troubles stemmed from the state of the world or from a broken heart. The show began with the Colombian rocker Juanes, whose album ''La Vida Es un Ratico'' won awards for Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Album. He swept the major awards; his ''Me Enamora'' was named Song of the Year and Record of the Year. He has won multiple Latin Grammy awards for each of his previous three albums."

His delightfully informal manner suggests that he would make a good ambassador for modern dance.

2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"VISITING wine country usually brings to mind sun-dappled hillsides dotted with vineyards, winding country roads and stone chateaus. There are always small towns flush with boutiques and fine restaurants tucked down side roads. Galleries with well-known artists on their walls and symphonies with the latest hot musicians seem to call the area home. That's not what you'll find at JC Cellars or Dashe Cellars, a quick exit off the Interstate near downtown Oakland, Calif. Rows of warehouses line nearby side streets. A restaurant supply store sits on the corner and a gas station advertises cheap hot dogs. If the winery that the two businesses share weren't painted dark red, with their names in gold lettering, you might miss it. Yet it is here among the warehouses and parking lots that young winemakers, like Jeff Cohn of JC Cellars and Michael Dashe of Dashe Cellars, are opening shop."
2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Nearly 20 years after the Salvadoran Army killed six Jesuit priests in one of the most notorious events of El Salvador's civil war, a criminal complaint filed in the Spanish High Court has revived hopes that those behind the massacre could face trial. Human rights lawyers filed a complaint on Thursday against the Salvadoran president at the time, Alfredo Cristiani Burkard, and 14 former members of the Salvadoran military, for their roles in the killings of the priests and two female employees, and in the official cover-up that followed. International outrage over the murders proved to be pivotal in sapping American support for United States military assistance to the Salvadoran Army."

The event was born after Tiger Woods said at the 2007 United States Open that a 10-handicapper could not break 100 on an Open setup. At this year's challenge before the United States Open at Torrey Pines, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo shot an 84; Matt Lauer, the host of ''Today,'' shot 100; and the amateur winner, the Nebraska salesman John Atkinson, shot 114.

But Gus Rancatore, whose Toscanini's shop in Cambridge, Mass., is renowned as much for its deep-thinking clientele as for its sundaes, discovered long ago that catering to the technology-minded crowd could have unforeseen advantages. One day, two M.I.T. students who were ''working in superconductors,'' Mr. Rancatore said, took a good look at his ice cream machine, visible through his shop window, and were ''distressed by the poor engineering.'' So they took it back to their lab and transformed its inefficient gear-drive mechanism into a lean, mean, belt-driven machine. That was 23 years ago. ''We still use the machine,'' Mr. Rancatore said. ''Another generation of M.I.T. engineers just tuned it up this summer.''"

Maybe it is just pulling out the stops during the fall art auctions, when lots of collectors are in town. Whichever it is, this weekend Chelsea provides an ever-humbling, close to encyclopedic survey of ways of making and showing art. It runs the gamut from blue chip to schlock, die-hard hip to clueless, and good to pedestrian to egregious, often within close proximity.

2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"Michael Jordan will participate in the Golf Digest United States Open Challenge at Bethpage Black, to be televised on NBC next June, according to an editor at Golf Digest. Jordan, who has a 1.4 handicap index, will be joined by two celebrities and an amateur who best explains in a six-word essay why he or she can break 100. The event was born after Tiger Woods said at the 2007 United States Open that a 10-handicapper could not break 100 on an Open setup. At this year's challenge before the United States Open at Torrey Pines, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo shot an 84; Matt Lauer, the host of ''Today,'' shot 100; and the amateur winner, the Nebraska salesman John Atkinson, shot 114. Jordan, who will have Fred Couples as a caddie, told Golf Digest: ''Tiger doesn't know anything about me doing this. I don't need his advice -- yet.''"

2008-11-14T00:00:00Z,"AUERBACH--Shay A . Philanthropist, leader in U.S Textiles and the co-founder of The Northwest Company died Tuesday morning at the age of 82. The cause was cancer. Shay Auerbach was born in Brooklyn in 1926, the son of Russian immigrants. Mr. Auerbach graduated from Textile High School and later served in the U.S. Navy Pacific fleet in World War II. After the war he joined his father in the textile industry in the rag business. After many successes, he went on to own and operate various woolen mills in the U.S. In the mid 1960s after recognizing that change would force most mills out of the U.S., Mr. Auerbach entered the men's clothing industry manufacturing men's suits, pants and sweaters and was the first importer of double knit fabrics into the U.S. In the mid 1980s after selling his business and a brief retirement he purchased The Northwest Company with his two sons Glenn and Ross Auerbach. Together with his sons he helped to guide this small business with sales under 1 million dollars into a company with annual sales over 100 million dollars, and the leader in its industry. The Northwest Company is today the largest throw manufacturer in the U.S. and is the decorative home licensee of most of America's finest brands. These brands include the NFL, MLB, Disney, Nickelodeon, and Warner Brothers. The Northwest Company also supports over 100 charitable organizations. Shay Auerbach was a classic Brooklyn boy. Tough: but fair, hard working, loving and caring. A man that was respected by all. Shay Auerbach, devoted husband of the late Florence C. Auerbach, husband of Fran Auerbach, father of Glenn and Ross (Sophia) Auerbach, grandfather of Gabrielle, Daniella, Elex and Alexander, Brother of Henrietta and Sonya and the late Shirley, countless nieces, nephews and cousins. Shay Auerbach saw it all. He watched the world change and he changed with it. And although the world became a very political place, he remained tough and honest. He told you the way it was and everyone knew where they stood with him. He loved life and got to enjoy it as well. They truly do not make men like this anymore. The funeral will take place at 10:00am Friday November 14, at Temple Beth Shalom, 401 Roslyn Rd., Roslyn Heights, NY 11577, 516621-2288. Interment will immediately follow the temple service at Locust Valley Cemetery, Ryefield Rd, Locust Valley, NY 11560, 516-676-5290. Shiva will be held Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at, 24 Fairview Ave., Roslyn, NY 11576, 516625-1219. In Lieu of flowers the family request that donations be made to: The Shay Auerbach Memorial Fund, 49 Bryant Ave, Roslyn, NY 11576."

She inspired many people with her fierce determination and loving spirit. She was proud of achieving a significant medical career despite having a paralyzed arm from a birth injury. Ellen was born and grew up in Brooklyn, the third child of Moe and Pauline (Harber) Scheiner. She was inspired to become a doctor because, during her multiple childhood surgeries and stays at the Hospital of St. Giles the Cripple in New York, she admired her doctors and felt drawn to help other people in the same way. Ellen was also a passionate lifelong activist for civil rights. For instance, in the vanguard of the equal rights movement, she advocated for salary parity for men and women at the hospital. She practiced medicine and then psychotherapy with love for her patients. While at SloanKettering, Ellen started a program to help young doctors communicate more compassionately with their patients. She served as medical liaison with the hospital chaplain service. She also led pioneering work on medical ethics in treating terminally ill patients. Ellen was a longtime meditator and poet. She is survived by her spouse, Rosemary Hyde, her brother, Harvey Scheiner and his wife Phyllis, her sister, Selma Lurie, and their families. Ellen donated her body to the Lineberger Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina, for research on lobular breast cancer. Services were by Walker Funeral Home, Chapel Hill, NC.

Physicians of the Cardiac Institute at Maimonides Medical Center mourn the loss of Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz, a pioneering legend in the annals of cardiac surgery and research. Holder of 23 patents for various medical devices, he had a special interest in the architecture and function of the heart and circulatory system. Dr. Kantrowitz performed America's first human heart transplant and invented the intra-aortic balloon pump, inspiring numerous other breakthroughs in cardiac care. He developed the concept of counterpulsation, a revolutionary means of improving heart function in congestive heart failure patients. His work on artificial hearts, pacemakers and the heart-lung machine was critical in the advancement of open-heart surgery, and his research expanded the knowledge base upon which cardiac care is founded. Dr. Kantrowitz will be remembered with respect and admiration, and we offer our condolences to his loved ones on their loss. Jacob Shani, MD, Chair, Cardiac Institute Edgar Lichstein, MD, Chair, Medicine Joseph Cunningham, MD, Chair, Surgery Stephen Lahey, MD, Director, Cardiothoracic Surgery Maimonides Medical Center KANTROWITZ--Adrian. It is with deep regret that we record the passing of eminent surgeon, teacher and researcher Adrian Kantrowitz. Known most widely as a pioneer in heart transplantation, Dr. Kantrowitz and his contemporaries defined the subspecialty of cardiothoracic surgery. He performed the first human heart transplant in the US in 1967 at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, days after the worlds first in South Africa. Dr. Kantrowitz also advanced the science of neuro-stimulation as an aid to paralysis victims. Among his many contributions to cardiac care, the intra-aortic balloon pump that he developed at Maimonides is perhaps most significant, having saved millions of lives; it continues to be the standard of care for complex cardiac conditions today. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Jean, and the family. Martin D. Payson, Chair, Board of Trustees Pamela S. Brier, President & CEO Maimonides Medical Center"

Two small caveats: Charlene is eight and a half months pregnant; Vernon hates their growing reputation as slow-food artistes. Vernon looks at Charlene. He says, ''Let's leave.'' She nods. Into a satchel they throw two vases, a Hobart mixer, some Mason jars of preserves. They drive away in a borrowed car.

(''Just things,'' Vernon says now with a shrug, ignoring the promises.) Charlene and Vernon met at Chez Panisse, where she was a cook, he a budding wine guru. This was the late '70s, when Alice Waters was remaking American cooking into a cuisine de bonne femme crossed with a Heideggerian reverence for Mother Earth. Charlene and Vernon worshiped Alice but preferred Mother Earth. ''What they were talking about, we were doing,'' Charlene says. ''We actually lived it.'' The couple decamped to Mendocino, planted a garden, opened the New Boonville Hotel, and soon the restaurant had a cult following.

The new album, recorded with the E Street Band, will be the 24th of Mr. Springsteen‚Äôs career, and the fourth to be produced by Brendan O‚ÄôBrien, who also produced Mr. Springsteen‚Äôs recent albums ‚ÄúThe Rising,‚Äù ‚ÄúDevils and Dust,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMagic.‚Äù Among the 12 songs (plus two bonus tracks) included on the album are the title song, which Mr. Springsteen first performed at a ClevelandColumbus, Ohio, rally for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, as well as ‚ÄúThe Wrestler,‚Äù from the Darren Aronofsky movie of the same name.

2008-11-17T12:15:49Z,"The Oregon Ballet Theater has become the latest regional arts company to find itself affected by the tightening economy. The ballet, based in Portland, has announced that to cut costs it will use recorded music instead of a live orchestra at 10 of its 16 performances of ‚ÄúThe Nutcracker‚Äù in December, The Oregonian reported. Donations to the ballet are down 20 percent this year, and nine staff members at the company have taken 5 percent paycuts, while productions cuts have saved about $300,000, or 5 percent of the ballet‚Äôs $6.7 million annual budget. ‚ÄúThis is the stark reality of these times,‚Äù Jon Ulsh, the executive director of the ballet, told The Oregonian."
2008-11-17T18:00:38Z,"As we learned in ‚ÄúBody Heat,‚Äù Kathleen Turner likes her men not too smart, and apparently she appreciates them in drag, too: the actress has joined the cast of Charles Busch‚Äôs coming off-Broadway play ‚ÄúThe Third Story,‚Äù in which Ms. Turner will appear opposite Mr. Busch, who plays the show‚Äôs other female lead. The casting announcement was made by the show‚Äôs producers, MCC Theater. ‚ÄúThe Third Story,‚Äù a satire of gangster movies, science fiction and fairy tales, is written by Mr. Busch and directed by Carl Andress; it will begin preview performances at the Lucille Lortel Theater on Jan. 14 and open on Feb. 2, continuing through Feb. 28.

2008-11-17T16:44:02Z,"Reports of the demise of ‚ÄúLipstick Jungle‚Äù look like they were premature. The NBC drama about well-heeled women in New York, starring Brooke Shields, was shuffled off to Friday nights two weeks ago amid reports that the show was canceled and the remaining finished episodes would not get on air. But as of this week, ‚ÄúLipstick Jungle‚Äù is breathing again. The reason: it showed signs of life on Friday, and it picked up 50 percent more viewers when delayed viewing (from DVRs and other devices) was included in the ratings for the episode broadcast a week earlier. Ben Silverman, the co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said that NBC will now definitely finish the 13 episodes that the network originally ordered ‚Äî it has 4 more episodes to run ‚Äî and may order more if the show ‚Äúgrows more.‚Äù"

(That‚Äôs 14,520 keys, for whoever‚Äôs counting.) The purchase was to be considered by the school‚Äôs board on Tuesday. If approved, the purchase will make Cincinnati an ‚Äúall-Steinway‚Äù school. The idea is partly to help raise the school‚Äôs profile in the conservatory world, where it is not always viewed as in the top rank, said Douglas Knehans, the dean. ‚ÄúIt sends a deep message about our seriousness and credibility,‚Äù he said."

Cleveland has been mired in a round of ‚ÄúAm-not-Are-too!‚Äù since the veteran Jamal Lewis hinted that some players quit in the second half of a loss to the Broncos. Kick returner Joshua Cribbs, one of the few Browns having an excellent year, backed Lewis, but Coach Romeo Crennel was furious. Crennel could use a little less criticism and a little more yardage from Lewis, who does not have a 100-yard game this season. Brady Quinn did everything but win in his first start, producing 30 points, 239 passing yards and 2 touchdowns. Buffalo‚Äôs Trent Edwards has been less impressive lately; he has five interceptions and three fumbles during the Bills‚Äô losing streak. ANDREW DAS."

2008-11-20T00:00:00Z,"IN a few cases, Todd Selby photographed his subjects' work spaces rather than their homes, because these were the places into which they had ''put all their creative output.'' Scott Campbell's Saved Tattoo parlor in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the opposite of the cramped, dimly lighted aesthetic of most ink emporiums. Housed in the 2,000-square-foot ground floor of a warehouse, it has the bright, airy feel of an art-filled loft apartment. Mr. Campbell, 31, lives in a studio apartment a few blocks away that he says has a similar feel on a smaller scale. He used to run a combination tattoo studio and antiques shop nearby, and his love of old things is obvious here. He works on clients in an area furnished with an antique dresser and settee, and he installed subway tile and an old-fashioned sink in the bathroom. For that room's wallpaper, he used rifle targets bought in his native Louisiana; bullet cartridges embedded in a Lucite toilet seat extend the theme. Mr. Campbell said the studio is meant to be welcoming and comfortable -- home-like, in fact --''because obviously getting a tattoo is stressful.''"

2008-11-20T00:00:00Z,"AS nationwide concern grows over childhood obesity and inactivity, fitness products masquerading as toys are being designed to slim and tone the younger segment of the population. In many cases, such items are shrunken, stickered and plastic-encased versions of more mainstream adult apparatus found at gyms or health clubs, such as stationary bikes, treadmills and elliptical trainers. But, as Trina Edwards, a youth fitness expert and registered nurse found, there are a few notable differences to these kid-appropriate, pulse-quickening contraptions -- greater emphasis on safety being one of them. Ms. Edwards, who is the publisher of the online magazine Kids Sports & Fitness, recruited 15 children between the ages of 3 and 7 at the Commonwealth Elementary School in Sugar Land, Tex., to try four exercise products designed specifically for children. She examined workmanship, safety, fitness benefit, and the general level of excitement it generated in the group. Over all, she found that a child's age dictated the success of one product over another and that, in at least one case, the allure of video wasn't as enticing as she had expected.

Well, once you've made that turkey, you need a huge platter to put all the carved meat on. On the low end of the price scale, look to the Martha Stewart Collection at Macy's. The platter, called appropriately enough, Harvest Borders Turkey Platter, is white on white embossed in that traditional English sort of way and at 18-inches it'll fit dark and light meat for the whole family. Williams Sonoma also has a new platter; it features a pair of turkeys that appear to be chatting each other up, or discussing their imminent demise. Coming in at a gigantic 21.5 inches this platter could make a great gift for your mom, or an addition to your own hipster-cool pad (in an ironic kind of way). Finally if you're going for something that you will be able to pass down to your grandchildren and your grandchildren's grandchildren (provided none of them break it) spring the $550 for Mottahedeh's Duke of Gloucester Octagonal platter. It doesn't have a turkey on it, but it has a harvest theme, making it safe for year-round use. The pattern, which was originally made for, you guessed it, the Duke of Gloucester back in 1770, is a true classic you won't regret. Whatever you do, just don't serve your turkey in the pressed tin-foil supermarket roaster you cooked it in."

He takes his time creating installations in broad daylight, makes videos of the process and even uses his real name.

2008-11-22T10:33:20Z,"Re ""The Perilous Intersection of Art and Religion"" (Nov. 9): I appreciate your thoughtful treatment of the controversy regarding the play ""Corpus Christi"" and the broader issues you raise.Many instances have occurred of insults to cultures and religions by a variety of artistic works. I believe that what upsets members of these various cultures or religions is the failure of people in the mainstream media to validate that reasonable people would conclude that an insult had, in fact, occurred.Most people in the United States do not question the right of the artist to free expression. But they do take exception to the denial by the artist and the mainstream media that an insult has occurred.I was particularly bothered by the recent controversy over depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a figure to be ridiculed in the European media. The rationale that ""free speech must be defended"" seemed self-indulgent. Free speech, in general, is really not in danger in Western Europe or the United States. An artist or journalist would have to be comatose not to realize that the public ridicule of the Muslim prophet was guaranteed to result in an angry reaction.Tensions between societies of divergent belief systems, and among segments of a pluralistic society with different belief systems, will never be reduced until respectful treatment of all is achieved.John M. McDonaghCold Spring Harbor, N.Y., Nov. 10, 2008 ‚óèYour column was a good discussion of the tension between art (freedom of speech) and religious sensibilities. I would just add that this tension may always be with us, because the basis of the tension between the two is that a significant aspect of art is the call to reflect and think anew about cherished preconceptions.A significant aspect of the religious sensibility is not about thinking, it is about believing and following. Therefore any contrasting point of view can be experienced as offensive and disrespectful. As far as the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights is concerned, we can rest assured that he does not represent most Catholics, who demonstrate the ability to be sensitive to the need for Catholics to consider alternative viewpoints about their Catholic teachings.These Catholics are informed about how often in history Catholic teachings were an abomination to mankind, for example, the teaching of Jew hatred, the murder of converted Jews and ""witches"" during the Inquisition, the slaughter of innocents during the Crusades, the Concordat with Hitler, the smearing of atheists and competing religionist.Santo J. AlbanoStony Brook, N.Y., Nov. 9, 2008‚óè A turn of phrase you used may create a confusion that you should not have fostered.You write, ""The argument, as it did with 'Corpus Christi' 10 years ago, often gets framed as a First Amendment fight between those championing freedom of speech and those seeking to stifle speech they object to."" While some may improperly frame this as a First Amendment dispute, the First Amendment specifically refers to limitations on speech or the press by Congress (interpreted more generically as government-imposed limitations).What any individual or private group says, or how it may choose to act, in opposing or seeking to stop what it may consider offensive or wrong, whether presented by a theater or written in a newspaper, has nothing to do with the First Amendment.In fact, that very First Amendment equally protects the rights of speakers and writers on both sides of such issues to make as much noise as they want in venting their views, without limitation by any heavy hand of government.Berl BrechnerCroton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Nov. 10, 2008 ‚óè I smirk at the smug definition by the executive editor, Bill Keller, that The Times concedes unto itself, but find that the newspaper even fails on that standard that you and he so happily agree on.Forget all that freedom of the press and religion-gets-no-pass stuff that even we smirkers agree with you on. What about the hypocrisy standard that even the Keller definition should hold you to?Why didn't you deal with Bill Donohue's criticism that The Times would never treat other religions (or secular idols) the way it treated Catholicism in this instance?Would you have dealt with a play in which the Prophet Muhammad was reviled in the same way? Or Moses? Or an equivalent treatment of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a nonreligious context?Maybe you think The Times would have done so. I don't. But at least I would have liked to have seen you and Mr. Keller address the hard contrast and take a public position.Malcolm A. Head, Jr.Milford, Conn., Nov. 11, 2008 ‚óè I was a bit amused by the comment of Bill Keller, the executive editor, whom you quote, in which he states that The Times is ""nondogmatic."" A wit once stated that it's obvious why there is so much tension between The Times and the Catholic Church: ""What can you expect when you have two infallible institutions.""One reason Catholics often feel that The Times is anti-Catholic is the difference in coverage between Catholic sins and the sins of other groups.For example, you had a major story a few months ago about a physician from the teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School who has been accused of sexual abuse. I have seen no follow up, although it sure sounded as if his colleagues in the medical profession acted in a way similar to the way the bishops acted.In the paper of Nov. 13, there is an article about sex abuse in the Orthodox Jewish community on an inside page. But the stories about sex abuse in the Catholic Church seem to be disproportionately on Page 1.Joseph P. ParkesNew York, Nov. 13, 2008The writer is a Jesuit priest.‚óè You write, ""It is tempting for a secular and culturally liberal newsroom like The Times's to dismiss such objections.""Liberal? I am not sure what you mean by that term. Do you mean ""left""? If so, then you are closing in on what The Times is. Personally, I would say, ""very slanted left."" Why? The paper's election coverage would suffice, not to mention its treatment of Senator John McCain and Cindy McCain. The hatchet jobs on those two are staggering reproaches to The Times's editorial pose as a newspaper that attempts to report the news.Did Times reporters simply fabricate the anti-McCain rumors? I can't say they didn't, and The Times has been guilty of publishing its reporters' fabrications in the past.Culturally liberal? The Times has allowed itself to be a propaganda agency for the left. The newspaper long ago abandoned its responsibility to be objective, and has long since forgotten right from wrong.Herb YoodOrleans, Mass., Nov. 9, 2008 ‚óè I consider myself a ""liberal"" Catholic, but just reading the snippets in your column about Terence McNally's play nauseated me.I agree that Bill Donohue is generally over the top, but sometimes he is the only Catholic around who makes a necessary noise. The likes of a Paul Baumann is never heard from as a public voice on Catholic concerns. Liberals tend to be more subtle.Where The Times is concerned, and here we are back to a recent public editor column about bias, journalistic context has a lot to do with it. Bill Keller is disingenuous in his definition of ""liberal,"" that is, with no preconceived value (bias) system that sees all values as equal.Puh-leez. The Times loves gays. It has spared no space to promote gay values and the gay agenda. Do you really think a negative review of ""Corpus Christi,"" one that saw it as trash, would fly? Or that a reviewer might be inclined to consider such a play other than with a certain predisposed bias that fits the newspaper's values?‚óèOn the other hand, The Times loves negative news about the Catholic Church (the pedophile scandal) or even Christianity. Let's be honest. Anyone who reads the paper with an open mind recognizes anti-Catholic bias.One has to ask oneself if ""art,"" however mediocre, trumps our respect for what violates or nauseates others in a human society. Does a somewhat ""artist"" like Mr. McNally working his ""agenda"" trump what others consider sacred? Is not promoting ""Corpus Christi"" as ""art"" merely a way to sabotage readers' values?Dolores D'AgostinoNew York, Nov. 9, 2008 ‚óè Your last paragraph is rich with irony. I don't know of any American daily that covers religion better than The Times, yet that smart, street-savvy religion coverage rarely informs other beats.For instance, it took The Times's political reporters too long to understand what born-again meant during Jimmy Carter's run for the presidency.Similarly, it took too long for that religion savvy to promote a political appreciation of evangelical Christianity or, more recently, to pick up on religiously coded language in George W. Bush's statements.In the same way, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was unknown to the major news media in the lower 48, but she was a hero as governor to anti-abortion and evangelical activists nationally.Most dailies won't cover religion. Take a look at the poverty of membership in the Religion Newswriters Association. I don't mean reporting that a polygamist ranch was raided, but rather, who are the polygamists? What is the latest fight over Jewish conversion? The Times has done this. Most of the other papers haven't, unless they picked up Times wire copy.I reported from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Central America, as well as this country. I've covered religion. Skeptical critters that we reporters and editors are, we are genetically inclined to disregard anything that others take on faith and to downgrade its importance as news. That's wrong, dumb and deadly. I don't have to cite Afrikaners and Dutch Reform Church, ""black hats"" in Israel and settlements, massacres of Copts in Egypt, jihadists of any conviction, 9/11, 7/7 and so on. God(s) help us, even those did not awaken most editors to the continuing importance of religion in public affairs.And I won't even start on nonbelief and its role.Ben L. KaufmanCincinnati, Nov. 9, 2008 ‚óè As a contributor to The Times, I have on more than one occasion been told that a review is not an editorial, and not, I hasten to add, when advancing a political or religious argument.This suggests to me, as does your column criticizing Jason Zinoman's review of ""Corpus Christi,"" a basic failure on the part of The Times to acknowledge that criticism is opinion, and opinion informed by the expertise and experience critics bring to their work.There is no more reason for Mr. Zinoman to credit the Catholic Church's view on the divinity and sexuality of Christ than there is for Paul Krugman to fret that his economic analysis may offend free-market cheerleaders.It is na√Øve to think that critics should not engage with the issues the work before them raises. Given the public posture of the bellicose president of the Catholic League for Relgious and Civil Rights, Bill Donohue, it is even more na√Øve of you to believe he would not have complained had Mr. Zinoman acknowledged why the play is offensive to Catholics.Charles TaylorBrooklyn, Nov. 9, 2008 ‚óè I am pleased to see the executive editor, Bill Keller, acknowledge that The Times is a ""liberal"" newspaper.I also concur with his definition of liberal in the liberal arts sense. I have always read The Times and understand its worldview. I agree with very little in the paper but can read it because it is liberal in orientation and predictable. The Times always endorses the more liberal presidential candidate, and that is O.K.After nearly 30 years, I recently canceled my subscription to The Chicago Tribune. I made it a point to tell it why. The Tribune has always had a certain worldview (center right). It has undergone a reformatting, changed from center right to solid left, and has fired many of the old voices.Why get a solid-left paper when I already read The Times? I read The Wall Street Journal for a solid-right perspective. The Tribune was the center viewpoint. I understood when it endorsed Barack Obama, since he is our senator. It is the rest of the changes that I could not abide.My point is that when newspapers make sudden shifts in worldview, I think it is especially damaging to longtime readers.To The Times: Keep being the liberal lefties you are, and I will keep reading and disagreeing with you. But I will read you. When you reorient a paper after 50 years, it is really irritating and misses the point of the paper. We expect you to represent a certain worldview.Someday, we will come full circle and religion and science will not be hostile.Jim HusseyHawthorn Woods, Ill., Nov. 9, 2008‚óè‚óèRe ""Reading, Writing and Reporters"" (Nov. 16): I read your column about Facebook reporting. This kind of reporting seems to be rather common now. A few months ago I was contacted by a reporter from The New York Post over Facebook. The reporter was writing a story about Anisha Lakhani, the former Dalton School teacher who had written a novel purportedly about her time there. I graduated from Dalton in 1998, and imagine the reporter found me by doing a Facebook search on Dalton graduates.The reporter not only asked if I'd taken a class with Ms. Lakhani (I had not), but also asked if he could borrow some of my old high school yearbooks for the story (I declined).This kind of reporting is certainly not new, and I doubt it will go away.Jason PinterNew York, Nov. 17, 2008 ‚óè Regarding the Cindy McCain part of your column, you write that the reporter Jodi Kantor said that she wanted to contact what you call ""primarily adult sources"" and later quoted her as saying that she wanted to interview ""anyone else"" who had usable information on Mrs. McCain.This indicates to me that she would indeed have used information from minors, had it been available and relevant to her story. Am I wrong or missing something?By the way, did The Times pursue information on Michelle Obama in the same manner as was used to try to obtain information on Mrs. McCain? If the answer is no, then once again bias exists.James M. Van MetreAlexandria, Va., Nov. 16, 2008 ‚óè Thank you for your courage - yes, courage - in writing that it might not have been a good idea for the reporter Jodi Kantor to troll Facebook pages looking for a classmate of Cindy McCain's daughter to comment on Mrs. McCain's parenting skills.Since The Times did it, we out here in America thought it was acceptable. We used to think only pedophiles did things like that.It takes courage to write critically about The Times almost two weeks after the election. Evidently Ms. Kantor is unrepentant about this new tool of investigative journalism, and her editor wishes she had asked his permission first. But you come down somewhat in the middle. Very brave.Gregory TartagliaRye, N.Y., Nov. 17, 2008 ‚óè Your column did not review the methods and standards required for validating comments and interviews from adults.What happens if in a nonscientific selection process, those willing to comment have a biased opinion, either positive or negative? There is great risk when using the reporting techniques mentioned and then referring to the article as news, rather than opinion.Would the reporter have called the individual the article is about and allowed him or her to comment on the other's input and then publish both sides? The readers most likely will remember the initial article, and any future clarifications will either not be printed or be buried somewhere else in the paper.Don TenerowiczEllington, Conn., Nov. 16, 2008‚óèSome of your readers would object if The Times barred journalists from getting the information that readers expect because of the paranoia of a reader who asked whether a reporter ""will be contacting my 12-year-old son, too,"" and that of Richard Stevenson, the Times editor in charge of campaign coverage. Though I understand that the reporter Jodi Kantor's Facebook messages didn't net any sources for her article on Cindy McCain, I'm worried that future work may be harmed by the new guideline from Craig Whitney, the standards editor, that says that approaching minors to ask about private lives requires prior consultation.Putting overrestrictive rules on reporters at the whim of a few overprotective parents doesn't serve the public interest.Nothing short of a McCain endorsement (and probably not even that) would have quieted the critics of The Times who said the paper was in the tank for Barack Obama. If your wrist-slap of Ms. Kantor was an effort to placate the Times-haters, it was a pointless one. Did I detect a whiff of disappointment over the editors' disowning of her Facebook reporting?Ian S.

Among other barrelated activities, she served as the Reporter to the New York State Bar Association Task Force on the Profession from 1994-1995, served as Chair of the Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and was a member of the Departmental Disciplinary Committee for the Appellate Division, First Department from 1990-1996. From 2003 until her death, Mary was the Dean of the School of Law at St. John's University where she was also the John V. Brennan Chair of Law and Ethics. Dean Daly was an honors graduate of Thomas More College and the Fordham University School of Law, where she was a member of the Law Review, and earned an LL.M from New York University School of Law. Although Mary reached the pinnacle of her profession, she remained the selfeffacing and down-to-earth person she was when she joined us at the U.S. Attorney's Office, relying for her success on her unstinting work ethic, humanity, and integrity and never forgetting what was most dear to her, namely her family: her husband Tony Distinti, and their children, Anthony, Stephen and Mary Margaret. DALY--Mary C. Fordham Law School records with profound sorrow the passing of Mary C. Daly, Class of 1972. Mary was an extraordinary member of the Law School faculty for more than twenty years, a brilliant and nationally-recognized legal ethics scholar who made the Stein Institute the preeminent program in the field, a gifted teacher, a superb dean of St. John's Law School, a leading member of our Dean's Planning Council, and a dear friend. Mary was beloved by all, and her warmth, generous spirit, and care for others enriched the lives of everyone she touched. Her life bore eloquent witness to Fordham's motto ''In the service of others.'' We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband Tony Distinti, Class of 1972, and their three children, Anthony, Class of 2007, Stephen, and Meg. William Michael Treanor, Dean"

The piece omits a key fact, however. Mahler writes that ‚Äúthe Democrats have yet to issue a single contempt-of-Congress citation.‚Äù While that may be correct with respect to the U.S. Senate, which appears to be the focus of Mahler‚Äôs discussion, the House of Representatives did approve contempt citations earlier this year for the key White House officials Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten. Further, the House Judiciary Committee has successfully challenged the administration‚Äôs legal claims in federal court, recently winning a landmark ruling from a Bush-appointed federal judge. That matter remains pending on appeal and, like many Congressional efforts to get to the bottom of the Bush administration excesses described in Mahler‚Äôs piece, will continue into the next Congress."

ORMONT--Louis R., Ph.D., 90. For over five decades Lou Ormont was a pioneer in the field of group psychotherapy, as a master teacher and clinician who devoted himself to the art and science of psychoanalytic group treatment. A student of the theater, Lou developed a teaching method, a mix of didactic and experiential learning, that made his public presentations sought after events. To know Lou was to know a quick-witted, dynamic and passionate man who was tireless in his effort to understand people, connecting them to their emotional lives and to one another while navigating through obstacles that divided them. He trained a generation of practitioners around the world, affecting thousands of people daily. Lou taught many to live with immediacy and freedom. He is gone but here. Condolences to his beloved wife Joan, children Dr. Marian Ormont and Dr. Michael Ormont and five grandchildren. Mary V. Sussillo, LCSW Elliot M.

Daly, who was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1975 to 1983. During her tenure at the Office, Mary served as Chief of the Civil Rights Unit, and Deputy Chief and finally Chief of the Civil Division from 1981-1983. In 2004, the Fiske Association awarded Mary the William M. Tendy Public Service Award. Upon leaving the Office, Mary embarked on her distinguished career in academia joining the Fordham Law School faculty where she was the James H. Quinn Professor of Legal Ethics and Co-Director of the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics as well as the Director of the law school's Graduate Program. While a member of the Fordham Law School faculty, Mary was a prolific author and editor publishing multitudinous articles on legal ethics with a concentration on corporate and cross-border practice. Mary's professional involvement extended beyond the law school. She served on several ABA committees and was the Reporter for the ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice from 1998-2000. Among other barrelated activities, she served as the Reporter to the New York State Bar Association Task Force on the Profession from 1994-1995, served as Chair of the Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and was a member of the Departmental Disciplinary Committee for the Appellate Division, First Department from 1990-1996.

Dean Daly was an honors graduate of Thomas More College and the Fordham University School of Law, where she was a member of the Law Review, and earned an LL.M from New York University School of Law. Although Mary reached the pinnacle of her profession, she remained the selfeffacing and down-to-earth person she was when she joined us at the U.S. Attorney's Office, relying for her success on her unstinting work ethic, humanity, and integrity and never forgetting what was most dear to her, namely her family: her husband Tony Distinti, and their children, Anthony, Stephen and Mary Margaret."

''We were on a photography project called Signs of the City. There have been workshops in four cities -- Sofia, Berlin, Barcelona, London. Our task was to take pictures of signs that are unique for Barcelona, in contrast to our own city. We were staying near Las Ramblas: those narrow paved streets, silence, not so many people, really amazing architecture. I love that kind of labyrinth. In Barcelona you can hide if you need some time to be on your own, to listen to some street musician playing the guitar. That's hard to do in Sofia. My friends always make fun of me for traveling so much. Sometimes they joke that I'll soon forget Bulgarian. All the time, I am exploring the way people communicate. Some time ago I thought words were the most important thing. Now I know words are not at all that important. Sometimes I find people who I feel are really close to my heart, and it's not because of the words we have spoken to each other.'' As told to Seth Kugel"

(13, 49) NATURE: THE WOLF THAT CHANGED AMERICA In 1893 Ernest Thompson Seton, right, an animal trapper and naturalist, traveled into the canyons of New Mexico on a mission to kill a wolf called Lobo, the leader of a cattle-killing pack. Known as the King of Currumpaw, Lobo had a mythical ability to cheat death, and after eventually trapping Lobo, Seton found he couldn't kill him. Lobo ultimately died from his injuries, and Seton returned east, recording his findings in the book ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' and using his popularity to push for the creation of national parks and lay the groundwork for the Boy Scouts of America.

At last count, the gloss, which is limited to 500 pieces, had a wait list of 253 people. ''It's an irreverent look,'' said Aaron De Mey, the brand's new artistic director. ''But any woman can wear it.'' He suggests that those looking for just a hint of black should layer it over Lanc√¥me's new (and also limited-edition) Aaron's Red lipstick. The more daring can rub it on their eyelids for a smoky, wet look √† la Marlene Dietrich. As legend has it, the screen goddess used to burn a cork and mix the soot with Vaseline. Today she would probably be No. 254 on that wait list."

2008-11-23T00:00:00Z,"These images of kids playing video games were created by Robbie Cooper, a British photographer who employed a Red camera -- a very-high-resolution video camera -- and then took stills from the footage. Cooper, who says he was inspired by the camera technique that Errol Morris used to interview people in his documentaries, arranged his equipment so that the players were actually looking at a reflection of the game on a small pane of glass. He placed the camera behind the reflection so that it could look directly into their faces as they played. Cooper and his collaborators, Andrew Wiggins and Charly Smith, videotaped children in England and in New York. Cooper, who grew up in Britain and Kenya and played a lot of video games as a child, says he tries to capture ''people interacting with worlds that aren't real.'' In his last major project, which was published in the magazine in 2007, he photographed participants in Internet-based games with their virtual-world avatars. Cooper is particularly struck by the intensity of people's experiences while interacting with digital realms. Drew Hugh, shown above, stares so intently at the screen that he doesn't blink, and his eyes quickly fill with tears, according to his mother. Cooper says, ''It's fascinating that a world that's purely visual can have a physical effect.''"

All leaders are passionate about their beliefs, even the ones you don't like.3. Trust your gut after you have listened, studied and learned from those with a diverse range of opinions.4. You never know who is watching, so work as hard as you can regardless of the assignment.5. Don't stay in your comfort zone too long.6. As my grandmother would say: put yourself in the path of lightning.7. Be flexible because opportunities rarely knock at the most opportune moments.8. Take time to be kind to everyone.9. Focus on your priorities.10. In order to lead, someone must follow.11. Effective leadership depends on your ability to connect and motivate people, not on your title, position or power.12. Set high standards for yourself and your team (lead by example).13. Take the time to develop personal relationships all along the way, and really cultivate those upon whom you depend. In order for them to help you, they must know you. And you must know what will motivate them. Nurture them so they can help you lead. They must believe in not just your ideas, but you.14. Good will matters.15. Women are particularly good at listening and studying their audience.16. Have the courage to make tough decisions.17. When you lead, not everyone will follow, and that's okay.18. You will fail. Don't take your failures or your success too seriously. Learn to laugh at yourself. Trust me. It helps.19. Affiliate yourself with worthy institutions, lead by good people who share your core values.20. You can have it all, just not at the same time, and in the proportions you may want.21. To those who much is given, much is expected."

Trace Adkins's buzzing baritone and Deep South phrasing -- he grew up in Louisiana before moving to Nashville -- make him a stalwart voice of virtue on ''X,'' his 10th album (including two collections). After hits like the leering ''Honky Tonk Badonkadonk'' and the wistful ''You're Gonna Miss This,'' and a stint on ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' (he was runner-up), Mr. Adkins has released his most confident, muscular sounding album. Produced by Frank Rogers, who's also Brad Paisley's producer, ''X'' touches the country bases along with Southern rock and even a piano-and-strings ballad, ''I Can't Outrun You,'' that suggests Bruce Hornsby."

He was a passionate advocate for the Weizmann Institute. A member of the President's Circle and recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Norman also served as Chairman and President of the American Committee, and was Deputy Chairman of the Institute's Board of Governors. Over his nearly 40 years of involvement with the Weizmann Institute, Norman became a pillar of the Weizmann community. He was exceptionally generous with his time, wisdom, and energy, building not only an engaged community of supporters in the U.S., but also facilitating cutting-edge scientific research at the Institute itself. Among his many gifts to the Institute was the Norman D. Cohen Chair in Computer Science; in 2001, the Institute's Jubilee Walk, a tribute to 50 years of excellence, was dedicated in his honor. Norman's legacy at Weizmann will forever be felt, and his spirit lives on through his children, grandchildren, and the many lives he touched. We send heartfelt condolences to Norman's wife, Judith, and the entire family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Lawrence S. Blumberg, Chairman American Committee Pennie Abramson, President American Committee Marshall S. Levin, Exec. V.P. & CEO American Committee Mandy Moross, Chair Weizmann Institute Prof. Daniel Zajfman, President Weizmann Institute COHEN--Norman D. Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York mourns the passing of our member Norman D. Cohen and extends to his family deepest sympathies. Rabbi David M. Posner Marcia Waxman, President COHEN--Norman, co-founder of Lechmere Sales, died on November 24 in New York City. Raised in Dorchester, MA, Mr. Cohen and his two brothers, Maurice and Philip, turned their fathers tire shop in Lechmere Square, Cambridge, into an appliance powerhouse, dominating the retail appliance and TV business in Greater Boston in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Lechmere was one of the first discount stores, known for its merchandise, dominance, knowledgeable sales staff, and its promotions. At a time when weekly sales were unheard of, Lechmere became famous for the 22-cent cherry pies it offered on Washington's birthday; its ''picnic sale'' on the first weekend of Spring, when all its merchandise was moved into the parking lot; and its once-ayear Saturday night ''private sale.'' These events attracted thousands of people to Lechmere stores in Cambridge and Dedham. The Cohen brothers sold Lechmere to Dayton-Hudson Corporation (the predecessor of Target Corporation), but Mr. Cohen continued to work at Lechmere until he retired and moved to New York City. He then devoted himself to the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, serving as President and Chairman of the American Committee and as International Deputy Chairman of Weizmann's Board of Governors. In 1992, the Weizmann Institute awarded him an Honorary Doctorate. Mr. Cohen also served on the board of trustees at the Boston Ballet, the Cardinal Cushing School for Exceptional Children, and Camp Young Judea. He served as a Director of Leonard Silver; Claire Stores, Inc.; and Circuit City, Inc. Mr. Cohen, is survived by his three sons with his first wife, Shirlee (nee Blum): Douglas M. Cohen of Lexington, married to Janine Cohen; Stuart Cohen of Marblehead, married to Anne Lucas and I. Scott Cohen of Framingham, married to Ronna Cohen. He is also survived by his second wife, Judith. (nee Younglieb) and her children, Leslie and Andrew Siben and David Schalit. Mr. Cohen is mourned by his ten grandchildren as well: Jonathan Cohen (with wife Liza Perkins-Cohen); Jeffrey Cohen; James Cohen; Bethany Cohen; Elizabeth Cohen; Caroline Cohen; Stefani Misiph (with husband Joshua); Matthew Cohen; Odile Schalit; and Michael Siben. He has one great-grandson, Aaron Cohen. Norman Cohen was universally loved and respected and will be greatly missed. The funeral will be held at 1pm on Wednesday, November 26, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home: 1076 Madison Avenue, New York. Donations in Norman's honor can be made to the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science, 633 Third Avenue, Floor 20, NY, NY 10017. COHEN--Norman. We lost a very dear and good friend. We will miss him. Patti and Herb Frumkes COHEN--Norman D. The Board of Governors and Members of High Ridge Country Club acknowledge with deep sorrow the passing of our esteemed member, Norman D.

To his wife Judy and to the the entire Cohen family, we wish to extend our sincerest condolences. Phyllis and Joseph Gurwin COHEN--Norman. We lost a very dear and good friend. We will miss him. Patti and Herb Frumkes COHEN--Norman D. The Board of Governors and the Members of Glen Oaks Club express their deepest sorrow at the passing of their esteemed member, Norman and extend their heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Judith and their family. Board of Governors Stuart B. Wilkins President COHEN--Norman Co-founder of Lechmere Sales, died on November 24 in New York City. Raised in Dorchester, MA, Mr. Cohen and his two brothers, Maurice and Philip, turned their fathers tire shop in Lechmere Square, Cambridge, into an appliance powerhouse, dominating the retail appliance and TV business in Greater Boston in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Lechmere was one of the first discount stores, known for its merchandise, dominance, knowledgeable sales staff, and its promotions. At a time when weekly sales were unheard of, Lechmere became famous for the 22-cent cherry pies it offered on Washington's birthday; its ''picnic sale'' on the first weekend of Spring, when all its merchandise was moved into the parking lot; and its once-a-year Saturday night ''private sale.'' These events attracted thousands of people to Lechmere stores in Cambridge and Dedham. The Cohen brothers sold Lechmere to Dayton-Hudson Corporation (the predecessor of Target Corporation), but Mr. Cohen continued to work at Lechmere until he retired and moved to New York City. He then devoted himself to the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, serving as President and Chairman of the American Committee and as International Deputy Chairman of Weizmann's Board of Governors. In 1992, the Weizmann Institute awarded him an Honorary Doctorate. Mr. Cohen also served on the board of trustees at the Boston Ballet, the Cardinal Cushing School for Exceptional Children, and Camp Young Judea. He served as a Director of Leonard Silver; Claire Stores, Inc.; and Circuit City, Inc. Mr. Cohen, is survived by his three sons with his first wife, Shirlee (nee Blum): Douglas M. Cohen of Lexington, married to Janine Cohen; Stuart Cohen of Marblehead, married to Anne Lucas and I. Scott Cohen of Framingham, married to Ronna Cohen. He is also survived by his second wife, Judith. (nee Younglieb) and her children, Leslie and Andrew Siben and David Schalit. Mr. Cohen is mourned by his ten grandchildren as well: Jonathan Cohen (with wife Liza Perkins-Cohen); Jeffrey Cohen; James Cohen; Bethany Cohen; Elizabeth Cohen; Caroline Cohen; Stefani Misiph (with husband Joshua); Matthew Cohen; Odile Schalit; and Michael Siben. He has one great-grandson, Aaron Cohen. Norman Cohen was universally loved and respected and will be greatly missed. The funeral will be held at 1pm on Wednesday, November 26, at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home: 1076 Madison Avenue, New York. Donations in Norman's honor can be made to the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science, 633 Third Avenue, Floor 20, NY, NY 10017. COHEN--Norman D. A dear friend who will be sorely missed. Our sincere condolences to Judith and the entire family. Joan and Herbert COHEN--Norman. A kind, generous and very special human being. Our condolences and love to my dearest friend Judy. Leila Kaycoff and Dr. Sanford Pariser"

2008-11-27T00:00:00Z,"LenDale White did not even take the time to dress after the Titans' first loss before he complained about how he had been used in it, not a good sign for a team hoping to rebound quickly. Coach Jeff Fisher could soothe White's bruised feelings -- he was on the field for only three plays against the Jets -- with a few extra touches against the woeful Lions. Detroit gives up more points (31.5 a game) than any team and ranks last against the run. Its pass defense has been slightly better (19th over all), but why would an opponent -- especially one with the Titans' backfield -- pass when it's so easy to run? The second game of Mismatch Thursday, as Thanksgiving should be known this season, could be a showcase for Tony Romo. He has passed for 539 yards and 4 touchdowns, with two interceptions, in two games since returning from a broken finger, and he said Tuesday that the finger was feeling so good that he thought he could play without the splint that has protected it. That would not be good news for the Seahawks, who rank next to last against the pass and have already surrendered 300-yard games to J. T. O'Sullivan and Donovan McNabb."

The Shubert Foundation has been a fountain of hope and sustenance providing funds for theaters throughout the country with subsidies greater than those of the National Endowment for the Arts.

He either chaired or was a member of the Board of Directors of every major organization involved with the theatre, including The Broadway League and The Broadway Association, among others. He created the Midtown Community Court and spearheaded most initiatives that were beneficial to the health of live theatre.

His wit, wisdom and compassion will be sorely missed by all. New York City has suffered the great loss of a true gentleman.

Along with a simple chrome-framed sofa, she spent a total of $959, plus shipping. Forty-five years later, Arne Jacobsen is known as a master of midcentury modern design, and this furniture looks as good as new. The Egg chairs still spin around effortlessly without squeaking, the sofa hasn't sagged, and the Swan chair's leather hasn't cracked.

2008-11-27T00:00:00Z,"FLEECE fabrics made from recycled plastics have been available for about 15 years. But two years ago, less than 1 percent of the polyester fleece yarn that is a staple of outdoor apparel was recycled. ''Today 20 percent of our yarns are made from recycled materials,'' said Nate Simmons of Polartec, a leading manufacturer of fleece fabrics, based in Lawrence, Mass. Wool is enjoying a renaissance as well. ''Our business has grown an average of 27 percent a year for the last nine years,'' said Keith Anderson of Ibex Outdoor Clothing, a manufacturer of wool apparel based in Woodstock, Vt. Wool has been prized for its warmth and durability for thousands of years, but only in the last decade have manufacturers addressed a major shortcoming: inherent, even maddening itchiness. For now, consumers have to depend on manufacturers' disclosures to know how eco-friendly their outdoor apparel is. But that will likely change soon. ''Leaders in the outdoor apparel industry are working on establishing standards so that apparel can be rated, the way appliances are with the Energy Star label,'' Mr. Simmons said."

Ms. Mawson told Reuters that the document was sent to her by Paul McCartney in 1990, in response to a request for money for the trust. ‚ÄúIt was nine months after I‚Äôd written to him,‚Äù she said, according to Reuters, ‚Äúwhich was part of the mystery because you always think it ended up in the wastepaper basket.‚Äù The name Eleanor Rigby was also discovered on a grave at St. Peter‚Äôs Church in Woolton, Liverpool, near Mr. McCartney‚Äôs birthplace."

In his own search for a property in Florida, Mr. Schwaber has found prices that have dropped 50 percent in the past two to three years.

2008-11-28T00:00:00Z,"HAVING polished off all the historic house tours within a hundred miles of New York City, I've found another way to satisfy my passion for prowling around sturdy and interesting old houses. All it takes is a car, some nerve, and the real estate listings on the Internet. Even as a child growing up in a 1950s split level on Long Island, I had a nose for cheap construction. That house, much as I loved it, gave me a lifelong antipathy toward hollow-core doors, streaky vinyl tiles and Formica. Then, in the '80s, I became immersed in six-over-six windows, decorative plasterwork and marble fireplaces. My husband and I bought a derelict Greek Revival in an iffy Brooklyn neighborhood, and then an 1850s mews house, eventually renovating each of them three times over. More recently, on my own, I've revivified two early 19th-century row houses in Philadelphia."

Friedlander, a member since 1975, counselor from 1987 to 1999, and an Honorary Member of the Grolier Club since 1999. We will sorely miss the friendship, guidance and sage advice of this extraordinary bookman, and our condolences go to his family and his many friends in the world of books. FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut. American Securities is deeply saddened by the death of our former leader, friend and colleague, Helmut N. Friedlaender, who died yesterday in Maine at the age of 95. Helmut was a well-known book collector, investment banker and retired senior financial advisor to the William Rosenwald family. Born on June 17, 1913 in Berlin, Germany, Helmut joined William Rosenwald in 1944. As the Rosenwald interests and activities expanded, he headed an ever - growing organization and served on a number of Boards of Directors of public and private corporations. Helmut was a key factor in the financing of 1407 Broadway, the first skyscraper built in New York City after World War II; the purchase of the Empire State Building from the Raskob estate by the Rosenwald group; and the creation of Western Union International in 1963 under congressional mandate as an independent company. He was for 25 years an active member of the President's Council of the Center for International Studies at NYU Law School. From 1992 to 1996, he served on the Council of the Fellows of the Morgan Library and from 1984 to 1999 on that of the Grolier Club. In 2003, he became a member of the President's Council of the New York Public Library. In November 2005, Reg Carr, President of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, England, conferred the Bodleian Medal on him in recognition of his services to the book world. He was a founding member of the Friends of the Parker Library (Cambridge, England) in 2004. An active member of Congregation Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Helmut was a director of the AMETEK and Gumpel - Lury Foundations and President of the Eugen Friedlaender Foundation. For more that 50 years, Helmut served as Director of AMETEK, Inc., a New York Stock Exchange listed company, and was named a director emeritus after he stepped down from the board. He served as the first eastern director of the Union Stockyards of Omaha in their then 120year history and was also a director of numerous other companies. Helmut, his father, mother and sister left Germany within two months of Hitler's rise to power. Educated in Germany and Switzerland, where he obtained a Doctor of Law degree from Lausanne University, Helmut learned international arbitrage in London, England. On arrival in New York in 1936, he joined Abraham & Co. as Continental aribitageur. During World War II, he was a writer and announcer for NBC (the Voice of America). In 1944, Helmut became a U.S. citizen, joined the William Rosenwald family, and also married Ernestine Fried, a native New Yorker and longtime President of the Women's City Club of New York. She died in 1982. American Securities sends heartfelt condolences to Helmut's two daughters, Dr. Jane Lury of New York, and Judith G. Friedlaender and her husband, Yosi Yaari, and a granddaughter, Catherine Ann Friedlaender. Services will be held on Monday, December 1 at 11:45am at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street, New York City. >FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. died age 95 on November 25. Born in Berlin, he left Germany 2 months after Hitler rose to power in 1933. After completing a Doctorate of Law at the University of Lausanne, he learned international arbitrage in London and then began his career as a financier at Abraham & Co in New York. In 1944 he became Financial Advisor to William Rosenwald. He was instrumental in a range of transactions which helped to shape New York City: the financing of 1407 Broadway, the first skyscraper built in NY after WWII, the purchase of the Empire State Building by the Rosenwald group and the creation of Western Union International. He served as a Director and then Director Emeritus of AMETEK for over 50 years as well as, at various times, a director of the Union Stockyards of Omaha, Aeolian, American Banner Lines, Cherry-Burrell, Haveg Industries, Mangood and others. His traditional European education, which included 8 years of Greek and 10 years of Latin, led him to many avocations. For 25 years he served as a member of the President's Council of the NYU School of Law Center for International Studies. In 1970, he began collecting rare books, amassing a significant collection which was sold at auction at Christies in 1992. Almost immediately after the sale, he began collecting again, taking great pleasure in buying back some of his favorites at vastly lower prices, as he had managed to sell at the top of the market. Over the years, he served on the Council of Fellows of the Morgan Library, was elected an Honorary Member (one of 47 in its 124 year history) of the Grolier Club. In 2005, he was awarded the Bodleian Medal by the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, England, in recognition of his services to the book world. He was an active member of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mr. Friedlaender was married to Ernestine nee Fried from 1944 until her death in 1982. He is survived by his daughters Jane Lury of New York City, Judith Friedlaender of Yarmouth, Maine and Harpsden, England, and by his granddaughter Catherine Friedlaender of Salvador, Brazil. The funeral will be at Riverside Funeral Chapel in New York City on Monday, December 1st at 11:45. Burial will be private. Contributions may be made in his memory to the Eugen Friedlaender Foundation, Suite 1501, 60 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10165. FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. The Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc. expresses their deepest sorrow at the passing of their esteemed colleague and friend, Helmut, and offers their heartfelt sympathy to his family. Hal was an individual of unquestioned character and integrity. He served as a Director of AMETEK for more than 50 years, and, while his business achievements were impressive, his personal stature is best measured by his public spiritedness and generosity. Hal long and actively supported a wide range of public and private causes. Hal's long association with AMETEK began in 1955, when he was elected to the Board of Directors. Since then, his contributions to AMETEK have been innumerable. Five AMETEK Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers have benefited from his wisdom and counsel during his five decades on its board. His understanding of the business and financial worlds has been an invaluable asset to the Company and its shareholders. Indeed, in its nearly 80-year history, there probably has not been a single individual who has had a greater, or more positive, impact on AMETEK than Hal Friedlaender."

The Shubert Foundation has been a fountain of hope and sustenance providing funds for theaters throughout the country with subsidies greater than those of the National Endowment for the Arts.

He was an adjunct professor, teaching Friday afternoons for almost 30 years, and influenced a legion of theatre producers, managers, directors, dramaturgs and playwrights who are currently making theatre in New York City, across the country and around the world. No matter how busy he was, he always found time for his students, past and present, and he took great pleasure in their success. Friday afternoons will never be the same. We will all miss him greatly. Steven Chaikelson, Chair, Theatre Program; Carol Becker, Dean, School of the Arts SCHOENFELD--Gerald.

The risk is that Indian nationalists, such as the hot-headed chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, use the Mumbai attacks to gain ground and be more confrontational toward Pakistan. That in turn would empower Pakistani nationalists and radicals, and we would see more terror attacks in Pakistan and India alike.

And Jenkins has been huge, but the D has not improved that much. It is clear to anyone with an open mind that Favre has made a huge improvement in this team and no way would Pennington have them 8-3.

I don't think that traveling is a 'healing' process; if you are grieving, you first have to come to terms with it, which takes time and rest. Only then can you open yourself to new impressions and start enjoying things again. Grief is like a wound, and you don't normally go on a holiday with a wound. But after a hard period of grief, I have come to enjoy life again. This photograph is from my holiday this summer, which was a combination of walking and enjoying Swiss trains with a group of 10 people. On the train you can hang out of the window, see all the bends come and go, and you're daydreaming happily like a child. I was pleasantly musing, enjoying the peace and beauty, and again and again I was astonished. To quote a Dutch author: 'When you are traveling, you live double,' and this is just my own experience too. You are happy, enjoying yourself, living more intensely and freely.'' As told to J. R.

Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney, Metropolitan, Art Institute of Chicago, the Victoria and Albert Museum (London), the Biblioteque Nationale (Paris) and many other public and private collections worldwide. Ms. Hoff was born (1910) and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a six-year-old she modeled small figures from the clay the well-drillers left behind. At 14 she won a silver medal in ""Free Hand Drawing."" After two years at the University of Tulsa, she relocated to Chicago to pursue the study of art. She first found success with her edgy, figurative work while still a student at the Art Institute of Chicago in the mid-1940s; a one-man show at the Wildenstein Galleries in Paris (1955) brought international recognition. She moved permanently to NYC in 1960, where her more abstract collage paintings attracted immediate institutional and critical attention; ""The Crowd"" (1960), a 40"" x 30"" paper collage and acrylic on canvas, was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art that same year. She would later exhibit with Betty Parsons. As artist-in residence she taught at numerous American universities as well as in China, Brazil, Lebanon and Uganda. She is survived by a daughter, Mia, of Edinburgh, Scotland. A memorial service is pending. (More information about Margo Hoff's life and career is available at MargoHoff.com.)"

McKELVEY--Andrew J., loving father, generous friend, philanthropist, entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of Monster Worldwide, died November 27, 2008 after a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan. In 1967, using borrowed office space and a part time assistant, Andy started Telephone Marketing Programs, which grew to capture 30% of the United States national yellow pages advertising business. In the early 1990s, TMP expanded into newspaper help wanted advertising and in 1995, TMP acquired The Monster Board, the world's 454th website which became Monster.com. Andy believed that if you make money in this country, you have an obligation to give it back. His success enabled him to support and fund several charitable endeavors. The McKelvey Foundation has thus far supported over 600 students to attend college. Since 2001, he has generously funded the Andrew J. McKelvey Lung Transplant Center at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. He has also provided funds for the Andrew J. McKelvey Lower School at the Hewitt School in Manhattan. In addition, he provided funding for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America and for the Andrew J. McKelvey Campus Center at Westminster College in PA, his alma mater. Andy worked with our nations elected officials on initiatives such as Americans for Gun Safety and the 9/11 educational fund, Families for Freedom. Andy was equally passionate, disciplined and determined in business and in his personal life. He was a lifelong entrepreneur, starting his first business at age 11. He lived by his own rules and believed that ''timing is everything.'' He was humble, trusting, generous, curious and driven. He was also an adventurer who traveled to every continent, often organizing exotic trips with all of his closest friends and family. Andy will be greatly missed and is loved by his four children: Geoffrey, Stuart, Christine, Amanda as well as his six grandchildren: Zachery, Dylan, Gray, Andrew, Siena and Alex. A memorial service will be announced. In lieu of flowers, please send donations in to either of the following charities, which he was very passionate about. McKelvey Foundation, 200 Park Ave., 44 Floor, New York, NY 10166. The McKelvey Center at Emory University, 1364 Clifton Road, NE, Room F-520, Atlanta, GA 30322."

2008-11-30T00:00:00Z,"Nobuyoshi Araki and Sawa Suzuki make a splendid pair. He is one of Japan's most infamous art photographers, known for his vision of erotica -- sexy, color-saturated close-ups of flowers, overripe fruit and overripe geishas, not to mention nubile young wom en tied up into explicit knots. She, on the other hand, is notorious for her roles in Japanese films like ''New Love in Tokyo'' (she plays a girl who is both amateur actress and professional dominatrix), ''Watch Me'' and ''Karaoke Terror.'' (It should come as no shock that Quentin Tarantino is a fan of her work.) Here, Araki and Suzuki come together to play out their own rendition of ''Belle de Jour,'' Luis Bu√±uel's 1967 cult classic. Suzuki steps into a specially selected fall wardrobe and Catherine Deneuve's legendary shoes as S√©verine Serizy, a sexually repressed housewife who finds an outlet from her stultifying bourgeois marriage in a day job as a high-class call girl. Fashionwise, it's certainly the right moment -- rife with ladylike dresses and skirt suits in a conservative palette of black, beige, gray and white, undercut by subtly kinky details like a keyhole back, a touch of plumage or lace, even the occasional bondage strap."

A man with an unparalleled joie de vivre, with an elegant exterior that clothed a tender and loving heart. A devoted and loyal friend. Accomplished and brilliant, but never an elitist, Hal knew that the good of one is linked with the good of all. His ability to love people, the world, and life itself continues to inspire all of us whose lives he touched. Nora Lavori, Liana and Alex Sterling FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. died age 95 on November 25. Born in Berlin, he left Germany 2 months after Hitler rose to power in 1933. After completing a Doctorate of Law at the University of Lausanne, he learned international arbitrage in London and then began his career as a financier at Abraham & Co in New York. In 1944 he became Financial Advisor to William Rosenwald. He was instrumental in a range of transactions which helped to shape New York City: the financing of 1407 Broadway, the first skyscraper built in NY after WWII, the purchase of the Empire State Building by the Rosenwald group and the creation of Western Union International. He served as a Director and then Director Emeritus of AMETEK for over 50 years as well as, at various times, a director of the Union Stockyards of Omaha, Aeolian, American Banner Lines, Cherry-Burrell, Haveg Industries, Mangood and others. His traditional European education, which included 8 years of Greek and 10 years of Latin, led him to many avocations. For 25 years he served as a member of the President's Council of the NYU School of Law Center for International Studies. In 1970, he began collecting rare books, amassing a significant collection which was sold at auction at Christies in . 2001. Almost immediately after the sale, he began collecting again, taking great pleasure in buying back some of his favorites at vastly lower prices, as he had managed to sell at the top of the market. Over the years, he served on the Council of Fellows of the Morgan Library, was elected an Honorary Member (one of 47 in its 124 year history) of the Grolier Club. In 2005, he was awarded the Bodleian Medal by the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, England, in recognition of his services to the book world.

As the Rosenwald interests and activities expanded, he headed an ever - growing organization and served on a number of Boards of Directors of public and private corporations. Helmut was a key factor in the financing of 1407 Broadway, the first skyscraper built in New York City after World War II; the purchase of the Empire State Building from the Raskob estate by the Rosenwald group; and the creation of Western Union International in 1963 under congressional mandate as an independent company. He was for 25 years an active member of the President's Council of the Center for International Studies at NYU Law School. From 1992 to 1996, he served on the Council of the Fellows of the Morgan Library and from 1984 to 1999 on that of the Grolier Club. In 2003, he became a member of the President's Council of the New York Public Library. In November 2005, Reg Carr, President of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, England, conferred the Bodleian Medal on him in recognition of his services to the book world. He was a founding member of the Friends of the Parker Library (Cambridge, England) in 2004. An active member of Congregation Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Helmut was a director of the AMETEK and Gumpel - Lury Foundations and President of the Eugen Friedlaender Foundation. For more that 50 years, Helmut served as Director of AMETEK, Inc., a New York Stock Exchange listed company, and was named a director emeritus after he stepped down from the board. He served as the first eastern director of the Union Stockyards of Omaha in their then 120year history and was also a director of numerous other companies. Helmut, his father, mother and sister left Germany within two months of Hitler's rise to power. Educated in Germany and Switzerland, where he obtained a Doctor of Law degree from Lausanne University, Helmut learned international arbitrage in London, England. On arrival in New York in 1936, he joined Abraham & Co. as Continental aribitageur. During World War II, he was a writer and announcer for NBC (the Voice of America). In 1944, Helmut became a U.S. citizen, joined the William Rosenwald family, and also married Ernestine Fried, a native New Yorker and longtime President of the Women's City Club of New York.

Tony Award nominated Broadway star, Patricia Marand, who graced the stage opposite such theatre greats as Yul Brynner, Alfred Drake, Jack Cassidy and Dan Dailey, passed away on November 27th, due to brain cancer.

A statuesque, red haired beauty with an unforgettable rich and melodic soprano voice, Marand's performances epitomized Broadway theatre with memorable grace and style. Marand began her career in the hey-days of Broadway playing leading roles in ''Wish You Were Here,'' ''Kiss Me Kate,'' ''Pajama Game,'' ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Oklahoma,'' ''Man of La Mancha,'' ''Kismet'' and ''South Pacific,'' to name a few. While the Broadway stage was her true home, Marand's voice enchanted thousands in acclaimed concert solos with the Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New Haven and Minneapolis symphony orchestras, as well as during engagements at the Cotillion Room at New York's Hotel Pierre and La Maisonette at the St. Regis. She frequently appeared on television on the Merv Griffin, Johnny Carson and Ed Sullivan shows. She also appeared recently on the small screen as Helen Barone in ''The Sopranos.''

2008-11-30T00:00:00Z,"HOFF--Margo. Modernist artist Margo Hoff died Sunday, August 17th, in the Spartan, Manhattan loft which served as both her painting studio and home. She was 98 years old. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney, Metropolitan, Art Institute of Chicago, the Victoria and Albert Museum (London), the Biblioteque Nationale (Paris) and many other public and private collections worldwide. Ms. Hoff was born (1910) and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a six-year-old she modeled small figures from the clay the well-drillers left behind. At 14 she won a silver medal in ""Free Hand Drawing."" After two years at the University of Tulsa, she relocated to Chicago to pursue the study of art. She first found success with her edgy, figurative work while still a student at the Art Institute of Chicago in the mid-1940s; a one-man show at the Wildenstein Galleries in Paris (1955) brought international recognition. She moved permanently to NYC in 1960, where her more abstract collage paintings attracted immediate institutional and critical attention; ""The Crowd"" (1960), a 40"" x 30"" paper collage and acrylic on canvas, was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art that same year. She would later exhibit with Betty Parsons. As artist-in residence she taught at numerous American universities as well as in China, Brazil, Lebanon and Uganda. She is survived by a daughter, Mia, of Edinburgh, Scotland. A memorial service is pending. (More information about Margo Hoff's life and career is available at MargoHoff.com.)"
2008-11-30T00:00:00Z,"ROLL--Irwin C. ''Win'', The head of several New York advertising agencies bearing his name, who first conceived the marketing potential for the 800 number in 1965, and launched the first nationwide information utility accessible through a single toll-free call from anywhere, any time, died November 20 at his home in Henderson, Nevada. He was 83. The cause was complications of Parkinson's Disease. Win Roll was a beloved and influential figure in the many lives he touched during his long life. He liked to say he entered advertising because it combined his love of words, music, art, and ideas. After serving in Europe during World War II, he graduated first in the Advertising class at City College. At Fuller & Smith & Ross (FSR), a major midtown agency during the golden years of New York advertising agencies, he headed up accounts including Time Incorporated, Raytheon, and Air France. In 1965 he decided to buy into a smaller but well established ad agency which became Henderson & Roll serving clients including Union Camp, Standard Packaging, Morgan Guaranty Bank, Diamond International, and Republic National Bank of New York. Mr. Roll then created the innovation that literally changed the world. He launched Listfax Corporation in 1966, pioneering the concept of the toll-free number together with 24/7/365 instant information retrieval, any time day or night, which enabled advertisers to connect prospects instantly to more information or their nearest local dealer. An understated man with a self-effacing modesty, Mr. Roll had the audacity, both intellectually and emotionally, to believe things were possible that had never been done before. His revolutionary concept, now ubiquitous, presaged the advent of the information age and the internet. Shuttling between his home in White Plains, the ad agency in New York, and the Listfax operations center in Norwalk, CT, he took Listfax public the same year, earning industry kudos. It was featured in Time Magazine as one of the 5 fastest starting stocks of 1966. An avid theatre goer with his late wife Marilyn, and a tennis and piano playing enthusiast, Mr. Roll devoted much time to community service leadership, as President of Beta Gamma Sigma, the national business honor society; President of AdNet, an advertising industry volunteer service organization; and the Boards of Kol Ami Synagogue in White Plains, NY, and the P.R. Board of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Mr. Roll's wife Marilyn, to whom he was devoted for 58 years, died in 2006. He is survived by two sons, Richard Roll, of Fairfield, CT, and Douglas Roll, of Henderson, NV, two sisters, Constance Grace and Joyce Scheer, daughter - in - law Christine, and two loving granddaughters, Allison and Rebecca Roll. Donations may be made to the Parkinson's Foundation, and the National M.S. Society."

He was born in Washington, D.C., on August 7, 1917, the son of Otto E. Koegel and Rae F. Koegel. His formative years were in Wilmette, IL, and Bronxville, NY. He attended Culver Military Academy and Bronxville High School and graduated from Williams College in the Class of 1939 and Fordham Law School 1942. He served in the Army in World War II and upon his discharge began the practice of law with Dwight, Harris, Koegel & Caskey in Manhattan. As an associate and partner he served in the corporate department of the firm until 1976 when he retired. The firm was then Rogers & Wells and is now Clifford Chance. In 1946 he married Christina N. Williams. She survives him as do his children, Christina K. Granrud of Kalispell, MT, Sarah N. Koegel of Armonk and James A. Koegel of Bedford, NY, as well as grandchildren, Phillip and Jennifer Granrud. He is also survived by sister, Ruth K. Macreery of Redding, CT and a brother, William Koegel of Somers, NY. For 27 years he had a home in Granite Springs, NY, on the large farm owned by the family for almost fifty years. He was a superb horseman and rode in many hunter and jumper classes in horse shows throughout Westchester. He continued to ride into his eighties. In Somers he was active in civic affairs and in development. He was Justice of the Peace from 1947 to 1962 and served as President of the Westchester County Magistrates Association. He also served as Chairman of the Red Cross drive for Somers/North Salem, as Chairman of the Westchester County Committee on Youth Services and Vice President of the United Way of Northern Westchester. He also developed a number of properties in Somers including West Somers Park in Granite Springs. He was an avid golfer and his Armonk home bordered the 15th green of the Whippoorwill Country Club to which he belonged. Jim was devoted to his family, his horses and golf, in that order, and he will be sorely missed. The service for him and the interment will be private."

The Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc. expresses their deepest sorrow at the passing of their esteemed colleague and friend, Helmut, and offers their heartfelt sympathy to his family. Hal was an individual of unquestioned character and integrity. He served as a Director of AMETEK for more than 50 years, and, while his business achievements were impressive, his personal stature is best measured by his public spiritedness and generosity. Hal long and actively supported a wide range of public and private causes. Hal's long association with AMETEK began in 1955, when he was elected to the Board of Directors. Since then, his contributions to AMETEK have been innumerable. Five AMETEK Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers have benefited from his wisdom and counsel during his five decades on its board. His understanding of the business and financial worlds has been an invaluable asset to the Company and its shareholders. Indeed, in its nearly 80-year history, there probably has not been a single individual who has had a greater, or more positive, impact on AMETEK than Hal Friedlaender. FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. The family of William and Mary Rosenwald deeply mourn the passing of Helmut N. (Hal) Friedlaender, our partner and advisor, an extraordinary investor and a great man, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. From 1944 through the next 40 years, Hal brilliantly guided the family's investments and investment bank, then known as American Securities Corporation. Hal's goal was to create opportunities with a defined limited risk and an unlimited potential, building such businesses as Western Union International and AMETEK, Inc. We celebrate Hal for his integrity, his values, and his enjoyment of life. We are forever grateful for his visionary guidance and his deep friendship. He continues to inspire us.

2008-12-01T00:00:00Z,"This game lacks playoff implications, but it will provide a national audience for two underrated Texans: the rookie running back Steve Slaton (774 yards) and receiver Andre Johnson (81 catches, 1,071 yards).

(Jack Pardee had been fired a week earlier.) The Jaguars' descent from an 11-5 playoff team to a struggling also-ran has been swift, but it can probably be traced to the crumbling of its offensive line. Jacksonville lost its starting guards to season-ending injuries in Week 1 and played without center Brad Meester for the first six games. While the Jaguars have searched for solutions, David Garrard has been sacked 30 times and Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor have failed to gain 1,000 yards between them. ANDREW DAS"

Founded by his father William (Dutch) Nolan in 1920, it was the first children's glove company in the US. He served as President from 1960 to 1999. It was his tremendous dedication and hard work that sustained the company successfully into the fourth generation of Nolan's. His reputation in business as a man of honor remains a legend to this day. He loyally served in the Army Air Force in England, during WWII, providing air traffic control and radio support of the battles of Ardennes and Normandy. He was one of the first American soldiers to track and report the arrival of the V-1 missiles launched by Germany over the English Channel in 1944. Edward was a man of exceptional grace and a courtly gentleman at all times and in all situations. The twinkle in his blue eyes charmed the world and kept it warm. He was married and deeply devoted to his wife of 53 years, Alice Joan Stouges, who predeceased him in 2002.

2008-12-02T00:00:00Z,"BERRY--Eliot Ward, died of heart failure on November 29, 2008, age 59. Beloved father of Christopher, son of Nancy and Rynn Berry, and brother of Charles, Peter and Rynn, Jr. Eliot graduated from Buckley, Choate, the University of Pennsylvania (BA '71) and King's College, London University (Ph.D.) and received a Fulbright at Kassel University in Germany. He was a superb natural athlete and insightful and elegant writer. Author of Tough Draw, regarded by Arthur Ashe and Herbert Warren Wind as one of the best books ever on the game of tennis and the psychology of competition, Eliot brought to his craft a novelist's eye and ear, a scholar's encyclopedic knowledge and joy of literature, and an accomplished competitive athlete's awareness of the exhilaration and lonely struggles of athletic competition at the highest levels. He was inducted into the University of Pennsylvania Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000 in recognition of his achievements in football, squash and tennis. He was All-Ivy in all three sports. As a place kicker, he was signed to both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Atlanta Falcons; a gifted tennis player from a young age, he won the New York State 16s, was third-ranked in the East and played on the 1970 ECAC Championship Team; and in squash he played on the international tour, was number one for the U.S. Team at the World Championships in 1977 and won the Metropolitan Squash Singles Championship in 198082. Eliot's other published works included a novel, literary criticism and Topspin, another acclaimed book on the professional tennis tour. At the time of his death Eliot had recently completed an authorized screenplay of Albert Camus's iconic The Stranger. He was founder and principal of Eliot W. Berry & Co., real estate appraisers. A memorial service will be held at St. James' Church, Madison Avenue and 71st Street, Friday, December 5, at 12 noon. Contributions may be made to the Al Molloy Squash Fund at the University of Pennsylvania's Weightman Fund."

2008-12-02T00:00:00Z,"ABELES--Joseph. The Division of Rheumatology at the NYU School of Medicine expresses deep sorrow on the loss of Joseph Abeles. Joseph Abeles will be remembered as a warm and loving person, always proud of his wife Sophia and devoted family. He made everyone joyous whenever in his presence. We offer sincere sympathy and condolences to the entire family. Steven Abramson, M.D., Director of the Division of Rheumatology at NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases ABELES--Joseph Charles, died peacefully in his Pleasantville home on November 30, 2008 at age 93. Joe is survived by his sister, Helen Levanthal, his daughters Lucille Werlinich and Barbara Abeles, his grandson, Greg Werlinich, and his three great - grandchildren, Nola, Lily and Ezra. Joe was born in New York City on January 6, 1915 and lived his entire life in the New York area. He was a devoted husband for over 60 years to his beloved Sophia who passed away in 2001. Joe will be remembered for many things: his love for his family, his business acumen and his investment prowess; his love of golf, Johnnie Walker scotch, and along with Sophia, an abiding belief in philanthropy. After completing high school at age 15, Joe earned a B.S. in chemical engineering from NYU. He then worked briefly for Parker-Kalon as an industrial engineer. In 1936 he joined Faesy & Besthoff as a sales agent. In 1950 he co-founded the Kawecki Chemical Company. In 1968 KCC joined with the Beryllium Corporation to form Kawecki Berylco Industries, or KBI. For 28 years he led the company through domestic and international growth, culminating in the sale of the company to the Cabot Corporation in 1978. KBI then employed over 2,000 people and had sales in excess of $200 million. After retiring from Cabot in 1980, Joe spent the better part of the next 25 years focused on the stock market, making private equity investments, and helping to guide a number of small companies through his position on their Boards of Directors. Some of those companies included Ultralife Batteries, a company he helped to co-found, Intermagnetics General, Bluegreen and Igene Biotechnology. Outside of his family, work and the stock market, Joe's greatest passion was golf. He took his clubs with him wherever he traveled in the world. Some of the great life lessons that he imparted to family, friends and colleagues were that: ''fast payers make good friends'', ''it's better to one putt than three'', and of course, ''drive for show but putt for dough''. Then after the round, it would be time for a Johnnie Walker Black, on the rocks, with a twist. Joe and Sophia established the Joseph and Sophia Abeles Foundation 39 years ago. They used this charitable foundation to support their numerous philanthropic activities. They supported local causes important to them, principally education, the arts and medicine. They tried to give their money to causes where they could do the most good and have the greatest impact. The greatest examples of their work can be seen at Westchester Community College where they have endowed more than two dozen teaching chairs and where they set up the Nancy Jo Abeles Scholarship Fund, in memory of their daughter Nancy, to create opportunities for people who may not otherwise have been able to receive an education. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people around the world who have received, and likely still have, a pocket diary and/or a penlight given by Joe. There are at least as many people who have shared a round of golf, discussed the stock market, or simply been given some simple words of wisdom by Joe. He was an honest, loyal and generous man. He will be missed by all who knew him. Contributions can be made in his name to the Nancy Jo Abeles Scholarship Fund through the Westchester Community College Foundation, 75 Grasslands Rd., Valhalla, NY 10595. 914-606-6670. A service will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 21 Broad St., Mt. Vernon, on Wednesday, December 3, at 12:00. The family will greet friends at the home, 1055 Bedford Rd., Pleasantville, NY, after the service, and again from 4:00 to 7:00 on Thursday."
