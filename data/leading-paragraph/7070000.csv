Rodin's ''Eve, the Large Version,'' sold for a record $18.9 million; the expected price was $9 million to $12 million.

A wonderful oddity of summer theater -- especially at Shakespeare festivals -- is that in prime vacation months and often under sunny skies we gather to witness monumental tragedies. Here is a good example: The schedule at this Southern sanctuary for the classics includes an updated ''Romeo and Juliet'' set in Miami (through June 28). The doomed lovers might seem even more contemporary than their ''West Side Story'' counterparts (July 18-Aug. 24). In between, the theater's master of fine arts acting students are serving up something lighter, ''The Beaux' Stratagem'' (July 11-19), the bawdy Restoration comedy by George Farquhar.

Richard Hyman, an independent housing and planning consultant hired by the county for the study, said there were two big reasons he thought the plan would work. To start with, office parks are typically created with more parking than they need, to meet standard zoning requirements. Additionally, the complexes are often built in campuslike settings, with room for more construction -- in this case, new residential buildings."

It took me my entire professional career to get a halfway decent approach to hitting a curveball. Give me a fastball every day of the week, and twice on Sundays. The curveball reality hit me all at once. I thought I could race through the minor league system on quick hands and exceptional coordination. That was until I ran into Gregg Olson, a pitcher who at one time was a dominant force in the Baltimore Orioles bullpen. He was known for his knee-buckling curveball, and he didn't disappoint.

Mr. Roy was the linchpin but not always the focal point of ''Miles From India,'' which generally featured about a dozen other musicians onstage. The concert grew out of an ambitious new double album of the same name on Times Square Records, conceived as a cross-cultural experiment by the producer Bob Belden.

Each receives a $25,000 prize. To put that $100,000 in context, the endowment is giving $2.5 million in direct opera grants this year and $7 million in other classical music grants, according to Dana Gioia, its chairman. Total grants to the arts are $72 million, with another $48 million sent to state arts councils to make their own allocations. Mr. Gioia said the awards have an &#8220;enormous symbolic value&#8221; and were established in part to stir awareness and appreciation of opera. While $25,000 could mean a lot more to a struggling singer, say, than to Mr. Levine, who may make more than that for a guest conducting engagement, Mr. Gioia called the prize &#8220;a lifetime achievement award.&#8221; &#8220;If the N.E.A. opera award is going to have credibility,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it has to recognize artists that work at the highest reaches of the art and to create, as it were, a hall of fame of American opera artists.

ABC led the night in total viewers, thanks to “Dancing With the Stars” at 8 (18.3 million) followed by the season finales of “Samantha Who?” at 9:30 (11 million) and “The Bachelor” at 10 (9.2 million). Among adults 18 to 49, ABC ranked third behind CBS, with its comedy lineup, and Fox, which eked out a victory in the 18-to-49 set courtesy of “House” at 9 (14.8 million), the night’s top-rated show among that age group. CBS won the 10 p.m. hour with “CSI: Miami” (13.7 million)."

The March 2007 show, which included an image juxtaposing coarse words with Christ&#8217;s crucifixion, offended the Orthodox Church, said Anna Stavitskaya, a lawyer for the accused, Yuri Samodurov. The exhibition comprised works deemed by other museum directors to be too shocking for display during the previous year. The art was visible only to viewers peeping through small holes in a white wall. Ms. Stavitskaya said the case was driven by government displeasure with the museum&#8217;s involvement in controversial projects. In 2005 Mr. Samodurov was convicted and fined by a Moscow court for instigating religious and ethnic hatred through &#8220;Caution, Religion!,&#8221; an exhibition intended to provoke discussion about the role of religion in modern society."

What is vital about the Turner Prize is that it creates informed debate about art.

2008-05-14T00:00:00Z,"The Tony nominations are in, and it would be difficult to come up with a season that presented a clearer portrait of where Broadway is headed and where it has been. The creative team behind ''In the Heights,'' a musical with a hip-hop, rap and salsa-infused score that led the field on Tuesday with 13 Tony nominations (including shots at best musical and best direction), is about as young as you get in a Broadway production: 6 of the show's 11 individual nominees are under 33. The show received good, but not glowing, reviews when it made its debut off Broadway last year and raised eyebrows when it moved to Broadway, but may get the last laugh when the Tony winners are announced at the ceremony at Radio City Music Hall on June 15. The success of ''Heights'' is due largely to the talent and charm of its creator, the 28-year-old Lin-Manuel Miranda, a Broadway newbie who has achieved the rare honor of being nominated both for leading actor and for composer/lyricist."

The Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art note with deep sadness the passing of Robert Rauschenberg. A beloved friend of the Museum, he was a maverick who worked without boundaries, continually rethinking traditional techniques and categories of media. He embraced everyday objects as suitable materials and his resulting combine paintings of the 1950s redirected the path of postwar art. Rauschenberg was first shown at the Whitney in the 1961 Annual and since then has been included in more than 70 other exhibitions at the Museum. The Whitney is proud to hold more than 50 of his works in our permanent collection, several of which were generous gifts of the artist. We will miss him--his creativity was matchless and he left a legacy that cannot be erased. We extend our condolences to his son Christopher and to his many dear friends. Leonard A. Lauder, Chairman Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Robert J. Hurst, President Adam D. Weinberg, Alice Pratt Brown Director RAUSCHENBERG--Robert. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art deeply mourn the loss of Robert Rauschenberg. We will remember Bob not only for his protean invention and deeply influential body of work, but also for his remarkable generosity, warmth, and exuberance. His opinion that ''there is no reason not to consider the world as one gigantic painting'' spoke volumes about the creative and open spirit in which he approached his art. Masterpieces such as the Combine paintings Bed and Rebus, both of 1955, are landmarks in this Museum's collection. We extend our deepest sympathy to his son Christopher and his companion Darryl Pottorf. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Honorary Chairman Robert B.

Our heartfelt condolences go to his entire family. RAUSCHENBERG--Robert. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation deeply mourn the loss of one of the most important artists, if not the most important artist, of the last half-century. Bob looked into the most chaotic aspects of modern existence and distilled from them an art of seemingly endless wit and invention. In a career that has spanned more than fifty years, he worked in the widest possible range of media, bringing his unerring eye to paintings, drawings, and sculpture, as well as performance and technology-based works. In 1997 the Guggenheim presented his retrospective in New York and Bilbao to record-setting crowds and to equally successful showings in Houston and Cologne. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his son, Christopher, his sister Janet Begneaud, his companion Darryl Pottorf, and his studio. This is an inconsolable loss for the art world. William Mack, Chairman, Jennifer Stockman, President, Thomas Krens, Director, Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, and Marc Steglitz, Interim Director, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum RAUSCHENBERG--Robert.

In 2000, amfAR publicly acknowledged his leadership and generosity with the Foundation's first Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS.

Apartheid was dismantled over several years beginning in 1990; the white government was not ousted a mere ''months'' after Williams played in the 1989 Super Bowl.

His lifelong interest in JDC's work and his concern for the welfare of the Jews then living in Ethiopia led him to undertake the establishment of JDC's first medical program in Gondar province. Together with his beloved wife, Peggy, who was always at his side, he made ten trips to Ethiopia between 1986 and 1991 to ensure the success of this effort.

The boards of the two companies said that, subject to certain conditions, St. George would recommend that shareholders accept Westpac's stock offer of 1.31 shares for each St. George share, which is a 28 percent premium to St. George's closing price on Friday, when the talks began."

Imagine, if you will, the poppy Italian sportswear company setting up an enormous temporary shop, and a series of giant, fantastical installations by artists like Moebius, Glenn Barr, tattooist Angelique Houtkamp and Junko Mizuno, featuring lip-synching models dressed up in bedazzled denim mermaid bikinis, trapeze artists and a winged male dancer in tighty whities trapped in a cage. There were thousands of assembled Euros to take it all in, mostly Fornarina's best customers and sales associates (ie, more Italians in France since the Italians ceded Sardinia in 1860). They were shopping up a storm, dancing to music by Aurore LeBlanc, and generally making way more noise than a museum-adjunct space should ever be forced to endure. Things got even louder with the appearance of Lindsay Lohan, who let slip that she's the new face of Fornarina come Spring '09. (The trendy, clubby label and the clubgoer who never saw a flippy party dress she didn't like are a good match if you ask us.) For any of you looking for dirt, we hate to disappoint you: Lohan was on time, well-behaved and all in all quite professional -- though she was indeed wearing leggings. In fact, she confirmed that she is going ahead with producing her own line, called 6126 after Marilyn Monroe's birthday, and admitted it was a retort to the many Internet critics who jeer at her for her leggings habit.

He has teamed up with Gaia, an online community, to create custom looks for its live prom this weekend. We talked to the catchphrase-loving designer about avatar couture, future projects and hot tranny messes.So what attracted you to this Gaia project? They told me, you know, I could design whatever I want. And what designer doesn't want that? I'm looking at one of your prom avatar outfits, and I'm loving this fur-trimmed cape situation. OMG, I know. Well, for the boys I was inspired by the British military. You know, I don't really do men's wear too much but I thought that would be, like, fabulous and who doesn't want to wear a cape to prom? I feel like this would be your outfit for the prom. Totally! And then underneath would be a gold lamé suit. I remember they showed pictures from your prom on Runway, right? Let's talk about it for a second. Tell me what you wore. Well, in the picture you saw I wore a sequined tailcoat that I made and, like, these big wide pants and this satin shirt and I had a mohawk. We looked like we were going to an '80s prom. It was fabulous.Siriano's designs for the virtual prom. That was senior prom? That was senior prom. My junior prom was even worse. I wore a three-piece linen cream suit with an ascot and Joaquin phoenix asked to take a picture of me and my date. It was fabulous. Wait, an ascot? Yeah, an ascot! It was Gucci, and it said ""Gucci"" all over it. A mohawk also? I think I had like a Flock of Seagulls thing going on. Ok, how were you not the prom king? I don't understand.Well, we didn't have prom king, but trust me, I would have been. So are you going to be at the virtual prom? I'm going to make a cameo appearance. Well, you are very busy. Are you going to bring a date? No, I'm going solo. Stag? Yeah, but I'm going to get bombarded by paparazzi there! Oh my god, prom paparazzi, of course. Have you ever been into virtual stuff before this? Like Second Life or anything? In all honesty I'm not a big Internet person. I don't blog, I am not technically good at computer anything. I'm a more an artsy, creative kind of person. I'm glad I went with this Gaia thing though because it's still about fashion, not just about virtual online. It's still about clothes and about people expressing themselves creatively. I am trying to keep everything more fashion-forward and not go the other direction. Ok, since we are talking about fomal attire, did you go to the Met gala? No, I didn't go! I was doing ""TRL"" that day with the Gaia divas. I was really sad to miss it, but next year will be bigger and better. Plus, I'll have a whole collection out and I will be able to promote it. Do you think you would've superhero-d it out for yourself if you had gone? Omigod, I would have been so superhero tranny, it would've been amazing. And so would my date, whoever I would've brought would have the most amazing gown for life. Who do you wish you could've dressed this year? And did you love or hate anything? I was bummed out by it because no one really went with total superhero. No one really went there! I'm so sad, I can't believe Victoria didn't ask me to dress her, because she looked a hot mess. I mean, she was wearing, like, a beaded nightie. I was, like, Hon-eeeyyy, what's wrong with you??I know snoozeville.She looked beautiful, but it was like a normal thing you would wear to any event. I wish they would go a little crazier.Let's back up to ""hot tranny messes."" I have been wondering, has there been backlash from the tranny community since you made that the biggest put-down of all time?No! the trannies LLLLLOVE me, are you kidding?? I kinda use it in a negative way sometimes but I'm meaning it with love. I mean, I love Candice Cayne - she's fabulous and we are so close - so I would never hate on trannies.Ok, so tell me. What's next? Are you doing fashion week this fall?I am, in September, so I hope you'll be there. It's not definite whether I am going to show in the tents. I'm thinking about doing an off-site venue just because it's just more my style. We'll see. I'm very excited, I'm working with sponsors right now. It's just a whirlwind. I'm doing costumes for a new movie, I have a book coming out, I'm doing a small capsule collection for bluefly.com.What's the book about?It's like a fashion kind of how-to book. It's, like, about being fierce and fabulous and about hair and makeup and trends. And it's also like a little biography about, you know, all my projects.Do you like doing so many different things? Or do you think that once you really get it going, after your first show, you're going to chill it out a bit and just focus on your clothes?Yeah, I mean there is also talk of me doing a reality show of my own, basically following me as a new fashion designer.I was wondering when that one was going to come up.You know, that might happen and if it's serious about me being a fashion designer then I will do something like that. But once I get everything in place and I show next season, I don't really wanna do anything else anymore. I mean, I'll do little branding projects and I would continue to do something with Gaia because it's virtual and I don't have to make hundreds of garments for them.Did you live for 'Saturday Night Live'? Were you loving it?Lived, loved, love Amy.It was kind of the best impression of all time, no?I know, it was actually scary because she looks so much like me. I thought it was so cool. I didn't really ever watch ""S.N.L."" before this happened so I was kinda in the dark but, OMG, loooooved it.Did you get nine million phone calls?Ummm, yeah. I didn't even get to see it when it was on though, I missed it. Luckily though, because Bravo and ""S.N.L."" are on the same floor at NBC, and I was there that day, I got to meet her the day before, which was great.What's left? What's the wish list? You've got ""S.N.L."" parody, possible reality show, a book Everything I've done is great, and all I hope is that after my show my clothes get bought and I'm in stores. That is the biggest goal. I mean, yes, lots of different people have bought my clothes and I'm still dressing people. I hope that they wear them to things and you can see them on them, you know?When does that happen? Have you had a big 'open the magazine and see your clothes on a celebrity' moment yet?I've had a couple little things. Heidi placed a big order and I'm dressing her for the Peabody Awards. And Victoria bought a bunch of stuff and she wore my pants and it was in Us Weekly. But, you know, I just hope that after September, after I show a new collection, it'll just go off the charts and people can wear it. That's all I want, it's not a big dream.Just a small dream, world famous fashion designer.It's just world fame, something so simple.It's all you're asking for, I don't see a problem with it.I don't either. I don't understand people; they need to get it together.What is the new 'fierce,' Christian, tell us all.There's not really a new one.But I saw you on ""Ugly Betty."" If it's banished, what replaces it?I feel that 'ferosh' and 'ferosha coutura' sound much more fabulous so I kinda throw that in. But I mean, 'fierce' will always be around, don't you worry."

In recognition of his extraordinary dedication and leadership, he was elected President of the American Surgical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the Society for Surgical Chairmen, and the Southern Surgical Association. In 1996, the American College of Surgeons presented him its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Award, and he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of University Surgeons in 2006. This March, UTMB's Department of Surgery established the James C. Thompson MD Distinguished Chair in Surgery to honor Dr. Thompson's contributions to the Department and to UTMB. Dr. Thompson's work took him to medical and educational institutions throughout the world. He served for brief periods as a visiting professor at over 200 medical schools and hospitals. He was the US-USSR Health Exchange Professor in 1973 and was named Honorary Professor for Life at the University of Beijing in 1991. Dr. Thompson is survived by his long time companion Bebe Jensen (Salt Lake City); his children, Patricia Thompson (Atlanta), Jan Thompson Brown (Austin), Gayle Thompson Crocker (Corpus Christi, TX), James C. Thompson, Jr. (Houston), John W. Thompson (College Station, TX), and his step daughter, Laura Fargas (Washington, DC). He is also survived by seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. A memorial service will be held at UTMB in Galveston on Monday, May 19, 2008 at 4pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the American Cancer Society."

Created last year to promote and unify the dance styles of different cultures and focus attention on the city's cabaret laws, which require proper licensing for any kind of rhythmic movement, the parade is expected to draw thousands of spectators along the route down Broadway and through the East Village, said Mahayana Landowne, an organizer. The celebration will culminate in a party in Tompkins Square Park, where many of the more than 100 dance groups from the Knicks City Dancers to an Albanian folkloric ensemble to the GrooveHoops, an artsy Hula-Hoop squad, will perform. There will also be free lessons and some site-specific choreography in and around the park, which should make for good brunch conversation in the neighborhood's cafes. At last year's event, above, part of the fun was watching disparate techniques merge, as spangled belly dancers gave lessons to zoot-suited Lindy hoppers, and vice versa. Experiencing it is even better."

2008-05-16T00:00:00Z,"JENNIFER JONES RETROSPECTIVE Among the celluloid dream girls manufactured by Hollywood in the 1940s, Jennifer Jones occupies a celestial niche. Beginning with her first major feature, ''The Song of Bernadette,'' in which she played a saintly French peasant who has a vision of the Virgin Mary, the character she represented on the screen was a spiritually exalted being who kept part of herself in reserve. Even when Ms. Jones went notoriously down and dirty to play Pearl Chavez, a sex-crazed half-Indian woman in ''Duel in the Sun,'' right, you had the titillating sense of a lady playing a tramp. (The opposite could be said of Lana Turner in dignified upscale roles.) These polarities are suggested by the title of the Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Ms. Jones's movies, ''Saint and Sinner: The Tempestuous Career of Jennifer Jones,'' at the Walter Reade Theater. Even as she crawled through the dirt, you still had a sense of her as the abstract embodiment of ideal femininity, 1940s style: a beautiful, empathetic trophy who was fundamentally untouchable."

The Art Newspaper, which reported the incident, called it “one of the most serious handling accidents known to have occurred in a U.K. museum in living memory.” The painting, one of three by Beccafumi depicting classical heroines, was part of the “Renaissance Siena” exhibition, which closed early this year. The damage was not made public until recently, when minutes of a National Gallery trustee meeting on Feb. 8 were posted online. Museum authorities ordered an investigation which is still going on, the publication reported, but the panels were restored immediately and the painting is now on public view. “Under present lighting in the gallery, the vertical strip of damage can hardly be seen when looked at straight on although it is just visible when the painting is viewed from the left side,” Martin Bailey wrote in The Art Newspaper."

But as a cult of authenticity has taken hold among global nomads, the impulse to engage has replaced the desire to escape. And they want more than just superficial encounters with “the natives”; they want their culture unfiltered. What the locavore movement did for food — giving the heirloom tomato from down the road more cachet than an ounce of beluga — this new humanism has done for travel."
2008-05-18T00:00:00Z,"With her boyish platinum mop and her penchant for wearing leopard-print pants with silver oxford shoes, the model Agyness Deyn is used to stopping people dead in their tracks. But recently it’s her G4530 Wild West Sweethearts guitar, from the Gretsch Americana limited-edition series, that’s been getting all the attention. “I carry it on my back everywhere I go,” she explains. “When I’m wearing it, people just come up to me and start chatting about it. I get to meet some cool people that way.” For Deyn, who is a new face for Shiseido and a Burberry favorite, crisscrossing the globe is all in a day’s work. In fact, she got her acoustic shredder last year in Japan, a surprise gift picked up by her boyfriend Josh Hubbard (of the band the Paddingtons). The guitar’s compact size makes it easy for lugging on the road, and the campy aesthetic perfectly riffs on Deyn’s own Paris-meets-Lower East Side style. “I love the whole Wild West thing. It reminds me of a Sailor Jerry tattoo,” she says. But Deyn’s love for her little red six-string is no passing fancy. “I think I’ll have it forever.”."

Still, hats are suddenly huge in town, most obviously in the Museumsquartier, where the cool kids are all rocking headgear. But this is no passing fancy for trucker caps or a Pete Doherty trilby. Driving the craze is the 105-year-old hatmaker Mühlbauer, which has lately been revitalized by the fourth-generation owner Klaus Mühlbauer’s clever designs and savvy marketing (Elfie Semotan shot his current ad campain). His newsboy caps, perforated leather fedoras and unisex turbans have become hipster staples. Mühlbauer. Seilergasse 10; 011-43-53-352-6912; muehlbauer.at. MARKUS EBNER."

2008-05-18T00:00:00Z,"When in Rome, why not eat as the Romans (really) do? One of the surest ways to get off the tourist grid is to read local guidebooks. Never mind if you don’t speak their language — a handful of guides to Italy and France have symbols, numerical ratings and pictures that will steer you toward your next discovery. “Osterie d’Italia,” from Slow Food Italy, recommends restaurants, organized geographically, with a snail icon to indicate that they follow Slow Food principles. If you like nonna-in-the-cucina places, it’s worth the weight. Another Italian bible, “Ristoranti d’Italia del Gambero Rosso,” groups restaurants, trattorias and wine bars regionally. A numerical score is based on a 100-point scale, and a meter indicates value for your money. But the most important symbols are the forks (for restaurants) and shrimps (for wine bars): if you see a place with three, go. In France, “Carnet de Route Omnivore” is for anyone serious about 21st-century French cuisine. The annual book lists 200 experimental restaurants and highlights the best dish at each (under the heading “Le Plat qui Change Tout”). Accompanying recommendations of nearby hotels are a bonus. The same publisher also recently released “Carnet de Vigne Omnivore,” a guide to 200 small, artisanal vineyards, with handy regional maps. And for architecture, art and history lovers, there’s “Ouverts au Public: Le Guide du Patrimoine en France,” which provides visiting information, photos and maps for more than 2,500 state-protected monuments.

2008-05-18T00:00:00Z,"The new book “A Road Trip Journal” (Phaidon, $250) documents a 1973 cross-country drive the photographer Stephen Shore made from New York to the West Coast and back, one of many such trips he took during the 1970s. The volume recreates the scrapbook Shore made at the time: what TV shows he watched (the Watergate hearings, “All in the Family”), the mileage he clocked, which locations he shot (“Sha-Mar Beauty Salon, Chestnut St.”). He also included every piece of paper he collected — receipts, parking and movie tickets, and, most important, postcards. “I found them fascinating because they were not trying to be works of art,” he says. “They just show you the main street, the so-and-so motel. I was attracted to that matter-of-factness.” Ultimately, it was that matter-of-factness that had a big influence on his own pictures; although made with a view camera on a tripod, they are printed to look like everyday snapshots."

2008-05-18T00:00:00Z,"Stroll into Cynthia’s Ristorante in downtown Paducah, Ky., on any given Friday night and you’ll likely find a gaggle of artists holding court at the end of the bar, their animated conversations fueled by Finlandia cosmopolitans and Chambord martinis. In the dimly lit dining room toward the back, locals tuck into twice-baked Montrachet goat-cheese soufflés or oak-grilled pork tenderloin wrapped in apple-wood-smoked bacon. The vibe is faintly reminiscent of Elaine’s on a Thursday night, which is a bit of a shock since this Southern town on the western tip of Kentucky is a long way from the Upper East Side."
2008-05-18T00:00:00Z,"For the musician Tori Amos, the best way to travel is to step onstage. “Performing is like taking a magic carpet ride,” she says. Her songs cover a wide range of subjects, from sexuality to religion to designer accessories. (Sample lyric: “Somewhere in the hills of Ireland, there’s a Prada bag.”) “Comic Book Tattoo,” an anthology of graphic art inspired by her songs, is due out in July. The book follows last year’s “Legs and Boots,” a series of live “bootlegs” sold through her Web site, and her American Doll Posse World Tour; ever the provocateur, she invited Pope Benedict XVI to her show in Rome. (He never R.S.V.P.’ed.) Despite his absence, Amos still managed to feel a higher power. Of giving a concert, she says: “It’s a legal way to get ecstasy.

Wickham is tall and graceful, with tan skin and a salt-and-pepper buzz cut. He grew up on a farm on the island’s north coast and now owns the Exceptional Kangaroo Island touring company, which has been taking travelers around this island, 10 miles off the coast of southern Australia, for nearly 20 years. Beyond the dusty windshield of our Land Cruiser scrolled great arcades of silvery gum trees, tossing dappled sunlight onto the road. Every once in a while the greenery dropped away, revealing the island’s famous limestone cliffs and aquamarine water, bright flashes of color amid sedate browns and greens. “K. I. encapsulates everything people were hoping to find here in Australia,” Wickham said. “You can have a lot of people lost in the landscape and you never feel that the land is crowded.”."

You know, those summers where three months last for years and years?” As soon as I made landfall on Capri’s earthier neighbor, 15 miles off the coast of Naples, I knew exactly what he meant.

Our own experience and a vast body of rigorous research suggest a few simple directives. Support prevention programs that start early, are rooted in community values and resources and are sustained over time. Focus on resources instead of deficits; embrace the hopes, skills and positive values of youth and communities, and build on that foundation. Teach alternatives to violence: anger management, empathy, communication, cooperation, conflict resolution and active community engagement help young people not only avoid violence; they also help inoculate them against the hopelessness that breeds these cycles.

Smarty Jones commands $100,000 a mating and sees 110 mares a season. Iavarone says Big Brown will not run as a 4-year-old. If he wins the Belmont and becomes the first Triple Crown champion since Affirmed in 1978, he will probably not run again."

Her first ride in an Old Car was from Times Square to the Worlds Fair in a 1903 Curved Dash Oldsmobile driven by Henry Austin Clark Jr., of Glen Cove, NY. She would remain at A.Q. until 1981. It is my opinion as well as others, that A.Q. would not have been as it grew to be without her skills, leadership and hard work. She went free lance, and also became the Editor for the Classic Car Club of America, a job she would fulfill for 26 plus years. Her first Book as a free lance author was The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805-1942, with Henry Austin Clark Jr. The Book has become a must for Automotive Writers as well as Hobbyists through out the World. Her last Book just out is Walter L. Marr, Buick's Amazing Engineer. Her writings are so massive it would be hard to list them all here. For more about her google her: Beverly Rae Kimes. Her Books and Articles have received more Awards than any other Author in the Automotive Field. She was referred to by Life Magazine as the ''nation's foremost automotive scholar'' ACD Club, bestow her Woman of The Year Award, CCCA with their Distinguished Service Award, Distinguished Service Citation from the Automotive Hall of Fame, she became the first historian to receive this award, A Lifetime Achievement Award as well as the Best of Books honor from IAM Awards. She served as the Voice of the Burn Concours d'Elegance of the Eastern United States for 17 years. She was also an Honorary Judge at The Pebble Beach Concours.

The fruit trees in the Willamette Valley may be in full blossom, but in Oregon it's November in May. The map of counties that Hillary Clinton won big this year shows a broad swath of Appalachia and rural America, places where a Democrat is unlikely to prevail in the general election. The scab of racial animus can be thick in those counties, judging by exit polls of Clinton supporters who say they would never vote for a black man, and by anecdotal reporting."

2008-05-19T00:00:00Z,"This is not how it was supposed to happen. It is not, at least, how things looked in Virginia. At the Signature Theater in Arlington, ''Glory Days,'' the four-man musical about growing up, was a hit this year. The reviews were mixed to positive, but the real story was the show's creators, Nick Blaemire, 23, and James Gardiner, 24. So young, andto have written a musical! Two relatively green New York producers offered to take the show to the big dance of Broadway, and it looked like the beginning of a showbiz fairy tale. But after 17 previews, a sheaf of bad reviews, meager ticket sales and one opening night, ''Glory Days'' closed at the Circle in the Square Theater on Broadway, most likely losing its entire $2.5 million investment. It was the first show to close after one regular performance since 2003, when ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' had said everything she had to say by the opening-night curtain."

2008-05-19T00:00:00Z,"In ''Dances at a Gathering,'' Jerome Robbins made a classic of dance and theater, a work that irresistibly invited multiple interpretations that Robbins both planted and discouraged. At New York City Ballet, the company for which he made it in 1969, ''Dances'' has been performed with a kind of quiet understatement that during the last decade and a half has dimmed the ballet into near-dullness. The Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, by contrast, had not danced it for 32 years -- until Saturday. The old Royal Ballet version, performed between 1970 and 1976, was a high point in the company's history. Instead of understatement, however, it fell victim in its later years to overinflection: in particular, to charm. The new Royal Ballet production (I watched both performances on Saturday) is strong on charm too, but not excessively so; and it draws on the best virtue of today's Royal Ballet: highly individual soloists, male and female."

Backstage on Sunday night, Mr. Chesney said that although he favored the inclusion of fans, he did not think they should determine the academy&#8217;s most important award, The Associated Press reported. He emphasized that his criticism was directed at the industry, not the fans, and said that this year&#8217;s voting method amounted to &#8220;complete disrespect&#8221; of the artists, turning the award &#8220;into a sweepstakes to see who can push people&#8217;s buttons the hardest on the Internet.&#8221; The academy did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

2008-05-20T00:00:00Z,"RAUSCHENBERG--Robert, died May 12, 2008, at his Captiva studio of heart failure. Considered by many to be the greatest living artist, Bob Rauschenberg made artworks that reflected his boundless, enthusiastic appreciation of the fabric of daily life and his passionate curiosity about the world. As a young artist, he couldn't always afford new canvases but he couldn't stop painting either so he would make new paintings right over his old ones. He was a major innovator in the fields of painting, sculpture, dance and print making. Bob's muse and friend Illeana Sonnabend said of his art, ''There was a spiritual quality in his works, as well as a poetic and ephemeral quality. People like to hold on to what they know. Bob likes to shake them out of their habits.'' He was incredibly generous and openhearted. He would cook fabulous dinners for 10 or 20 people and then invite everyone in range to eat. He approached life with a child's optimistic exuberance and was a dogged warrior for peace and the environment. Bob never turned his back on anyone in need. Bob is survived by his sister Janet Rauschenberg Begneaud and her husband, Byron, of Lafayette LA; son, Christopher Rauschenberg and his wife Janet Stein, of Portland OR; nephew Rick Begneaud; grandnephew, Dylan Rauschenberg Begneaud, grandniece, Logan Coleen Begneaud, all of Mill Valley CA, and friend and collaborator Darryl Pottorf of Captiva, FL. To commemorate Bob's long standing involvement in his community a memorial exhibition at the Bob Rauschenberg Gallery, Edison College, Fort Myers, FL will be planned and announced in the near future and a tribute to his art and life is being planned for New York, NY. Bob loved flowers but he would rather have you honor his memory, if you so choose, by making a donation to Change Inc., a foundation he created to give money to artists for emergency needs. Donations may be mailed to Change, Inc., PO Box 54, Captiva, FL 33924."

Both Mr. Kelly and the woman, now 23, deny they are the people on the tape, and one of Mr. Kelly’s lawyers, Sam Adam Jr., told the jurors during his opening statement that the videotape is “at best a copy of a copy” and that Mr. Kelly was not the man on the tape. “Not a single witness can tell you that is him on the tape,” he said. If convicted, Mr. Kelly could face as much as 15 years in prison."
2008-05-21T00:00:00Z,"Jerusalem, the Holy City, has effectively banned sex. No, not the act but the three-letter word that appears elsewhere in billboard advertising for the new film “Sex and the City.” Sex in the city became an issue when the advertising company Maximedia told the news media that it would not post billboards featuring Sarah Jessica Parker, above, one of the stars, in deference to requests from city officials concerned about “offending public sensitivities” by mentioning “sex,” Agence France-Presse reported. Then the distributor, Forum Films, said that without “sex” there would be no billboards in Jerusalem or Petah Tikva, a town near Tel Aviv that has a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish population. But in other Israeli cities, “sex” in advertising is O.K."

2008-05-22T00:00:00Z,"An obituary on May 13 about Murray Jarvik, a psychopharmacologist who was among the first to study LSD, referred incorrectly to the chemical compound D-lysergic acid, which he studied in the 1950s. It is a precursor of LSD, not LSD itself. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the publication history of The Village Voice, quoting an account Dr. Jarvik gave in a 2001 interview. The newspaper was founded in 1955; it did not exist in 1953, when, by Dr. Jarvik’s account, he placed an advertisement in the paper seeking subjects for an LSD study at Mount Sinai Hospital."

And while she led the group for the longest period of time under the title of president — changed from “chairman” during the tenure of her immediate predecessor — she is not in fact the A.C.L.U.’s longest-serving leader. (That would be Harry Ward, who served as chairman for 20 years.) The article also misspelled the surname of one of Ms. Strossen’s debating partners over the years.

2008-05-22T00:00:00Z,"Lou Pearlman, right, the former manager of pop acts like the Backstreet Boys and &#8217;N Sync, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Wednesday for running a decades-long investment scheme that defrauded investors of $300 million. In a sentencing hearing at Federal District Court in Orlando, Fla., Judge G. Kendall Sharp gave Mr. Pearlman an unusual incentive to pay back his investors, offering to reduce the sentence by one month for every $1 million he repays. Mr. Pearlman, 53, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a Ponzi scheme in which he used fake accounting documents to lure people to invest in two companies that existed only on paper. Mr. Pearlman fled the country early last year, once federal authorities began investigating him, and in June he was found at a hotel in Bali, registered under the name A. Incognito Johnson. Larry Rifken, a lawyer representing victims of the schemes, said in a statement: &#8220;The Creditors Committee is delighted with Judge Sharp&#8217;s ruling today on Mr. Pearlman&#8217;s sentence and believes that Judge Sharp did an excellent job in maximizing Mr. Pearlman&#8217;s incentive to cooperate with the Trustee and the Committee in identifying, locating and monetizing any remaining undisclosed assets.&#8221;."

Having lost her studio space to the rising tide of development, Ms. Rethorst worked with what she had: her living room and seven of the best dancers around, including Vicky Shick and Jeanine Durning. The resulting all-female performance, in which she recreated her living room in the theater, was magical: a commentary on the dire economic state of contemporary dance in New York that completely trumped its impoverished conditions and offered a portrait of human relations that was at once utterly mysterious and unerringly true. In ''208 East Broadway, Part 2: Window,'' which will have its premiere at Danspace Project on Thursday, Ms. Rethorst has branched out -- sort of. Using video, she has widened her scope by incorporating choreography created in the park that is visible through her living room window. (Perhaps she has borrowed a plant or two.)"

2008-05-23T00:00:00Z,"In 1954, Frank Lloyd Wright provided Virginia and Don E. Lovness, then in their 20s, with a design for a Usonian-style house. With constant guidance from Wright, the couple built a 1,800-square-foot house, which they called the Studio, on their 20-acre lakefront property. It was completed in 1957 and features a master suite, a large living room overlooking the lake, a wing specifically designed for children, and two bathrooms. In 1974, the couple built an 800-square-foot cottage on the property, as well. It has a loft-style sitting room, a living area and a deck that overlooks the lake. Both the cottage and the main house have dolomite fireplaces, and the main house has radiant heat floors.

Beloved husband of Connie and devoted father of Kim Hamilton Gottshall and Jill Hamilton, and proud grandfather of Katherine Howland Gottshall and John Hamilton Gottshall. Born and bred a New Yorker. After graduation from Friends Seminary (1932) and Williams College (1936), he embarked on a 49-year career as a journalist, first in various editorial positions at The Literary Digest and the Daily Mirror, followed by national and international affairs at Newsweek. From there, it was an easy jump to public relations, first at Arabian American Oil Company and then Texaco, contributing his journalistic expertise to corporate publications and protecting the sanctity of the English language from the ''gobbledygook of corporatese.'' Retired in 1986 as Director of Public Relations Services. Inducted into the Army of the United States, in 1942, he initially served in the Signal Corps, where he edited the first manual ever published on something he had never heard of called ''radar.'' He transferred to Air Force Intelligence in 1944 and served in the Estimate Section, Joint Intelligence, Pacific Ocean Areas (stationed in Guam). He was commended for his service by Admiral C. W. Nimitz, who said: ''his estimates were used as the basis for operational planning by the highest commands in the Pacific Ocean Areas.'' Member of the Players Club from 1940 through 2008, he was elected a lifetime member in May 2008."
2008-05-23T00:00:00Z,"'THE ECCENTRICITIES OF A NIGHTINGALE' Every season a handful of performances set the city's theater watchers abuzz with excitement. This year has been unusually rich in quality work from actors on Broadway, from the fisticuffs of ''August: Osage County'' to the sweaty farcing of Mark Rylance and company in ''Boeing-Boeing'' to the filigreed performances in ''South Pacific.'' I'm sure they'll linger long in the memory. But the less traveled byways of the city's theater industry are home to performances no less powerful, no less indelible. Too often they pass unheralded; nobody can see everything, after all. I was reminded of this last weekend, when I scorned a rare sunny spring afternoon to catch the production of Tennessee Williams's rarely seen ''Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' at the Clurman Theater on Theater Row. (''Nightingale'' is a 1951 revision of ''Summer and Smoke,'' which Williams preferred to the original.) A colleague's enthusiastic review suggested that this production, from the small Actors Company Theater, was the rare staging of a Williams play that delivered his poetry and his emotional power intact."

2008-05-23T00:00:00Z,"ROGER BROWN: 'THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE' The painter Roger Brown forged one of the most distinctive styles of the past half-century. He was one of the Chicago Imagists who came of age in the 1960s, among a group that included Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke and Gladys Nilsson. Brown died in 1997, and his work has not been seen in New York over the past 10 years. This exhibition of paintings from 1971 (including ''Pasadena Garden Residence,'' above) to 1991 will delight his fans and should be a revelation for people unfamiliar with his work. Mr. Brown created expansive, simplified and mysteriously luminous landscapes and townscapes in which natural and artificial elements conform to grid patterns. In some ways his paintings look as if they were made by a self-taught visionary. They're technically rudimentary and rely on certain formulaic devices. The land is always divided by rows of bristly, glowing bushes; buildings described by thin black lines have bright yellow windows framing occupants' shadows; and puffy clouds fill the sky in improbable patterns."

2008-05-23T00:00:00Z,"'ALICE IN WONDERLAND' Unless you're an Oxford don with a fondness for nonsense rhymes, onomatopoeia and ceaseless puns, any faithful adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books is likely to be more fun to watch than to listen to. That is mostly true of the New Acting Company's ''Alice in Wonderland,'' playing through this weekend in Greenwich Village. Its script, by Brainerd Duffield, includes large excerpts from Carroll's original text, drawn from both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and its ''Through the Looking Glass'' sequel. But this production is so visually rich and energized that children unused to unadulterated Alice-isms aren't likely to mind that a lot of the dialogue is jabber -- or ''Jabberwocky,'' whose non-English English is recited several times. The stars, in addition to Zoë Frazer (who makes a spunky Alice, seated above with Maxine Dannatt, left, and Théo Klein) and the rest of the talented cast, are clearly Mark Salinas, the costume designer; Gregg Bellon, who created the set and the lighting; and Margeaux Lucas, who designed the art. Large, twirling panels, painted with scenes like chessboards and fairy-tale landscapes, form the backdrops, and ingenious inventions portray characters like the Walrus (an oversize hand puppet), the Mouse Alice meets in the Pool of Tears (an enormous rod puppet) and the Cheshire Cat (a mural-like design with a lingering fluorescent smile). The Caterpillar alone is worth the price of admission: partly a tower of fringed fabric, it has two children and an adult stacked within it, totem-pole-style, with their arms forming the creature's legs."

2008-05-23T00:00:00Z,"'CHARLES BOYER AND THE ART OF SEDUCTION' Like all the best movie actors, Charles Boyer knew how to do a lot with a little: the just-raised eyebrow, the hint of a grin, the slight hesitation. Physically, his biggest gifts were his eyes and a deep, purring voice that sounded equally good whispering sweet nothings or delivering smart, fast lines. ''I've always been full of words,'' his character says in Mitchell Leisen's ''Hold Back the Dawn'' (1941). And it's all that persuasive, complicit, amused talk that makes Boyer a great romantic lead (and a great comic actor too). In Hollywood movies, Boyer was able to convey Gallic charm without being a cartoon Frenchman. (Though he inspired one: the skunk Pepe Le Pew.) He also had a career in France that, with gaps, stretched from 1920 to the 1960s. The Film Society of Lincoln Center series ''Charles Boyer and the Art of Seduction'' includes eight American and two French movies, one early and one late. In ''Le Bonheur,'' a rarity from 1934 as nutty as it is interesting, he plays an anarchist who shoots a film star as a political statement. (She survives and, lo and behold, falls for him.) In Max Ophuls's masterpiece ''The Earrings of Madame de ...'' (1953), Boyer gives a deftly complex performance that is completely in sync with the director's vision of a ''superficially superficial'' society."

Ports give way to waterfront parks, cobblestone to paved roads, and other markers of each age vanish, only to be replaced by new ones.

It is clear that this administration has no intention to serve the public's best interest, but in fact is subjugating at all costs all that would counter its sole objective, namely the profits of its in-crowd.I have never had so many alarms going off in my head. America is in trouble! The only insights into the administration's wrongdoings are the investigative and analytical reporting of the media.Thank you to the reporters Nina Bernstein and David Barstow, to David McCraw, a vice president and assistant general counsel for The Times, and to you. Robert PalmerCastro Valley, Calif., May 11, 2008 ● ●Re ""The Preacher's New Pulpit"" (May 4):I strongly disagree with you on the question of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and The Times's coverage of his recent public and television appearances.I felt that the issue was covered ad nauseam everywhere and ran 24/7 on cable news channels. Yes, it was news, but it became the dominant news of the week at the expense of other more important stories.I appreciate that The Times showed some restraint while still covering the story well.Elizabeth KilroyNew York, May 5, 2008 ●Your column about the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. scandal should have also noted the failure of The Times to discuss the anti-American and outrageous statements of many men of the cloth, such as, but not limited to, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the Rev. Pat Robertson, Rev. John C. Hagee and even the Rev. Billy Graham.While The Times has provided article after article about Mr. Wright (and Senator Barack Obama), there's been far less coverage of the other reverends who have made similar statements. In the Week in Review of May 4, we read about the ""fiery theology"" of black preachers, with no mention of the many other (white) preachers who have said far worse.Where is the balance?Vicki G. CheikesBoca Raton, Fla., May 6, 2008 ●I was interested in the difference between the coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. in the paper and on The Caucus blog on the Web site.Perhaps you are right, and The Times should have reported more on the content of Mr. Wright's recent speeches in the paper. But nothing substantial in the speeches had not been reported before, and nothing in them was not being reported endlessly on cable news. It seems that the story really was that Mr. Wright was saying these things again, which to me came through in the reporting in the paper.The Caucus blog, however, was all Wright all the time for at least three days that week. It was infuriating.The content of Mr. Wright's speeches is available on television and on the Internet. How much of this do you want to put on the front page? The Wright story represents a great distraction from real issues, and it is entirely media-generated. Now, the media are a story, but they are becoming the main story. And that's not good.Christopher WilsonMadison, Wis., May 4, 2008 ●While I very much appreciate your column about the paper's coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., The Times was hardly the first or only media outlet not to cover Mr. Wright in a proper sense. I don't see why what Mr. Wright says in his crazy rants should be given the news attention that it has been given.What kind of impact will that have on the issues of the day? Does his hateful comments help a family with their bills, or help get us out of Iraq?I am a realist and know the news media will cover him because of his ties to Senator Barack Obama, though for the reasons I just stated, I wish it weren't so.Steven M.

2008-05-24T00:00:00Z,"The $16.8 million sale of a landmark Modernist house by Richard Neutra has been derailed, Christie’s said on Friday. An unidentified bidder bought the 1946 residence, the Kauffmann House in Palm Springs, Calif., above, at Christie’s auction of postwar and contemporary art in New York on May 13. But Marc Porter, president of Christie’s, said in a brief telephone interview on Friday that the deal had fallen apart. “The contract has been terminated by the seller by reason of a breach of its terms by the buyer,” he said. He declined to identify the buyer or to say whether that person had failed to deliver a payment. The sellers, Brent Harris and Beth Edwards Harris, who have divorced, could not immediately be reached for comment. The midcentury landmark of glass, steel and stone sold at the low end of its estimate of $15 million to $25 million at the auction. It was commissioned by the department store owner Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., the same client who commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build Fallingwater in Pennsylvania in the 1930s."

2008-05-24T00:00:00Z,"What can a popular ex-president do as a second act? Collaborate with his wife, of course — or try to. And in the former Czech leader Vaclav Havel’s case, return to his roots on the stage. Mr. Havel’s first new play in 20 years opened in the Archa Theater in Prague on Thursday. The play, “Odchazeni” (“Leaving”), is about a chancellor who must re-adjust to civilian life and the loss of power after being forced out by his former deputy. (Mr. Havel, now 71, whose last presidential term ended in 2003, has said he wrote most of the play before taking office.) It alludes to “King Lear” and “The Cherry Orchard” but has some postmodern touches: the playwright himself appears in a recorded voice-over. The play received mostly positive reviews in the Czech press. But this highly anticipated absurdist comedy was marred by some personal drama when Mr. Havel’s wife, Dagmar Havlova, who he said helped inspire the work, was barred from performing in it. The National Theater of Prague, which was originally scheduled to stage it, cited a policy against guest actors in rejecting Ms. Havlova for a role written for her. Mr. Havel responded by shopping the show to other theaters; citing health problems, Ms. Havlova eventually dropped out of the production altogether shortly before it opened at the Archa. In September the play is scheduled to run at the Orange Tree Theater in London."

Mr. Kelly’s defense team filed a motion to call to the stand Jim DeRogatis, the pop music critic for The Chicago Sun-Times, who anonymously received the tape in 2002. Judge Vincent Gaughan said lawyers for The Sun-Times had until next Friday to respond. The trial is to resume on Tuesday. Mr. Kelly has pleaded not guilty, and the woman, now 23, said to be the girl on the tape, has denied that she is."

Although the number of viewers for the show’s fourth-season conclusion declined by nearly 5 million from a year ago (22.6 million), it still led the night by a wide margin over its nearest competitor, NBC’s “Deal or No Deal,” which garnered 10.3 million viewers from 8 to 9:30 p.m. NBC finished third for the night, earning mediocre results from 9:30 to 11 with the start of the sixth edition of “Last Comic Standing” (5.9 million). Fox ranked second over all, thanks to the fourth-season premiere of “So You Think You Can Dance,” which averaged 8.6 million viewers from 8 to 10. Despite its modest number of total viewers, the Fox dancing contest fared particularly well among adults 18 to 49, winning the 8 o’clock hour in that demographic, ahead of ABC’s finale of “Ugly Betty,” which drew 8.8 million total viewers.

He parachuted into Normandy the night before D-Day as a member of the 101st Airborne Division and received serious leg injuries after 17 days of combat. He was subsequently awarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Infantry Combat Badge and France's Liberation Medal. Joe devoted the last several decades to the two great passions in his life: his family, and especially his devoted wife of 46 years, Caral; and not-for-profit endeavors, particularly the Museum of Modern Art film department and his alma mater, Yale University. His loss will leave a great void, and he will be missed by his many friends and family members. We will especially miss Joe's smiling face, his curiosity about every facet of life, his astute political insights and his unfailing courage. He is survived by his wife, Caral; his three stepchildren Glenn Greenberg, Stephen Greenberg and Alva Greenberg; and ten grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to The Museum of Modern Art Film Department, 11 West 53 Street, NY, NY 10019-5497.

Dr. Sutton had just returned the night before from a business trip to Japan, where he had given a lecture on Vermeer and the Delft School, his specialty, and discussed loans of artworks for future shows at the Bruce. Now he was listening as Nancy Hall-Duncan, senior curator of art, reported on plans for a 2009 show devoted to the French Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley. Ms. Hall-Duncan's summary, which included details of loan requests and a complementary costume exhibition, was as close as Mr. Sutton would get to working with art that day. Earlier that morning he had met with a board member, then attended a governance committee meeting. Immediately after the staff briefing came another meeting, one with visiting members of the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism. By 6 p.m. he had left the museum, heading to what he called a ''donor cultivation event'' at the home of a local collector."

2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"THE United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last week that the Treasury Department's paper currency discriminates against the blind and those with poor vision because the bills are the same size no matter their value. In addition, the department didn't show that it would be too burdensome to change the bills. So what's to be done? It's not clear yet. Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said, ''We're reviewing the court's ruling at this juncture, and no determination has been made as to the government's next step.'' Since that step won't be taken immediately, the Week in Review asked three graphic designers to offer their solutions. Scott Stowell of Open, a New York design firm, took his cue from countries where bills of different denominations vary in size. Woody Pirtle of Pirtle Design, also in New York, borrowing from greeting-card technology, has attached a paper-thin chip that speaks the denomination. Tamara Shopsin, an illustrator, proposes perforations in the shape of icons, each symbolic of the president depicted. STEVEN HELLER"

''I work for Air Baltic, and it's very commonplace for my colleagues to go for vacation to Bangkok, which I consider too crowded. My boyfriend and I decided instead to stay closer to nature. The main difference between Australia and other places I have traveled is the natural harmony -- wild nature and people living together. The nature in Australia is its history and culture at the same time. The most unforgettable thing was the Blue Mountains National Park. We got a bit lost that day and found this lookout point almost by accident, following our intuition. I still remember the lovely excitement we had at the end of this sandy road, where we discovered a point that hadn't been used in a long time, looking over Wentworth Falls and all the might of nature. It was our first stop on our five-day trip through the park, and the sun created a lovely rainbow over the falls. It was an amazing play of colors in the water. I could never get tired of traveling in Australia, I think.'' As told to J. R. Romanko"

2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,INTERNATIONAL REPORT ON DEFORESTATION
2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"O'BRIEN--Fr. Frederick J., S.J. , died on Monday, May 19, 2008, at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Hollywood, California. He was 76 years of age. He had been a member of the Society of Jesus for 58 years and a priest for 46 years. Father O'Brien was born in Hyde Park, MA on October 31, 1931, and was baptized at Most Precious Blood Church in the Archdiocese of Boston. He attended Boston College High School from 1945 to 1949 and entered the Society of Jesus on July 30, 1949 at Shadowbrook in Lenox, MA, where he also did his first studies as a Jesuit. He received his theological training in preparation for priesthood at Woodstock College in Woodstock, MD, and was ordained a priest there on June 17, 1962. Father O'Brien held a Master's Degree in History from the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, but achieving that degree did not put an end to his continuous study of history and his keen sense for historical detail which frequently informed his conversation. He taught history at Boston College from 1968 to 1971 and at Fairfield University from 1971 to 1976. In 1976 Father O'Brien's career took him from Jesuit universities into Jesuit high schools. Although he was always a Bostonian at heart, it was at this time that Father O'Brien moved to New York City. There he began to teach history at Regis High School in Manhattan, but almost immediately he moved into high school administrative positions at Regis High School and then at Fordham Preparatory in the Bronx. He returned to New England to be Principal and later to be both Principal and President at Bishop Connolly High School in Fall River, only to return again to the Big Apple to assume the office of Principal at Regis High School from 1983 to 1989. Father O'Brien became Assistant to the New York Provincial for Secondary Education from 1990 to 2001. Having finished his career in secondary education, Father O'Brien indulged his interest in history by becoming the New York Province Archivist. Fluent in English, Spanish and German, Father O'Brien helped manage many of the international correspondences from the Provincial's office. In addition, Father O'Brien wrote the obituaries of deceased Jesuits for various publications. Father O'Brien fulfilled these duties until he died. Besides having been a scholar, an administrator and a historian, Father O'Brien was a devoted priest. He spent several weeks each year on the west coast providing pastoral care in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, especially at Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood, CA. It was during his last visit to the west coast that Father O'Brien fell ill, received hospitalization, and died. Father O'Brien is survived by his cousins Richard O'Brien of Humarock, MA, Patricia O'Brien of West Roxbury, MA, and Robert O'Brien of Washington Depot, CT.

2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"HAMILTON--Dr. Harlan (Hal) Bernhardt , of New York City, formally of Massachusetts died peacefully, surrounded by family in Manchester, NH on March 23, 2008. Hal was born in Medford MA, on November 29, 1927; the firstborn of Harlan Lombard Hamilton and Jeanie (Bernhardt) Hamilton. The Hamilton family first settled in Berwick, Maine in 1751, Hal was quite proud of his Maine heritage. After graduating from Boston Latin School in 1946, he enlisted in the US Navy where he served in Shanghai during World War II. After serving his country as a Navy medic, Hal enrolled in the University of Colorado, graduating with a degree in English. He continued his education earning a Masters Degree from Columbia University and a Doctor of Education degree from Boston University. Hal shared his passion for literature and the arts as an Associate Professor of English at Jersey City State College in New Jersey. Hal wrote published articles and plays, culminating his writing with the publication of his book ''Lights and Legends''. The book is a Historical Guide to Lighthouses of Long Island Sound, Fishers Island Sound, and Block Island Sound. He was an avid sailor, both in Long Island Sound and in the Caribbean. Writing his book combined Hal's passion for sailing and literature. The book was published in 1987, and has had multiple printings making it available today through many booksellers. A member of the Screen Actor's Guild, Opera, Film, Off Broadway Theater, and Television were all stages Hal appeared on. Hal was a resident of New York City for over 40 years. ''There's no place like it,'' Hal would often exclaim. Hal was a volunteer at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, and has donated his stamp collection on Film to the Museum. He was a Senior Mentor for Mt. Sinai Hospital, working with future physicians. Hal is survived by two sisters Beverly Royce of Phoenix, AZ and Nancy Wiley of Halifax, MA and his brother James Hamilton of Billerica, MA. He was predeceased by a brother Norman. He enjoyed time with his many nieces and nephews, sharing stories of family history, New York, and his many travels around the world. Hal was a founding member of several AA chapters in Manhattan. A Memorial Service will be held for Harlan Hamilton at St. Anthony of Padua Church, Sullivan and Houston St. in New York City on Saturday, May 31 at 2pm. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Hal's memory to the NYC Alzheimer's Association, 360 Lexington Ave, NY, NY 10017."

Dr. Sutton had just returned the night before from a business trip to Japan, where he had given a lecture on Vermeer and the Delft School, his specialty, and discussed loans of artworks for future shows at the Bruce. Now he was listening as Nancy Hall-Duncan, senior curator of art, reported on plans for a 2009 show devoted to the French Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley. Ms. Hall-Duncan's summary, which included details of loan requests and a complementary costume exhibition, was as close as Mr. Sutton would get to working with art that day. Earlier that morning he had met with a board member, then attended a governance committee meeting. Immediately after the staff briefing came another meeting, one with visiting members of the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism. By 6 p.m. he had left the museum, heading to what he called a ''donor cultivation event'' at the home of a local collector."

Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested corporate greed was a factor pushing up oil prices.

2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"TEXT BY T. COLE RACHEL It's a classic story, but with a French twist. In 2004, a group of high-school friends with little or no musical experience decide to start a band. Their playing lacks finesse but has plenty of enthusiasm. Punchy, two-minute songs become their calling card. Fame ensues. Meet the Plastiscines: Marine Neuilly, Katty Besnard and Louise Basilien. The Paris-based band's 2007 major label debut, ''LP1,'' may be only 28 minutes long, but it packs a punch -- all power chords,tambourines and odes to the endless party. Think '60s garage rock by way of the Ramones and Françoise Hardy. From left: Marine Neuilly is in a Thread Social dress and Jill Stuart top. Katty Besnard wears a Chanel dress. Louise Basilien wears a Brian Reyes dress and Yves Saint Laurent top. Au Revoir Simone's Erika Forster, Annie Hart and Heather D'Angelo are known for folky keyboard lullabies suited for night drives and long, solitary walks. On their latest album, ''The Bird of Music,'' the Brooklyn-based trio conjure the ghosts of AM radio past. But for an act that relies almost exclusively on vintage synthesizers and drum machines (all three members play keyboards and sing), the sound is remarkably organic and decidedly old-fashioned. Twee musical musings about embracing the sunshine and measuring the nighttime stars that could easily become too precious for words are tempered with a note of melancholy. From left: Erika Forster wears an Alexander Wang romper. Larkspur & Hawk necklace. Annie Hart is in a Roberto Cavalli blouse. Jill Stuart skirt. Lulu Frost and Alexis Bittar necklaces. Belmacz ring. Heather D'Angelo wears a Brian Reyes camisole and headband. Dior by John Galliano slip. Max Azria shorts. David Yurman ring. Lulu Frost bracelet. It's almost redundant to talk about the weird and wonderful musical gifts that Iceland has given us: Bjork, Mum, Gus Gus. . . . Add to that list Amiina. Edda Run Olafsdottir, Hildur Arsaelsdottir, Solrun Sumarlidadottir and Maria Huld Markan Sigfusdottir initially got together in 2004 as a string quartet but soon packed up every instrument they could find and retreated to an isolated mountaintop studio.

The photograph misdirects us. We become angry at Harman, rather than angry at the killer. We see al-Jamadi's body, but we don't see the act that turned him from a human being into a corpse. We don't understand what the photograph means, nor what it is about."
2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"LONDON -- With Internet gambling predicted to surpass $20 billion in 2008, and with illegal wagering accounting for $150 billion in the United States, by some estimates, the temptation for those seeking to influence the outcome of games has never been greater. Now, a raft of gambling scandals in sports, from cricket to soccer and most recently tennis, has raised an uncomfortable question: Are the games we watch fixed? Last Monday, a report commissioned by the major tennis governing bodies recommended that 45 matches played in the last five years be investigated because betting patterns gave a ''strong indication'' that gamblers were profiting from inside information. And those matches, the report said, may be only the tip of the iceberg."

Longtime Coordinator of Amnesty International Group 9 (West Village), Bill worked tirelessly for human rights and against the death penalty. Honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 1947, he was an NAACP member and civil rights activist since college (U. of Conn., BA, 1950). His management consulting firm, W.K. Williams & Co., specialized in non-profits and government. But he was happiest leading a mushroom walk along the Pallisades for the NY Mycological Society; he edited its newsletter, as well as ''Toxic And Hallucinogenic Mushroom Poisoning'' by mycologist Gary Lincoff and D.H. Mitchel, M.D. Eternally curious, he studied at the Jung Institute, Switzerland. A dedicated Village Democrat, he regularly volunteered at a Village homeless shelter. He'd wrinkle his nose, reading this, as his self-deprecating wit was as quick as his wisdom and humility were great. He'll be missed forever by the love of his life, his wife Helen; sister Rhoda; nephew Alan; niece Andrea; grandniece Alexis; and hundreds of friends who knew his unconditional love.

Getting through a traffic jam on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is a game of inches. So even though I'm a fan of almost anything with a motor and two wheels, I was a bit skeptical about venturing onto city streets aboard a Vespa. After touring through Manhattan and Brooklyn on a group ride for journalists on a recent Saturday, though, I discovered that scooters are extremely useful for basic city transport."

2008-05-25T00:00:00Z,"BRADLEY--Barbara Louise . (December 12, 1927--May 2, 2008). Recognized as one of the greatest and most inspiring teachers of drawing in the country, Barbara Bradley died May 2, 2008 in California following an automobile accident. She was an awardwinning illustrator, instructor, painter, and author, as well as a loving wife, daughter, mother and grandmother. She was Director of the School of Illustration at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco for twenty-five years, and was the only Academy teacher to have a hall named after her (Bradley Hall, 540 Powell Street, San Francisco). She was one of a handful of successful females in a male-dominated profession, although she didn't consider herself a pioneer; she merely did what she loved to do. Barbara was the only child of Gerard and Josie Preston. She was born in Los Angeles, but spent most of her childhood in San Francisco. Barbara graduated from Lowell High School in San Francisco, then attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she met her first husband Herbert Briggs (a fellow artist) while drawing for the rally committee. Herb and Barbara studied at Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles before setting off for New York to begin their careers. Barbara was soon hired to work at the prestigious Charles E. Cooper Studio in New York City, where she achieved great success. After returning to California, Barbara continued her career as a freelance illustrator. Specializing in figure drawing, she became best known for her depictions of children (while raising three of her own, all of whom did their stints as models for her). Her work for such clients as Bank of America, Borden, Dole, PG&E, and C&H Sugar brought her many awards. In 1958, Barbara was invited to speak at the Academy of Art in San Francisco. She was thereupon invited to teach, and was ultimately encouraged by Academy thenpresident Richard Stephens to build, class-by-class, what would become the School of Illustration as it is today at the Academy of Art University. Over the next five decades, Barbara inspired generations of students to become professional appreciators of story, figure, gesture, character, and costume; to love color, value, and composition; and to become lifetime learners. Always attired in one of her paisley smocks, Barbara continued to teach drawing until last December, when she formally retired at the age of 80. Barbara also taught drawing classes and workshops at many locations throughout the United States and London, including Disney Animation Studios, Pixar and Lucas Arts. Her work is displayed in the Museum of American Illustration at the Society of Illustrators in New York and in the permanent collection of the US Air Force. Encouraged by her second husband Neil in 2003, Bradley published the longanticipated Drawing People: How to Portray the Clothed Figure (NorthLight Books). Known as a ''must have book for any artist'', one reviewer noted that ''the information is better than any class I have taken or book I have read. It is not a book just on technique, but it teaches how to see the object. Barbara Bradley shares a road map...every artist should have this book.'' Last year, Bradley received the coveted Distinguished Educator Award from the Society of Illustrators in NY. She was selected by a jury of 75 esteemed illustrators and artists from all over the world, joining a prestigious list of previous winners. This was the capstone to her career; she had also received numerous vocational and teaching awards, and in 1992 was awarded Honorary Life Membership In the San Francisco Society Of Illustrators. Barbara always said that she had two families. Her ''first family'' included her husband, Neil, who passed away on May 4, 2008 due to injuries suffered in the same automobile accident, and her survivors: children Lauchlin Briggs Divine, Glennis Briggs, Andy Bradley and his wife Bella; and grandchildren Diana Divine and Lydia Bradley. Her son-in-law Craig Divine died in 2006. Her ''second family'' included the hundreds of students who she taught and from whom she learned. Today, those students can be found as close as San Francisco and as far away as Shanghai. Though Barbara would say that all of her students were notable, some who have earned national or international recognition include Kazuhiko Sano, Francis Livingston, Zahid Sardar, Robert Hunt, Tim Bower, Chuck Pyle, Bob Walker, Lisa Berrett and Melissa Marshall. Many former Bradley students were inspired to become teachers. A long-time resident of Berkeley, California, Barbara wrote that she was happy about the choices she'd made during her life, including ''choosing to raise a family rather than being a full-time illustrator, choosing to make my kids' clothes and fancy birthday cakes rather than spending time 'on the board', and eventually choosing to become more involved in teaching illustration than in the doing of it.'' When she celebrated 50 years of teaching at the Academy last December, also commemorating her 80th birthday and her sixdecade career, she said it was ''a wonderful event that made my choices not only inevitable but the right ones.'' The fire that Barbara's passion and enthusiasm has kindled in the hearts of artists the world over continues to burn, and will certainly be passed on for many generations to come. Memorial Service for Barbara Bradley, 2151 Van Ness Avenue at Broadway, Academy of Art University Chapel (Formerly St. Brigids Church), San Francisco, California, Thursday, June 5, 2008, 7 o'clock pm."

2008-05-26T00:00:00Z,"O'BRIEN--Fr. Frederick J., S.J., died on Monday, May 19, 2008, at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Hollywood, California. He was 76 years of age. He had been a member of the Society of Jesus for 58 years and a priest for 46 years. Father O'Brien was born in Hyde Park, MA on October 31, 1931, and was baptized at Most Precious Blood Church in the Archdiocese of Boston. He attended Boston College High School from 1945 to 1949 and entered the Society of Jesus on July 30, 1949 at Shadowbrook in Lenox, MA, where he also did his first studies as a Jesuit. He received his theological training in preparation for priesthood at Woodstock College in Woodstock, MD, and was ordained a priest there on June 17, 1962. Father O'Brien held a Master's Degree in History from the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, but achieving that degree did not put an end to his continuous study of history and his keen sense for historical detail which frequently informed his conversation. He taught history at Boston College from 1968 to 1971 and at Fairfield University from 1971 to 1976. In 1976 Father O'Brien's career took him from Jesuit universities into Jesuit high schools. Although he was always a Bostonian at heart, it was at this time that Father O'Brien moved to New York City. There he began to teach history at Regis High School in Manhattan, but almost immediately he moved into high school administrative positions at Regis High School and then at Fordham Preparatory in the Bronx. He returned to New England to be Principal and later to be both Principal and President at Bishop Connolly High School in Fall River, only to return again to the Big Apple to assume the office of Principal at Regis High School from 1983 to 1989. Father O'Brien became Assistant to the New York Provincial for Secondary Education from 1990 to 2001. Having finished his career in secondary education, Father O'Brien indulged his interest in history by becoming the New York Province Archivist. Fluent in English, Spanish and German, Father O'Brien helped manage many of the international correspondences from the Provincial's office. In addition, Father O'Brien wrote the obituaries of deceased Jesuits for various publications. Father O'Brien fulfilled these duties until he died. Besides having been a scholar, an administrator and a historian, Father O'Brien was a devoted priest. He spent several weeks each year on the west coast providing pastoral care in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, especially at Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood, CA. It was during his last visit to the west coast that Father O'Brien fell ill, received hospitalization, and died. Father O'Brien is survived by his cousins Richard O'Brien of Humarock, MA, Patricia O'Brien of West Roxbury, MA, and Robert O'Brien of Washington Depot, CT. Friends may call Monday May 26th, 2-4 and 7-9pm and Tuesday May 27th, 2-4pm at Regis High School Chapel, 55 East 84th Street, NY.

That finally changed on Monday after Mattingly, a special assignment coach with the Los Angeles Dodgers, saw the famous ivy on the outfield walls and heard the Bleacher Bums. ""My mom always wanted me to play here,"" Mattingly said. ""It was day baseball. It was five hours from my home. You were close enough so that you could get home, but not so close that you would have people bothering you all the time."" When Mattingly, who played his entire career with the Yankees, was asked if he ever came close to playing for the Chicago Cubs, he said that he had not. Then Mattingly laughed and added, ""Well, not that I know of."" As Mattingly and Manager Joe Torre drove to Wrigley on Monday, he told Torre that he had never seen the Friendly Confines. The Yankees played here in 2003, but Mattingly, who lives in Evansville, Ind., did not became a Yankees coach until 2004. Mattingly was supposed to be the Dodgers' batting coach, but he assumed a lesser role so he could be home with Jordon, his youngest son. Mattingly and his wife, Kim, filed for divorce last November. Jordon is in high school. Although Joe Girardi beat out Mattingly for the Yankees' manager position, Mattingly said he still wanted to manage. Mattingly said he would renew his quest once his family situation was stabilized. He will not travel to Shea Stadium with the Dodgers for the series starting Thursday because he is taking Jordon to compete in a horse jumping show."

2008-05-27T00:00:00Z,"TORNBERG--Edwin 82, owner of an East Coast Broadcasting Co., passed away May 23rd at his home in Potomac, MD after a long illness. He was Chairman of New World Radio Group, which owns and operates radio stations including WUST Washington and WNWR Philadelphia. Mr. Tornberg started in business brokerage and consulting in 1954. In 1957, Mr. Tornberg formed Edwin Tornberg and Co., Inc. specializing in brokerage, consulting and appraisal work for the banking, broadcasting and cable TV industries. His firm was based in NYC for 17 years, later moving to Washington. Illustrative clients included Bankers Trust, Bank of New York, Century Communications, Broadband Communications, New York Times Company, Nationwide Communications, Heftel Broadcasting Corp. and Wrather Corp., among others. Mr. Tornberg was in telecommunications since 1960. In addition to the stations he operated at the time of his death, he previously owned radio stations in Virginia, California, Kentucky, Oregon and Indiana and cable TV systems throughout the Western U.S. They were sold to Telecommunications, Inc. (NASD). Mr. Tornberg was regarded as something of a pioneer in the Washington radio-TV market as he went against conventional wisdom in 1992 by founding Washington's first exclusively multicultural broadcast station, WUST. The station broadcasts programs, many locally-originated, in as many as a dozen different languages to serve the needs of the Washington area's diverse population of diplomats, international civil servants and immigrants. After the success of WUST, Mr. Tornberg brought the concept to Philadelphia three years later with the purchase of WNWR, a 50,000 watt outlet which he converted to multilingual broadcasting. Mr. Tornberg recently retired as a director of Citizen's Communications Co., Stamford, CT, a NYSE-listed company. Edwin Joshua Tornberg was born in Plainfield, NJ and grew up in New Jersey and New York. He attended Stevens Institute of Technology and served in the US Army. He was a member of various broadcasting associations. Survivors include his wife Ina, of Potomac and Stuart, FL, son Donald (Sandy), brother Ralph, grandson Jayson, granddaughters, Alyssa and Samantha, stepsons Alan Hahn (Joan), Ronald Smith, Martin Smith (Linda), and Lawrence Smith (Lori), stepdaughter Alexandra Chesterton (David), five step-grandchildren and two step-greatgrandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife Chi-Chi, his first wife Shirley from whom he was divorced and their son Gary (Sharyn Tornberg Gold)."

The building, dubbed the Signal Tower, is part of an ambitious plan to revitalize La Défense that was conceived in 2006 when Nicolas Sarkozy, who is now France’s president, led a public body dedicated to that goal. Patrick Devedjian, who succeeded him, said the tower would be the “most important architectural act since the Eiffel Tower.” Comprising four segments that resemble stacked cubes, the tower will have apartments on the upper floors, as well as a hotel, offices and a business plaza. (Above, an artist’s rendering of an interior view, and, right, of the tower, shown with the Grande Arche.) It is to be completed by 2015. Mr. Nouvel, who captured the Pritzker Prize, architecture’s top honor, this year, also designed the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, which opened in 2006, and is at work on a satellite of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates."

An open letter signed by Ms. Blanchett, who, with her husband, the playwright Andrew Upton, is a joint artistic director of the Sydney Theater Company, declared that the potential prosecution “does untold damage to our cultural reputation.” The signers included Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, and the writer Larissa Behrendt. Last week, responding to a complaint from a member of the public, the police raided and closed the Henson exhibition at the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney and seized 20 works. They said they were likely to bring charges in connection with the images, described by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as “absolutely revolting.” All the signers of the protest letter took part last month in Canberra in Mr. Rudd’s national summit on future directions. The letter said that Mr. Henson’s “work itself is not pornographic, even though it includes depictions of naked human beings. It is more justly seen in a tradition of the nude in art that stretches back to the ancient Greeks, and which includes painters such as Caravaggio and Michelangelo.”."

Inside, at eye level, is a gap filled by a television screen that shows the kissing men, above. Bernd Neumann, Germany’s minister of culture, evoked the present when he said the monument was “also first and foremost an expression of our conviction that in our country there is no place for the discrimination of homosexuals, of people who think and live differently.” On hand for the unveiling was Berlin’s openly gay mayor, Klaus Wowereit, but no survivors.

Inside, at eye level, is a gap filled by a television screen that shows the kissing men, above. Bernd Neumann, Germany's minister of culture, evoked the present when he said the monument was ''also first and foremost an expression of our conviction that in our country there is no place for the discrimination of homosexuals, of people who think and live differently.'' On hand for the unveiling was Berlin's openly gay mayor, Klaus Wowereit, but no survivors. The last known survivor, Pierre Seel, died in November 2005. Homosexuality was illegal in Germany until 1969 and not formally decriminalized until 1994."

2008-05-28T00:00:00Z,"The French architectJean Nouvel has been selected to design a high-rise building that will strikingly alter the skyline in La Défense business district on the outskirts of Paris, officials announced on Tuesday. His project was chosen from among those of five finalists, among them Norman Foster and Daniel Libeskind. The building, dubbed the Signal Tower, is part of an ambitious plan to revitalize La Défense that was conceived in 2006 when Nicolas Sarkozy, who is now France's president, led a public body dedicated to that goal. Patrick Devedjian, who succeeded him, said the tower would be the ''most important architectural act since the Eiffel Tower.'' Comprising four segments that resemble stacked cubes, the tower will have apartments on the upper floors, as well as a hotel, offices and a business plaza. (Above, an artist's rendering of an interior view, and, right, of the tower, shown with the Grande Arche.) It is to be completed by 2015. Mr. Nouvel, who captured the Pritzker Prize, architecture's top honor, this year, also designed the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, which opened in 2006, and is at work on a satellite of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates."
2008-05-28T00:00:00Z,"Cate Blanchett joined forces on Tuesday with prominent people in the arts to protest plans by the police to initiate an obscenity prosecution over images by Bill Henson, an eminent photographer, that feature nude 12- and 13-year-olds, Agence France-Presse reported. An open letter signed by Ms. Blanchett, who, with her husband, the playwright Andrew Upton, is a joint artistic director of the Sydney Theater Company, declared that the potential prosecution ''does untold damage to our cultural reputation.'' The signers included Elizabeth Ann Macgregor, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, and the writer Larissa Behrendt. Last week, responding to a complaint from a member of the public, the police raided and closed the Henson exhibition at the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery in Sydney and seized 20 works. They said they were likely to bring charges in connection with the images, described by Prime MinisterKevin Rudd as ''absolutely revolting.'' All the signers of the protest letter took part last month in Canberra in Mr. Rudd's national summit on future directions. The letter said that Mr. Henson's ''work itself is not pornographic, even though it includes depictions of naked human beings. It is more justly seen in a tradition of the nude in art that stretches back to the ancient Greeks, and which includes painters such as Caravaggio and Michelangelo.''"

2008-05-29T00:00:00Z,"POLLACK--Sydney. The Film Foundation joins the entertainment community in mourning the loss of Sydney Pollack. Mr. Pollack was a founding member of the board of directors of the foundation and was actively involved in its preservation and artists rights programs. ''Sydney was a leading light in the effort to protect and preserve film. He cared passionately about every aspect of the creative process and his love of movies and the people who make them was evident in his work as a director, a producer, and an actor. He will be sorely missed,'' said foundation chair, Martin Scorsese. Mr. Pollack joined Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg in creating The Film Foundation in 1990 to address the issue of film preservation. He remained deeply involved in the foundation's work, helping to advocate for preservation and filmmakers' rights. In 2000, Mr. Pollack received the ''John Huston Award for Artists Rights'' for his advocacy, including his 1987 testimony before a Senate Judiciary Committee against the alteration of motion pictures without the director's consent. An excerpt from Mr. Pollack's statement highlights his commitment: ''...Films are part of our cultural history. Like all accurate representations of who and what we were, they deserve preservation in their authentic form. Like a building, a photograph, or a document it helps locate us in time and gives us a sense of the geography of our lives. We need an accurate understanding of the past in order to point us accurately toward the future.'' The Film Foundation expresses its condolences to Mr. Pollack's family."

Sole survivor of a family of twelve, Eta escaped deportation and a Nazi prison before becoming commander of a Jewish partisan group in the forests around her home town, Lukow, Poland. She began life anew in Brooklyn with devotion to family, Holocaust remembrance and support for Israel. Our condolences to her family. WROBEL--Eta. The Board of Directors and staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research mourn the passing of our dear friend, Eta Wrobel. As a Jewish partisan fighter in Nazi-occupied Poland, she showed remarkable courage and strength, carrying these qualities with her into her new life in America. Her dedication to YIVO, yidishkayt, Holocaust remembrance, and Israel was truly exemplary. Founding Chair of YIVO's International Women's Committee, she helped keep historical memory alive. Our profound condolences to her husband Henry and extended family. She will be sorely missed. May her memory be for a blessing. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Carl Rheins, Exec. Director"

2008-05-29T00:00:00Z,"INTERNATIONAL OLMERT AIMS TO STAY IN PLACE Despite Call for Resignation More straws landed upon the back of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel as Ehud Barak, the Minister of Defense called for him to step down pending the outcome of his corruption inquest. Mr. Olmert refused, saying that he did not believe that he should step down simply because of an investigation. An official close to him said that Mr. Olmert did not want the political machine to trump the legal one, and believed it would become clear during the inquest that he had done nothing wrong. Page A10 THE GERMAN MILK PARTY? The Federation of European Dairy Farmers estimates that, on Wednesday alone, 10.6 million gallons of milk were dumped in a boycott by European dairy farmers. Why? While food prices have soared, the price of milk has not, in part because the European Union has raised quotas but not prices. As the price of milk fell, prices of fuel and feed rose. But cows keep producing and will sicken if not milked, so dairy farmers will keep working, and dumping, as long as the boycott lasts. Page A6 THE LAST DAYS OF NEPAL'S MONARCHY Nepal's 239-year-long monarchy neared its end, as a newly elected assembly told Gyanendra, king of Nepal, to step down from his throne in 15 days. The assembly is led by former Maoist guerrillas who emerged from the jungle after 10 years of war and traded gunplay for politics. They also demanded an end to the monarchy. Winning more than a third of Parliament's 601 seats, they hold a majority position and the party's leader is expected to take over as prime minister. Those suspected of remaining loyal to the monarchy have spoken by detonating small bombs in Katmandu. Page A8 SOUTH AFRICA WEIGHS SHELTER PLAN Waves of xenophobic violence have been visited against immigrants in South Africa, leading them to flee the impoverished squatter areas they had been living in. Relief organizations have proposed shelters intended as a temporary solution that could house as many as 70,000, but have been delayed pending a government decision. Doubts have been raised about South Africa's ability to run them, and international agencies fear that the camps could become rife with conflicts and sexual violence. Page A12 NATIONAL A PARTIAL PICTURE Of Carbon Footprints A new study by the Brookings Institution rating energy use showed, in general, smaller carbon footprints for the West Coast, with the Honolulu area ranked No. 1 followed by the area including Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, the Portland-Vancouver area in the Northwest and the New York metropolitan area. At the bottom: a cluster of rust-belt urban areas including Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Lexington, Ky.; and Toledo, Ohio. PAGE A21 A PLAN FOR THE OCEANS With numerous projects being proposed for the waters off its shores, Massachusetts is now the first state to have a framework for a protection plan for its ocean waters. It sets ground rules for all offshore projects and businesses, including energy ventures and conservation areas that lie within three miles of the coast. PAGE A15 FINDING THE TABLES TURNED As President Bush's press secretary, Scott McClellan was part of the apparatus used by the White House to take on Mr. Bush's critics. Having departed that job, and with a new book that now casts him as one of those critics, Mr. McClellan is learning that the apparatus still functions without him. PAGE A14 CARE FOR THOSE WHO GIVE CARE The Army has begun to recognize that the war in Iraq is taking a toll not only on the troops, but also on those who counsel those troops, the chaplains. None have been killed, but some have been wounded, some in ways that cannot be seen. ''I've been really pushed to my limits and beyond,'' one said. ''At times, I've really wondered if I could get through.'' PAGE A19 SECT MOTHERS SPEAK OUT As the highest court in Texas prepares to rule on whether child welfare authorities had the right to take 468 children from a ranch early last month, the mothers are trying to make their case with the public by speaking out more forcefully about the harm they think the separation has already done to their children. PAGE A14 BUSINESS WITH FURTHER MERGERS UNLIKELY, Airlines Face Making Own Cuts Mergers other than the already-announced deal between Delta and Northwest seem unlikely, so airlines seeking to offset rising fuel prices are likely to cut costs, cut routes and park planes without the camouflage that a merger would have provided. And that means that the grumbling will come through unfiltered. PAGE C1 EXXON CHALLENGE DEFEATED Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, defeated a shareholder effort supported by many members of the Rockefeller family that would have divided the chairman and chief executive positions. The vote was at an annual meeting punctuated by a debate of the company's policy toward renewable energy and global warming and, though nonbinding, would have been a serious rebuke. PAGE C3 NATURAL GAS RISING LIKE GASOLINE A longstanding assumption of American energy policy -- that natural gas will be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America -- is being challenged as the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead. PAGE C1 LIFE VALUES IN THE CORPORATE WORLD Students who join Stewart Friedman's management class at the Wharton business school commit to sharing intimate details with their classmates about their most important relationships. And though that may not sound like the stuff of business school education, Mr. Friedman and others have tapped into a desire by both students and established entrepreneurs for more integration of their careers and personal lives. PAGE C5 Strength in Durable Goods econ C4 METRO EXERCISER'S LOUD NOISES Lead to Assault Trial Stuart Sugarman adjusted the stationary bicycle for his frame, clicked his specialty cycling shoes into the pedals and, when spinning class started, began the most conspicuous part of his ritual: his loud noises. Christopher Carter, who was two bikes down, took issue with the noises. Now a trial in Manhattan Criminal Court is to determine whether what Mr. Carter did to stop Mr. Sugarman from making those noises qualifies as assault. PAGE A25 DEFENDING A PERK Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York says giving members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board free E-ZPasses to drive across its bridges and tunnels without paying tolls, as well as passes to ride the subways, buses and commuter railroads without paying, violates a state law requiring that members serve without compensation. The authority disagrees, and plans to go to court to fight for the perk. PAGE A24 STYLES STILL TURNING A PROFIT In Fashion's Fast Lane One survey this month found more than half the respondents saying they planned to spend less on apparel; another found almost a third of people reporting ''severe anxiety'' about their personal finances. All of which can be good news, it seems, if you happen to be in the fast-fashion business. ''The least vulnerable brands now are the ones at the lower end of the luxury market and the upper end of the midtier market,'' one analyst said. PAGE E1 YOGA FOR THE MASSES The explosion in popularity of yoga has been good news for novices looking for classes -- there is seemingly one on every corner, and maybe another upstairs. But for the advanced student looking for something a little -- or a lot -- more challenging, the result is not so good. In seeking to be accessible to the many, classes become less desirable for the few. PAGE E10 FEEL THE STRETCH, AVOID THE MARK Various concoctions are marketing as being able to prevent stretch marks resulting from pregnancy. Can they? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says no. But the American Pregnancy Association suggests that women can reduce the probability of stretch marks (the key word being ''probability''). But be aware that genetics and race play a role in stretch marks, too. skin PAGE E3 NO ORDINARY JOE This sort of thing used to be reserved for wines, but beers have gotten into the act, along with single malt scotches. And so it follows that coffee tastings -- known to aficionados as cuppings -- now appear, at which the devoted might pay $20 each to taste three coffees, each from a different country. Take along a sophisticated palate if you want to pick up the hints of basil and jasmine. PAGE E6 SPORTS AT 17, READY TO RUN Against Sport's Elite Chanelle Price is a high school senior with some typical items on her to-do list this time of year: finish writing two papers, take two final exams. She also has one most unusual item: run the 800 meters at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., on June 8. From there, who knows, maybe the Olympics in Beijing. PAGE C12 WHEN IT WENT TO THE WIRE The occasion of this year's run at horse racing's Triple Crown cannot help calling forth memories of the last one, 30 years ago, when two outstanding horses not only faced off in each of the three races but also finished 1-2 in each of them. ''Seen through the current prism of fragile, transient champions, Affirmed and Alydar seem from another planet, another age, another breed,'' George Vecsey writes in Sports of The Times. PAGE C14 HOME FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE To That Chlorine Smell For those who want -- or have -- a swimming pool, but do not want the smell and possible other side effects of a chlorine sanitation system, other options exist. Pool installers may not tell you about them, and they are not cheap, but for some people they are a must. ''Our target audience is the person who shops at Whole Foods,'' said one installer. PAGE F1 PUTTING DOWN (SHALLOW) ROOTS Move often enough, Peter Moore says, and ''you realize quickly how you are burdened by your past, and so you become a ruthless editor.'' And Mr. Moore, an architect and developer, and his wife, Kathryn Lynch, a painter, have moved often enough. But they've been in the same place for three years now: the top floor of an 1890s brick warehouse on Washington Street. ''Our semipermanent home,'' he calls it. PAGE F5 Shopping for Newlyweds F4 OBITUARIES DAVID GAHR, 85 He turned his back on a promising career as a scholar to take pictures and listen to music and as a result landed among the pre-eminent photographers of American folk, blues, jazz and rock musicians of the 1960s and beyond. PAGE C11 SOPHIE B. ALTMAN, 95 In 1961 she started a television quiz show for precocious high school students, later added pep bands and cheerleaders and was as surprised as anybody when the show, ''It's Academic,'' became the world's longest-running quiz show. PAGE C11 ARTS ABC IN ANCHOR TALKS With Charles Gibson ABC passed over Charles Gibson in 2005 as anchor of ''World News,'' but events put him in the job anyway, success followed, and now he is in talks to stay there for the foreseeable future. Does he want to? ''I honestly don't know,'' he says. One person who must be anxiously waiting the outcome is Diane Sawyer, whose future probably is linked to the result. PAGE B1 AN ETHICS DISCLAIMER The media reporter (and sometimes ethics arbiter) Howard Kurtz invited Kimberly Dozier, the CBS journalist wounded in Iraq, onto his program on CNN on Sunday to talk about her memoir, ''Breathing the Fire.'' After the interview, he revealed that his wife had ''done some promotion work'' for the book. He and his employers see no problem with that. Some media ethicists do. PAGE B3 'LOST' LEADING THE LOST Even committed viewers of the ABC series ''Lost'' might be forgiven for not being able to follow every twist of its anarchic plot or not being aware of the relevance -- even the existence -- of the many obscure allusions made. And anyone who has looked even briefly at ''Lost'' blogs knows that some people are trying way too hard. Season Four concludes tonight. PAGE B1 Gliding Through Space B5 EDITORIAL IN DEFENSE OF WORKERS The Supreme Court upheld the rights of employees who charge age and race discrimination. Perhaps the justices realized that Americans want a court that does not stack the deck for the powerful. Or, they may simply be getting better at respecting precedent. PAGE A26 I KNEW IT ALL ALONG A new memoir by President Bush's former press secretary, Scott McClellan, could be named: ''I Knew It Was a Terrible Mistake, but I Didn't Mention It Until I Got a Book Contract.'' PAGE A26 NEW JERSEY PRIMARY CHOICES The Editorial Board endorses Frank Lautenberg for the Democratic Senate primary and former Representative Richard Zimmer for the Republican race. Republicans should pick Leonard Lance for the Seventh Congressional District. PAGE A26 OP-ED NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF Does Islamic terrorism threaten this year's Olympic Games? The Chinese authorities have warned of terror plots emanating from the mostly Muslim region of Xinjiang. On a trip to the ancient Silk Road oasis of Kashgar, signs abound of the authorities' anxiety about stability in China's Muslim west. PAGE A27 GAIL COLLINS South Dakota, along with Montana, is going to have the Last Primary on Tuesday. When you live in a reliably red state with only three electoral votes and no real fund-raising potential, it takes being overlooked in the presidential races to a whole new level.

And a cooler rider is one who can concentrate on the trail, said Ned Overend, a former professional mountain biker and an author of ''Mountain Bike Like a Champion.''

The letter writer declares himself to be ""outraged"" because, in his view, ""Autistic spectrum disorders are not diseases, but rather markers of 'genetic difference' in the same vein as skin color [and] gender."" He equates the search for a cure with genocide - it's ""part of a campaign to wipe out ASDs"" [autism spectrum disorder] - and he wants the world to know that those to whom the cure would be offered neither need it nor desire it: ""I speak for many when I say we are happy the way we are.""A genetic difference is often adaptive and can be regarded as an advance in the evolutionary process; it is well-known that autism sometimes brings with it remarkable powers in the areas of music, art and mathematics. In the 2006 movie ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" the augmented powers of those known as ""mutants"" are even more remarkable and include the ability to walk through walls, to move metal objects as large as California's Golden Gate Bridge, to auto-generate fire or ice, to be in seven places at the same time, to read minds, to assume any identity, to kill with a touch, to fly like Icarus, to change the weather. These abilities are seen by many ""normal"" human beings, and a few mutants, as disabilities, as an indication that the person who possesses one of them is a freak."

The Yankees went on to win, 6-5, and clinch the series, and afterward Rincon, a Venezuelan whose English wasn't the greatest, said, ""Nobody wants to be in my pants right now.""This morning's news: With the bullpen overworked the last few days, the Yankees summoned Scott Patterson from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and designated Morgan Ensberg for assignment. Ensberg got the news shortly after he arrived at the Metrodome this morning, and was back out the door within minutes.

Close, US Air Force, Retired, died in Bluffton, South Carolina, May 23, 2008 after 90 years of service to his Country and devotion to his family. A command pilot with more than 7000 flying hours to his credit, General Close was born in Columbus, Ohio and raised in New York City and Los Angeles. This graduate of Beverly Hills High School and Stanford University joined the Army Air Corps in 1939, earned his wings and commission at Kelly Field, Texas, and subsequently went on to a distinguished military career which included flying ''the hump'' in the China-Burma-India theater as a B-29 squadron commander and leading B-29s out of the Mariana Islands as a group operations officer in 1945. General Close returned from World War II after 600 combat hours and 35 missions. In 1952 he commanded the 98th Bomb Wing at Yokota Air Base, Japan where he flew 21 more combat missions over Korea. During the Cold War the General played an integral role in the Strategic Air Command and Operation Looking Glass. His career culminated with his command of JT2 at Sandia Base, New Mexico, working directly under the Joint Chiefs. The General retired in 1968, and moved with his wife, the former Joan Millsop of Weirton, West Virginia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where this former college polo and tennis player found time to express his athleticism as a Champion golfer. General Close was preceded in death by his wife of 55 years in 1998. He is survived by his four daughters: Leslie Joan Close of Bellevale, NY; Christine Campbell of Colorado Springs; Joey Close Baffico of Montclair, NJ; Barbara Vote of Hillsboro, Oregon; and, five grandchildren.

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"At the Coachella festival in April the set by M.I.A., in one of the festival's bigger tents, was packed. Really packed. Hanging from the rafters packed, nearly unsafe packed. Her gig at McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn on Friday, the opening concert of the summer concert series there, is looking as if it could be one of the New York shows of the year. No doubt it will be uncomfortably packed too. But this is suitable: M.I.A.'s records and her show imitate the chaos and density of a busy city street -- some sort of multipurpose intersection with a thousand signs, signals, smells and sounds. They're like bad cellphone connections to carnival chants and truck sirens, low-grade video uplinks from Sri Lanka to London to Trinidad to Mozambique. It's meant to be clashing and confusing and provocative.

Keith taught economics at Columbia and NYU and worked in the advisory groups of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., JP Morgan and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. He ''retired'' in 1996, the better to pursue more theoretical interests in mathematics/econometrics and an equivalent passion for apartment/house remodeling and electric system design applied, in a tradition passed down from his father, for the benefit of family and friends. Keith was a remarkable individual, smart and compassionate well beyond the ordinary. He impacted many lives. He loved, he was loved and he will be missed.

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The golf-course architect Robert Trent Jones Jr. uses the phrase ''shock and awesome'' to describe one of his latest creations, Chambers Bay, the much-ballyhooed municipal course on a stretch of windswept Puget Sound coastline outside Tacoma, Wash. And while the 68-year-old architect is surely a little biased, I'm not so quick to dismiss his boast as promotional pap. Given Jones's résumé as a designer (more than 240 courses and counting) and his bloodlines (his late father, Robert, was a highly acclaimed golf-course architect, as is his brother, Rees), you'd have to assume the man would know when he has nailed it. Though Chambers Bay is barely a year old, the United States Golf Association has tapped it to host the 2015 U.S. Open, making it just the third public golf course (after Bethpage Black and this year's site, Torrey Pines) ever selected to host an Open. That helps ease the sting of the steep-for-a-muni cost to play ($170 a round for nonresidents on summer weekends). Built atop an old sand-and-gravel quarry, Chambers is a barren, links-style layout pimpled with dunes and mounds; it's so true to the British Isles that if not for the snow-capped Olympic Mountains looming in the background, you'd swear you were hacking around Scotland or Ireland. Only one tree, a lone fir, was left standing on the course -- and for that reprieve, it can thank the bald eagle that chose to nest there. (The tree can also thank the Audubon Society, which certified the course as a Silver Signature Sanctuary, making it the first golf course in the Pacific Northwest to earn such bird-friendly status.)"

''It was easy,'' she said of the process. ''I love everything I do, but I just picked the most stylish ones.'' Needless to say, the book has heft. ''Babeth'' by Babeth Djian"

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Not so long ago, even rank amateurs pretended to be sound engineers when listening to jazz or Journey. Just like a real audiophile, you furrowed your brow over graphic equalizers and studied up on reference speakers and multi-CD changers. If your life was going to include a party or seduction, you needed a stereo -- and your choice of equipment made a statement. Then the iPod and iTunes changed that; for all but the fanatics, they took the art out of playing music in the car or at home. And then came that unromantic iPod dock: no longer did your choice of Harman/Kardon or a scuffed boombox say anything about you except that that you were lugging around some antiquated junk. What a comedown. The old rarefied knowledge -- and finesse with the levers and knobs and high-stacked component systems -- suddenly seemed worthless. But not so fast! Just as I was hanging it up as an aspiring stereo expert, I perceived a new skill set taking shape, one that eclipsed my old sound geekery. Graphic design! Sure, I can't write any actual code or even do much with HTML, but the finish work on my technology now consumes days. I customize everything with colors and fonts and photos and choices of backgrounds, wallpaper, screen savers. It's like decorating my 10th-grade notebook with stickers of Rossignol and Vuarnet logos, as well as cryptic verse from Edie Brickell -- all meant to suggest both a rich interior life and an intimacy with high-end brands."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"A famous Italian filmmaker befriends a maker of wedding videos on a beach in Sicily. Then, smitten with the subject of the wedding director's next and most important job -- the nuptials of the daughter of a local prince -- he muscles the hapless videographer aside and takes on the project himself. That may sound like more than enough infrastructure for a darkly humorous farce, but ''THE WEDDING DIRECTOR'' (2006) is the work of the ageless Italian provocateur Marco Bellocchio, so the complications just keep piling up. The filmmaker-hero (Sergio Castellitto) is also working on an adaptation of Manzoni's classic 19th-century novel of love, honor and delayed marriage, ''The Betrothed.'' The prince's daughter (Donatella Finocchiaro) tries to audition for the film, but leaves after an assistant recommends that she begin by giving the director oral sex -- ''literally or figuratively,'' he says, either is fine, as long as it's done ''with style.'' In a nod to Mr. Bellocchio's 1960s New Wave roots, the prince is played by the veteran French actor Sami Frey, star of Jean-Luc Godard's ''Bande à Part.''

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"The can-do looks of Mary McCormack (''The West Wing,'' ''ER,'' ''K Street'') make her unusually well cast as a federal marshal in the new series ''IN PLAIN SIGHT,'' which makes its debut Sunday at 10 p.m. on the USA Network. She appears to be the sort of person who can take care of business, and as Mary Shannon in this new drama about the witness protection program, that's exactly what she does: playing real estate agent, friend, chamber of commerce, nanny, shrink and bodyguard to underground criminals and those with the poor timing to have happened on a crime when they surely should have been playing bingo. Mary's job is to keep these unfortunates alive and listen to their sad-sack stories, and it's unclear which is harder. Like ''Burn Notice,'' USA's other escapade in hiding out, ''In Plain Sight'' maintains a light touch. ''THE MOLE,'' the reality series that returns to ABC Monday at 10 p.m., takes itself more seriously. The guiding principle, however, is the same: Trust no one. Grown men and women are sent on a mission that a saboteur among them is trying to thwart, while Americans everywhere try to identify the mole because, well, ''Idol'' is over."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"GAZING AT THE KUANG SI WATERFALLS, MARCH 1, 2008 Darrell McDowall, 61, a retired cattle rancher from Byron Bay, Australia, on an exploratory hike just outside Luang Prabang. ''On this trip, I was definitely going from one stage of life to another and dealing with morals and the truth about what love is. And I was being very monkish -- I wasn't drinking and I wasn't packing anything other than my daily bread. I went to Cambodia and up through Laos, up the Mekong and then across to Thailand, and back to my old wat where I was a Buddhist monk in Thailand in the 70s. I was a Vietnam vet so I was always searching for something else after Vietnam, and I had gone into this Buddhist wat. You have to do the Vipassana meditation to become a monk, so I had shaved my head and my eyebrows and we meditated 19 hours a day. I did that for months until the master said 'you're ready,' and then I had to meditate from Monday morning at 4:30 to lunchtime Thursday without sleep. Going back was definitely a spiritual journey for me.'' As told to Austin Considine"

BEHIND THE NEWS The $420 million mission is to investigate Mars's northern polar region, using a 7.7-foot-long robotic arm to dig into the surface and extract dirt and ice. Scientists have been intrigued with the polar region since NASA's orbiting Odyssey spacecraft in 2002 discovered vast quantities of water-ice lying a few inches below the surface. The landing was captured in a picture taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passing overhead. ''An engineer's delight,'' one of the scientists said of the photograph."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Travel is often a means of escape, and this year's travel books offer plenty of it. Failed relationships, dead-end jobs and other disappointments infest the current crop like bedbugs in a youth hostel, driving their authors around the globe in search of transformation. The seekers range from bored young drifters to anxiety-stricken middle-agers, motivated by the quixotic hope that cutting loose will stimulate the mind and heal the soul. ''I was ready for Paris,'' Bryce Corbett announces at the beginning of A TOWN LIKE PARIS: Falling in Love in the City of Light (Broadway, paper, $12.95). ''Ready for a change of scene and the shedding of some emotional baggage.'' After a breakup with a longtime girlfriend, the 28-year-old Australian quits his job at Sky News in London and boards the Eurostar for a new life. What follows is a refreshing variation on a shopworn theme: the Anglophone at large in the French capital, coping with the language barrier, inaccessible Gallic women and bad plumbing. Corbett finds a job he isn't ''qualified for, much less interested in,'' lands a hideously furnished flat in the Marais and joins a circle of partygoing fellow expatriates, whom he annoyingly calls the ''Paris Posse.'' It's not quite ''A Moveable Feast,'' and the tone can be smugly self-satisfied, but Corbett's sharp observations lend the tale a dash of élan. Lamenting the decline of Shakespeare and Company into a Left Bank tourist trap, he notes that its ''literary credibility'' has ''long since been replaced by the distinct aroma of upper-middle-class America -- a mixture of Snapple Ice Tea, sweaty Teva sandals and Tommy Hilfiger cologne.'' When Corbett abandons his quest for a French girlfriend and falls in love with an Australian nightclub entertainer he calls ''the Showgirl,'' you can't help wishing him bonne chance."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"MOLDAW--Stuart G. March 25, 1927-May 24, 2008, a life-long business entrepreneur, philanthropist and friend to a wide range of civic, charitable and political organizations, died Saturday, May 24, 2008 at age 81. Mr. Moldaw, a loving husband, father and grandfather, is survived by his wife Phyllis, daughters Carol and Susan Moldaw, and four grandchildren. His wife and family were able to be with him during his illness and final hours of life. Mr. Moldaw, a pioneer in the specialty retail and clothing business, founded Ross Dress for Less in 1982 and was a founding investor in The Gymboree Corporation in 1986. Ross Stores is a Fortune 500 company with more than 900 locations, and Gymboree is a leading children's clothing and activity brand with 585 stores in the United States and Canada. Mr. Moldaw served as the Chairman of the Board at Ross Stores for more than a decade, and as Chairman Emeritus, he remained an active board member. He also was Chairman Emeritus of The Gymboree Corporation, and cofounded U.S. Venture Partners, a Menlo Park based venture capital firm. Mr. Moldaw started his first company, Country Casuals, in 1958 in Palo Alto, California, and went on to develop a successful retail presence based on a passion for customer service, a belief in distinctive marketing and a drive for competitive pricing. He was known for his foresight into customer preferences and for recognizing and fostering the strengths of his business partners and associates. Mr. Moldaw was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and spent his childhood in Brookline. His father was a Russian immigrant who came to the United States amid his homelands civil war. In 1944, Mr. Moldaw enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was called to active duty aboard a troop transport ship, the Ulysses S. Grant. After the war, he attended Syracuse University on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in Marketing and Economics. While attending Syracuse, he met his future wife, Phyllis Israelson of Portland, Maine. They married in August 1950. Soon after graduating college, he went to work for the Le Bon Marche, a department store in Lowell, Massachusetts, and later G. Fox & Co., a specialty department store in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1955, he moved to California to take a job with Lerner Shops, and he went on to open more than 20 Lerner stores during the late 1950s. Always entrepreneurial, he gave his notice at Lerners in the spring of 1959 and struck out entirely on his own. Beyond his business accomplishments, Mr. Moldaw was a great believer in people and what they could accomplish in life. ''He was an unforgettable man a visionary, entrepreneur, leader and philanthropist,'' said Norman Ferber, chairman of Ross Stores. Mr. Moldaw served on the boards of many San Francisco Bay Area non-profit groups, including the Moldaw-Zaffaroni Boys and Girls Club of East Palo Alto, REDF, Communities in Schools, the Jewish Community Endowment Fund and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The San Francisco Ballet and KQED, and a leading supporter of 899 Charleston, a seniors living center in Palo Alto. In politics, he was a longtime, active Democrat who was appointed by President Clinton as a Public Delegate to the U.S. Mission at the United Nations in 1993 and as Chairman of the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars in 1996. In 2000, Gov. Gray Davis appointed Mr. Moldaw to chair California's World Trade Commission, and two years later to a serve as commissioner on the states Little Hoover Commission. In 2006, Mr. Moldaw captured his personal story in a book titled A Life Story For My Grandchildren. He wrote: ''My greatest happiness came not from money and possessions but from engagements, accomplish ments, challenges, the camaraderie with the people I have met along the way, and the love of my family. I also hope that my grandchildren will come to understand the joy of helping their less fortunate fellows to fulfill their dreams. We can do so much to make the world a better place. The advantage of financial wellbeing can make a person indulgent, rob him of the true measure of meaningful accomplishment and allow him to live a shallow life; or it can give him the ability to make a difference in the world that cries out for compassion, action and commitment.'' Mr. Moldaw's family is planning a private service. A memorial celebration of his life will take place at a later date. The family requests that any memorial gifts be made to The Moldaw-Zaffaroni Boys and Girls Club of East Palo Alto, Eastside College Preparatory School, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and The Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"You can have your Kentucky Derby and all its ersatz tradition and dubious charm (the last time the world saw so many loud, boozy people in funny hats, the Vikings were sacking Irish monasteries). The season's best horse racing experience, for my money, is the Travers Stakes, held each August in Saratoga Springs, a placid little spa town in upstate New York. The Travers, known to the horsy set as the Midsummer Derby and regarded by some as the fourth leg of the Triple Crown, is where the racing season hits the quarter pole, and the event reliably draws a handful of the best 3-year-olds in the land. There's wonderful history here: it's the country's oldest major thoroughbred race, run in one of the country's oldest major sporting venues (a gorgeous one, at that) -- and it is nothing less than the quintessence of horse racing, the sport of kings and scoundrels alike. Some background: Saratoga Race Track was the brainchild of John ''Old Smoke'' Morrissey, a Tammany Hall hack who allegedly masterminded the killing of New York's infamous gang lord Bill the Butcher. Under Morrissey's stewardship, and with financing from the New York stockbroker William Travers, Saratoga hosted its first thoroughbred meeting in 1863, and the first Travers Stakes was run the following year. In the 1921 Travers, in a two-horse race, a colt named Sporting Blood upset the heavy favorite, Prudery -- a result that might be regarded less suspiciously had a third horse not mysteriously scratched and had Sporting Blood's owner, Arnold Rothstein, not been accused of fixing the 1919 World Series. ''Saratoga is the wickedest spot in the United States,'' wrote the journalist Nellie Bly, where ''gamblers, horse owners, jockeys, millionaires and actors mingle together promiscuously.''"
2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Just before Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Amsterdam's pre-eminent art dealer, Jacques Goudstikker, who was Jewish, escaped by ship with his wife and young son. He died in a shipboard fall, and the fortune in fine art he left behind was possessed by the Nazi leader Hermann Göring. In 2006 the Dutch government returned 200 paintings from the Goudstikker collection to their rightful heir, Marei von Saher, the widow of the dealer's son and a resident of Greenwich, Conn. How great was the Goudstikker collection? Pretty great, judging by a beautiful display of 40 paintings included in ''RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,'' at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich. A specialist in northern Baroque art, Mr. Goudstikker sold paintings not only to Dutch and other European museums but also to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and to Andrew Mellon for the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Dating mostly from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, the paintings in the exhibition all look like pieces those institutions would still have on their wish lists."

But this is Oakland, Calif. Our first inkling that something unusual might be up on the block came only weeks after we moved into the house with the big redwood tree in 2001. Dazed migrants from New York, we were surrounded by a sea of boxes on Sept. 11, watching the horrific news on the TV parked on the floor. At some point, the doorbell rang.

In politics, he was a longtime, active Democrat who was appointed by President Clinton as a Public Delegate to the U.S. Mission at the United Nations in 1993 and as Chairman of the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars in 1996. In 2000, Gov. Gray Davis appointed Mr. Moldaw to chair California's World Trade Commission, and two years later to a serve as commissioner on the states Little Hoover Commission. In 2006, Mr. Moldaw captured his personal story in a book titled A Life Story For My Grandchildren. He wrote: ''My greatest happiness came not from money and possessions but from engagements, accomplish ments, challenges, the camaraderie with the people I have met along the way, and the love of my family. I also hope that my grandchildren will come to understand the joy of helping their less fortunate fellows to fulfill their dreams. We can do so much to make the world a better place. The advantage of financial wellbeing can make a person indulgent, rob him of the true measure of meaningful accomplishment and allow him to live a shallow life; or it can give him the ability to make a difference in the world that cries out for compassion, action and commitment.'' Mr. Moldaw's family is planning a private service. A memorial celebration of his life will take place at a later date. The family requests that any memorial gifts be made to The Moldaw-Zaffaroni Boys and Girls Club of East Palo Alto, Eastside College Preparatory School, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and The Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"OUTPOSTS There are people with us still who remember the Great Plains in its birthday suit. Once, the grassland spanned at least 14 states, from Minnesota to Texas, the second biggest ecosystem in North America. It's gone because the grass was overturned and the bison were chased off the land and the riot of biodiversity that had evolved over 10,000 years was replaced by a few commodity crops to feed us. It's not worth arguing over whether this was a good or a bad thing, because most of the intentions were good, even if the excesses were bad. But it's always worthwhile to wonder whether humans can fix what they messed up."

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"CEDAR LAKE CONTEMPORARY BALLET and its artistic director, Benoit-Swan Pouffer, have not received quite enough credit for bringing to New York a number of little-seen choreographers, often already popular in Europe, and commissioning them to create new work. In January the troupe offered pieces from Jacopo Godani, Stijn Celis and Crystal Pite; none were very well known here, but Ms. Pite in particular was a distinctive new voice. And starting Monday the company's spring season offers another intriguing batch of dances: a new work, ''Sunday, Again,'' by the Norwegian choreographer Jo Stromgren; Angelin Preljocaj's ''Annonciation,'' an important work in his career; and a reprise of ''Lasting Imprint,'' a piece created for Cedar Lake by Nicolo Fonte in 2006. Mr. Preljocaj is the best known of the bunch, but even his work is infrequently seen in New York. In his native France ''L'Annonciation,'' a 1995 piece for two women, is one of his more popular pieces; it's in the repertory of the Paris Opera Ballet and other companies. Set to fragments of Vivaldi's ''Magnificat'' and an electronic score by Stéphane Roy, it offers a lyrical, sensuous account of the encounter between Mary and the Angel Gabriel that shows Mr. Preljocaj's ability to evoke intense emotion through a vivid physicality. Mr. Stromgren is more of an unknown quantity, but we can always hope -- at a time when ballet companies almost universally play it safe -- that discovery is at hand."

Close, US Air Force, Retired, died in Bluffton, South Carolina, May 23, 2008 after 90 years of service to his Country and devotion to his family. A command pilot with more than 7000 flying hours to his credit, General Close was born in Columbus, Ohio and raised in New York City and Los Angeles. This graduate of Beverly Hills High School and Stanford University joined the Army Air Corps in 1939, earned his wings and commission at Kelly Field, Texas, and subsequently went on to a distinguished military career which included flying ''the hump'' in the China-Burma-India theater as a B-29 squadron commander and leading B-29s out of the Mariana Islands as a group operations officer in 1945. General Close returned from World War II after 600 combat hours and 35 missions. In 1952 he commanded the 98th Bomb Wing at Yokota Air Base, Japan where he flew 21 more combat missions over Korea. During the Cold War the General played an integral role in the Strategic Air Command and Operation Looking Glass. His career culminated with his command of JT2 at Sandia Base, New Mexico, working directly under the Joint Chiefs. The General retired in 1968, and moved with his wife, the former Joan Millsop of Weirton, West Virginia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where this former college polo and tennis player found time to express his athleticism as a Champion golfer. General Close was preceded in death by his wife of 55 years in 1998. He is survived by his four daughters: Leslie Joan Close of Bellevale, NY; Christine Campbell of Colorado Springs; Joey Close Baffico of Montclair, NJ; Barbara Vote of Hillsboro, Oregon; and, five grandchildren. The General's ashes were interred on Hilton Head Island on May 30, 2008. ''Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.''"

2008-06-01T00:00:00Z,"Forget the rites of spring. Give me the rites of late summer. July marks the start of N.F.L. training camp, the first opportunity to comfortably act like a football fanatic. It is at camp, before the N.F.L. enters its grandiose regular-season mode, that the game can be enjoyed in a more casual setting. Players are housed in the dorms of small colleges like the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind. On check-in day, quarterback and lineman alike arrive lugging pillows and TV sets. After a few days of sequestration, the undergraduate impulse kicks in, and some rookie will inevitably try to break curfew. If you should happen to run into him at the local bar, so much the better. It is this rare sense of intimacy that always drove me to make the trip to camp. As a kid, I watched the Dallas Cowboys train in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Before the morning drills, I would station myself near the locker room and pester star players with impunity. After practice, we kids would typically get to lug the players' helmets back to the locker room. I once asked the second-string kicker if I could do him the honor, and he gave me a weak, almost apologetic smile. He hadn't expected to make the roster, much less get valet service."

He died June 1 in the arms of his family after a courageous 17 month battle with endstage esophageal cancer. Born on April 28, 1936, he was a graduate of Brooklyn Prep, Fordham University (B.A. 1960) and St. John's University (LLB 1966). Bill married Mary Anne Heyman on February 4, 1961, whose decision to marry him, he later said, made him ''the luckiest man alive''. He served in the US Army from 1957-1958, and again in 1961. He was a clerk to Federal Court Judge Richard Levet, a founder and senior partner of Ford Marrin Esposito Witmeyer and Gleser, recipient of honorary doctorates from Fordham University, St. John's University, the College of St. Elizabeth and Niagara University and claimed his greatest successes as the births of his six children and eight grandchildren. Bill served as an Essex County Democratic Committeeman. An active member of St. Casssian Church in Upper Montclair, NJ, he was a founding trustee of the North Jersey Inter-Religious Task Force on Central America and a member of the Commission on Justice and Peace for the Archdiocese of Newark. After the December 2, 1980 murder in El Salvador of his sister Ita and her companions, Bill tenaciously sought to bring those directly responsible for the deaths of his sister and her three religious companions to justice. For over 22 years, Bill worked unceasingly to hold those in command positions responsible for the death of his sister and so many Slavadoran victims. His efforts laid the groundwork for the eventual successful prosecution of two Salvadoran generals. His personal courage, integrity and undying love of family are the hallmarks of a life well lived. He will be forever remembered by the quiet kindnesses he did for so many. May his soul rest in peace. Visitation Tuesday, June 3 from 2-4 and 7-9pm at the Hugh Moriarty Funeral Home, 76 Park Street, Montclair, NJ. Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Wednesday, June 4 at 10:30am at St. Cassian Church, 187 Bellevue Avenue, Upper Montclair, NJ.

Mr. Godard, one of the founders of the French New Wave of the 1960s, canceled the trip to the Tel Aviv International Student Film Festival, citing “circumstances beyond his control,” festival organizers said Monday. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel urged Mr. Godard in an open letter last week to “take a courageous stand and cancel your trip to Israel.” The letter asked: “Did you ever go to an Afrikaner film festival in apartheid South Africa? Why Israel, then?” Reuters said a source in Mr. Godard’s office declined to comment but said he had canceled his visit for political reasons. Festival organizers said they were disappointed but respected Mr. Godard’s decision. Pro-Palestinian groups frequently call on prominent cultural and academic figures to boycott Israel because of its occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip."

2008-06-03T00:00:00Z,"d'HARNONCOURT--Anne, was a highly respected force in the art world, who led the way for women in the rarified area of museum directorship. She, along with her husband, curator Joe Rishel, brought so much, not only to Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Museum itself, but also to the art world as a whole both nationally and internationally. Anne was a true visionary who had an incredibly keen eye for both art and for people. She was a kind and compassionate friend to so many of the artists that she supported. Anne's stature, presence and old world elegance will be sorely missed by the art community that respected her so greatly, and by us, as a dearly loved friend and colleague. Agnes Gund and Daniel Shapiro d'HARNONCOURT--Anne. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the sudden death of Anne d'Harnoncourt. Her father, Rene d'Harnoncourt, became Director of the Museum in 1949 and retired almost 20 years later in 1968. Anne's strong ties to MoMA began during this time as she developed her passion for the visual arts. After completing her graduate studies in the history of art she joined the museum profession, which she has served with exemplary distinction, first as a curator and then as Director of The Philadelphia Museum of Art for more than twenty-five years. Besides her expertise in surrealist artists, especially Marcel Duchamp, Anne demonstrated an informed enthusiasm for the wide range of art, from the ancient to the contemporary, represented in The Philadelphia Museum of Art collections. Visual arts organizations and museum colleagues across the nation sought her counsel, which was always wisely and generously given. We shall miss her astute intelligence, good humor, and graciousness. We extend our deepest sympathies to her husband, Joe Rishel. David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman Ronald S. Lauder, Honorary Chairman Robert B. Menschel, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, President Emerita Donald B. Marron, President Emeritus Jerry Speyer, Chairman Marie-Jose Kravis, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art d'HARNONCOURT--Anne. The Association of Art Museum Directors is shocked and deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend Anne d'Harnoncourt. Anne defined leadership for a field committed to the public understanding and appreciation of art. As a scholar, esteemed curator, and one of the most admired directors of any art museum in this country or abroad, Anne will be missed by the innumerable people she has helped personally and by the many who have sought to follow her example. Gail Andrews, President, Association of Art Museum Directors d'HARNONCOURT--Anne. Christie's mourns the loss of Anne d'Harnoncourt, a great art world leader. Christopher Burge, Honorary Chairman Stephen S. Lash, Chairman Marc Porter, President d'HARNONCOURT--Anne. The Trustees and faculty of Bard College mourn the passing of Anne d'Harnoncourt, friend and honorary alumna. She was a great and distinguished leader in the world of art and culture. We extend our deepest condolences to her family. Leon Botstein, President Charles P. Stevenson, Jr, Chairman d'HARNONCOURT--Anne. The art world has suffered a very great loss. At this incomprehensibly sad time, our hearts go out to Joe and to Anne's extended family at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Anne was deeply loved and will be very much missed by all who knew her.

2008-06-05T00:00:00Z,"After a four-year absence,ExxonMobil will resume sponsorships of PBS programs this month, PBS announced. ExxonMobil will partly underwrite the news program “Nightly Business Report” and the science program “Nova” through the end of 2008. The company had sponsored “Masterpiece Theater” and other PBS programs for three decades but decided to withdraw its support in 2004. The new sponsorship fills a significant gap for “Nightly Business Report,” a half-hour daily broadcast. One of the show’s two sponsors, A. G. Edwards, ended its support in January, citing budget restraints. The other sponsor, Franklin Templeton, renewed its deal in January. The program still has room for two more sponsors. “Nova” is also underwritten by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and David H. Koch, an owner of Koch Industries.

Mr. DeRogatis read a statement more than a dozen times in response to questions, including whether he had once made a copy of a sex tape that is at the center of the trial. Defense lawyers have said that copying the tape — which is said to show Mr. Kelly having sex with a minor — would have been a crime. Mr. Kelly has said that he was not the man in the tape. After Mr. DeRogatis’s 10 minutes on the stand, Judge Vincent Gaughan of Cook County Criminal Court said reporters’ privileges did not apply. But the judge ruled that Mr. De Rogatis did not have to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination."
