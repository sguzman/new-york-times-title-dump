Suppose there had been no planning regulations in force for the last 100 years or so. Suppose corrupt politicians, lackeys of the crime bosses, had been at the civic helm all along.

1989-07-22T00:00:00Z,"The most amusing sequences in Al (Weird Al) Yankovic's disjointed farce about a UHF channel that beats out its network-affiliated rivals with wacky programming in the mode of ''Pee-wee's Playhouse'' are its spoofs of television ads, children's shows and music-videos. When George Newman (Mr. Yankovic), a nerdy dreamer, takes over the management of his uncle's failing UHF station, he finds himself with an unlikely hit after the channel's sweet, dimwitted janitor, Stanley, takes over a flop children's show called ''Uncle Nutsy's Playhouse.'' Stanley quickly wins hearts dispensing an icky homespun philosophy using his beloved mop as a metaphor for life. Inspired by Stanley's success, George transforms the channel into a kind of Mad magazine of the airwaves, with programs like ''Wheel of Fish,'' advertisements for a chain of stores called Spatula City, and a children's game show in which the first one to find the marble in a tub of oatmeal gets to drink from a fire hose. In ''Raul's Wild Kingdom,'' the host innocently tries to teach dogs how to fly by tossing them out of his apartment window."
